# review_classification
This repo contains code for conducting document classification using BERT for film review documents included in the datasets that are part of the repo.
Film reviews included in the datasets found here are from newspapers written by professonal film critics (who don't always provide a star-rating or any other kind of rating) 
and amateur reviewers on imdb.com.
Document classification for the purpose of this project is based on whether a film review was favorable or unfavorable, and the genre that the film that was reviewed belongs in.
The purpose behind this project was to provide labels for the unlabeled data points so that further analysis could be performed. Mainly document clustering and topic modelling 
to indentify differences betweeen professional and amateur reviewers, considering various characteristics of the films being reviewed (e.g. genre).
