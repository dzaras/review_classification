Because the last time I checked, pyramids weren't built during the Pleistocene. And they weren't exactly walking distance from the last snowy remnants of a diminishing ice age. But what a kvetch I am. So what if this colossally hokey saga mashes up history and geography and climatology and anthropology? So what if it links up land masses that have been unconnected since Pangea broke apart 180 million years ago? Who am I to complain, McGraw-Hill? Publicity materials quote Harald Kloser (who executive produced, co-wrote and co-scored the film) saying he and director/writer Roland Emmerich ``never intended for 10,000 B.C. to be a documentary,'' which is a huge relief. They also quote Emmerich on the little matter of location, helpfully pinpointing the setting as ``our own made-up Africa.'' In filmmaking terms, this means portions were shot in New Zealand (for snowy mountains), South Africa (for the jungle below) and Namibia (for the desert nearby). In narrative terms, it means that African warrior tribes can unite in a jiffy with light-skinned hunters in funky dreads to fight off kind-of Persian, sort-of Egyptian slave-masters building vaguely pre-Columbian or possibly Pharaonic ziggurats assisted by wooly mammoths. The plot, such as it is, follows our hero D'leh (pronounced ``Delay,'' as in postponement or Tom) and three brave comrades as they race to save loved ones kidnapped by these whip-wielding demons on horseback. The loveliest of the loved ones is D'leh's beloved, Evolet, who has blue eyes and a jaw-dropping ability to do absolutely nothing except stand around with her mouth open until the time comes for her to weep, at which point her perfectly applied eyeliner begins to run. Fashionistas and followers of international starlets will be pleased to learn that Evolet is played by Camilla Belle, the terror-stricken baby-sitter in the 2006 remake of \"\"When A Stranger Calls.\"\" Steven Strait, who played \"\"Sky High's\"\" mutant flamethrower, wields a long spear and a giant wig as D'Leh, while the fine kiwi actor Cliff Curtis (\"\"Whale Rider,\"\" \"\"Once Were Warriors\"\") heroically maintains his dignity as D'Leh's rival and mentor, Tic'Tic. And if you can't quite place the crinkly narrator, that's the voice Omar Sharif. It's Dr. Zhivago's job to warn us that \"\"some truths do not survive the ages,\"\" and I'm assuming he means that until now, no one knew that hunter-gatherers wore Maybelline. Visually, 10,000 B.C. boasts the oohs and ahhs of dusky primordial landscapes, huffing slave ships and big-budget CG creatures. The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches, perhaps inspired by 70 million-year-old Gigantoraptor fossils, are idiotic but ... OK, they're idiotic. And the saber-toothed tiger isn't so bad, though it looks about as real as \"\"Diego in Ice Age 2: The Meltdown. \"\" But all the glam effects in the world add up to nil in a corny, derivative and incoherent script that dishes out cheese-fried Apocalypto with a dash of 300. There is fun to be had, however unintentional, when D'Leh halts an advancing army by screaming \"\"Stop! Stop!\"\" Or when he tells his tribesmen, \"\"I keeled thee (mammoth). I claim thee white spear, and weeth it my woman, Evolet.\"\" (Tribesmen: \"\"Yah! Yah! Yah!\"\") And it's worth noting that Emmerich's last film was \"\"The Day After Tomorrow,\"\" the eco-disaster flick that foretold sudden glaciation; until I saw it, I didn't know that you could outrun frost. Here's hoping he won't make yet another movie about yet another Ice Age - for at least another 10,000 years.\n"

            "10,000 B.C. is the latest epic to sail into theaters, telling the courageous, prehistoric story of how far one man will go to save the woman he loves, bring down an evil tyrant and toss his locks manfully at the screen. Wait - it's supposed to take place on Earth? One might find it far easier to view 10,000 B.C. as taking place in a parallel dimension, one in which wooly mammoths act as oxen, New Zealand borders the Amazon and Bob Marley hair is the height of fashion. Unfortunately, its one similarity with Earth is that it has the same clichés. Our hero, D'leh (Steven Strait), wants to rise above his self-doubt and daddy issues. When raiders sack his village and carry off his love interest, Evolet (Camilla Belle), it seems like a great opportunity to do so. We know D'leh is our hero because a windbaggy narrator tells us. Every hero must have his Obi-Wan Kenobi, and D'leh is no different. He's the mentee to the tribe's greatest hunter, Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis), who leaves the defenseless village to join D'leh's rescue effort. Pulling together a few men whom the raiders missed, the group sets off to reclaim its stolen comrades. D'leh soon realizes that to save his love, he must bring down a slave-labor-driven, theocratic civilization. Luckily, a few Zulu warriors offer to help. In a nutshell, 10,000 B.C. is a mashup of Apocalypto, Spartacus, One Million Years B.C.'s Raquel Welch and The Flintstones. The actual film makes little more sense. 10,000 B.C. not only resurrects extinct species and creates fictional Egyptian-Aztec-ish civilizations but does so with no clear logic. D'leh and Evolet have dreadlocks and dirt-stained faces yet sport bleached teeth and mascara. A trek from frigid European mountains to the steamy rain forest to the African desert takes about a week. The rest of the story merely recaps a thousand other ye-olde-hero journeys. Perhaps it's trying to establish the original archetypes - the people who started them. But it goes about it in such a bland way that no one cares. D'leh lacks charisma, Evolet does nothing, and only Tic'Tic seems capable of any spear-stabbing action. The flesh-eating giant predatory birds have far more presence. The evil civilization sparks a bit more interest: A pasty overlord and his flashy groupies rule over it. The one potentially complex character is the nameless warlord (Affif Ben Badra) who leads the attack on D'leh's village and quickly falls for Evolet. But since he's neither hot nor Bob Marley-coiffed, he's just one more villain in need of stabbing. But 10,000 B.C. manages to outdo other recent duds such as In the Name of the King. With few action sequences, such as a wooly mammoth stampede, and unintentional hilarity courtesy of a poorly written script, the film has popcorn entertainment value. It is entertaining but far from engrossing.\n"

            "When the 1962-set \"\"On Chesil Beach\"\" begins, with British honeymooners Edward and Florence strolling along the oceanfront talking teasingly about music - he's into rock 'n' roll, she loves classical - the film hints that it might be as refreshing and uplifting as a summer breeze. The presence of Saiorse Ronan as Florence, whose disarming charms helped ground \"\"Brooklyn\"\" and \"\"Lady Bird,\"\" adds heft to that initial impression. Yet, slowly, through flashbacks of her life and that of her new husband (an impressive Billy Howle) as well as complications that happen after that pleasant walk in the sand, \"\"On Chesil Beach\"\" evolves into something much sadder and more haunting. It climaxes with a hurricane of hurt that is no doubt manipulative and melodramatic but still capable of knocking the wind out of the viewers' emotional sails. Based on Ian McEwan's novel, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and directed by theater director Dominic Cooke, making his feature-film debut, \"\"On Chesil Beach\"\" is PBS-tasteful in its approach, but its power rests in a restraint that makes what it builds to all the more moving. Florence and Edward come from different worlds. Her doggedly, upper-middle-class English family, and especially mother Violet (Emily Watson), who wears her status like an Olympic gold medal, don't particularly care for Edward, the son of a lower-middle-class headmaster (Adrian Scarborough) and an artist (Anne-Marie Duff) left brain-damaged after a tragic run-in with a train. That Florence met Edward at a gathering for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament doesn't count as a selling point for her mom, who has no problem living in a perpetual state of cold war with both Russia and her daughter. The young couple perseveres, but their differences end up running much deeper than rock's wild-eyedwop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bom-bom versus classical's straitlaced sturm-und-drang . Their problems and attitudes revolving around communication, intimacy, manhood and femininity - so very much of their time and class - might seem bewilderingly anachronistic to a younger generation that can't imagine a world before Google, Oprah and self-help philosophers. But they mirror the tenor of the times. Ronan and Howle, who also appear together in another current movie, \"\"The Seagull,\"\" are finely matched, while the supporting cast - including Watson, Samuel West as Florence's father, and Bebe Cave as her sister - are pitch-perfect as well. The last time Ronan appeared in a movie adapted from a McEwan novel, it was \"\"Atonement,\"\" a 2007 film nominated for seven Oscars, including a supporting nod for the actress. Some fans of the book, which I've not read, have groused that Cooke has kept the skeletal frame of the novel but removed its beating heart, replacing it with a smothering gentility, even though McEwan himself wrote the screenplay. That may be true, but \"\"On Chesil Beach\"\" is still no carefree day at the shore.\n",

            "Fairy tales and feminism haven't always seen eye to eye. Damsels in distress awaiting a handsome rescuer and demure beauties pining for a Prince Charming don't fit the mold of the take-charge female. But \"\"Ever After\"\" proves that women can have their romantic visions and their empowerment, too. Drew Barrymore doesn't need help from any men - or fairy godmothers - in this \"\"realistic\"\" recasting of the Cinderella saga. Writer-director Andy Tennant makes no secret of his political motivations. The father of two daughters, he wanted to make a movie for them that embraced fairy tales' optimism without endorsing their sexism. The message is that dreams can come true, but not if you just sit around waiting for someone else to make it so. Danielle (Barrymore) lives in the 16th century but comes from the late 20th century. She has a can-do attitude melded with a strong sense of political correctness. Despite living in a culture that segregates people by gender and class, she refuses to classify anyone by their station. Her widowed father dies shortly after marrying Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston), who has two daughters of her own - Marguerite (Megan Dodds in her first significant film role) and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey, \"\"Heavenly Creatures\"\"). Rodmilla has no interest in or love for Danielle. Marguerite and Jacqueline live a pampered life, while Danielle is reduced to a glorified servant. Meanwhile, the king has ordered his son, Prince Henry (Dougray Scott, \"\"Deep Impact\"\"), to marry the daughter of the king of Spain in order to cement the political ties between their countries. When Henry objects on the grounds that he doesn't love the Spanish woman, his father gives him five days to come up with an alternative bride. News of Henry's search spreads quickly. Rodmilla immediately pushes her daughters to the front of the line. Henry is struck by Marguerite's beauty, and Rodmilla steps up her campaign to orchestrate a royal wedding. What she doesn't know is that Henry also met Danielle and was bowled over by her forthright attitude. When Rodmilla learns that Marguerite's competition is Danielle, she's furious. Huston rarely turns in anything less than a great performance, so it's no surprise that her rendition of the evil stepmother is right on the mark. She's so nasty as she's barking out orders that you wish Latrell Sprewell would make a cameo appearance to choke her. Barrymore's convincing performance is a bit surprising, however. The former \"\"E.T.\"\" phenom's career hit the skids with a series of bad-girl roles - both on and off screen. Now she's fighting her way through a comeback. She parlayed small gigs in \"\"Everyone Says I Love You\"\" and \"\"Scream\"\" into a featured role in \"\"The Wedding Singer.\"\" This is her first shot at playing the leading lady, and she makes the most of it with a performance that underscores her character's strength and conviction. Tennant, who made his name on TV's \"\"The Wonder Years,\"\" hasn't abandoned all the trappings of fairy tales. The movie has a luminous, romantic look enhanced by elegant settings. A note for parents: The film is rated PG-13 based primarily on a scene in which Henry utters four consecutive profanities. There's no sex or violence. The string of cursing comes as shock, not only because it is so out of step with the rest of the film but also because it seems so pointless. \n",

            "GHOST Town opens with a brief shot of a New York City street, emptied of its usual human hustle: the Big Apple as a ghost town in the traditional sense. But the image fades. And the title, we learn, refers to overpopulation. \"\"New York is lousy with ghosts,\"\" whines a recent spectral arrival, a gadabout adulterer named Frank. Portrayed by Greg Kinnear in a crisp black tux unspoiled by the bus that whacked him sideways, Frank has unfinished business with his widowed wife, Gwen (Téa Leoni), who is now engaged to \"\"a real scumbag lawyer - a bad, bad guy.\"\" And he can't do a danged thing about it without Bertram Pincus, D.D.S., whom he recruits from across the ether to sabotage Gwen's upcoming marriage. Three things you must know about Bertrum Pincus. One: He is a misanthropic dentist, arguably the most misanthropic dentist to grace the screen since Little Shop of Horrors. Two: He sees dead people, lots and lots of dead people, and he appears to be the only living soul on the isle of Manhattan who can. Three: He's played by Ricky Gervais, which means both his misanthropy and his dentistry are somehow maddeningly funny. Perhaps it's that stammering inability of his to complete most any thought in normal linear fashion. Before our eyes, sentences disintegrate into a sandy clutter of fragments, hemming and hand jives. Or perhaps it's his face, that exquisite, pasty canvas of vanity and fear - a face that can accommodate blanched terror and ridiculous self-absorption simultaneously, with room to spare for loneliness, pigheadedness and the less quantifiable strangeness of an alien interloper who hasn't yet decoded earthling communications. Gervais obviously hails from another planet, or short of that, the original BBC version of The Office. But there's also a gentleness to the man - like E.T., he comes in peace - that warms up in the middle of Ghost Town, when he dials down the testy iconoclasm and joins the human race. This being a romantic comedy, sparks will fly between Bertram and Gwen. This being a supernatural comedy, pushy ghosts will drop in on Bertram at inopportune times in anachronistic (or merely absent) clothing, asking for help in pursuit of worldly closure. Much of this is familiar enough from Ghost or The Sixth Sense or, to rewind several decades, Topper - in which Constance Bennett and a tuxedoed Cary Grant were glam dead marrieds who couldn't R.I.P. until they cheered up a fuddy-duddy friend. As Frank, Kinnear has swiped both the bowtie and the scrunched brow from Grant, who, it's worth noting, was fictionalized as a suave ectoplasmic advice-giver in 2004's That Touch of Pink. (Kyle McLachlan played him, natch cum tux.) But if the plot of Ghost Town sounds like a retread, its whimsy and sweetness work like a charm. There is so much to like in this kooky, kind-hearted and often hilarious film: Leoni's spunk; Gervais' shock; a mummy-inspection bit featuring organs in canopic jars; an absurd monologue on ``self-righteous teeth.\"\" A scene between Bertram and a surgeon who performs his colonoscopy (Saturday Night Live's Kristen Wiig) is a tour de force of dissembling cross-talk and half-mumbled interruptions - to say more would ruin the fun. Here and elsewhere, the timing is delicious. With lesser talent in front of the camera or a heavier hand behind it, the film might have crashed with a thud. But in his first directorial effort since 2004's half-baked Secret Window, David Koepp (who wrote Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) joins his bent for supernatural storytelling with a nimble comic touch. He and co-scribe John Kamps turned out a high-spirited screenplay, but then he did a wise thing - he backed off. He gave Gervais room to be Gervais, letting scenes play out with lovely absurdist rhythms. Sometimes, a smart director turns into a ghost himself.\n",

            "ROLE Models is not a Judd Apatow movie, but you're forgiven for thinking it is. It stars Paul Rudd, a veteran of \"\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\"\" and \"\"Knocked Up,\"\" alongside Seann William Scott, who isn't but should have been. It features Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Superbad's spurious Hawaiian organ donor, as well as lots and lots (and lots) of booty-obsessive slacker humor that eventually gives way to warm life lessons and a late-onset, but utterly sincere, emotional maturation. The only thing missing from this Apatowannabe is Seth Rogen, now found wearing short-shorts in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Which, come to think of it, might have been Apatow's, too: It hails from the squishy heart and potty mouth of Kevin Smith, who was Judd Apatow before Judd Apatow. And it co-stars Elizabeth Banks, Rudd's conflicted love interest in Role Models. Then again, Role Models actually generates laughter. It hits the proverbial funny bone - to name a safely G-rated body part - with welcome force and regularity, despite a few stock gimmicks and multiple screenwriters. It was directed by David Wain (from whence came the biblical strangeness of The Ten) and co-written by Wain, Rudd, Timothy Dowling and repeat Wain collaborator Ken Marino, who also pops up onscreen in a small role as a boob stepfather. The premise is straightforward enough. Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) are a coupla schmucks who hawk Minotaur energy drink (Wheeler calls it \"\"nuclear horse\"\" wee) to school kids at anti-drug assemblies. On one particularly awful day, Danny gets rejected by his girfriend and decompresses by quaffing can after can of Minotaur, then crashing the enormously horned company pickup into an equestrian statue. As punishment, he and Wheeler are told to choose between jail time and 150 hours of community service at Sturdy Wings, a Big Brother-y program run by a live wire (the sublimely twitchy Jane Lynch) in recovery from everything. She assigns Wheeler to Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a squirt with a bloodcurdling vocabulary. He's a riot. As one of those smut-conversant moppets so often found in comedies these days, he's also just about unquotable - aside from \"\"If you're white, then you're Ben Affleck,\"\" one of the year's best false inductions. Danny, meanwhile, gets assigned to Augie (Mintz-Plasse), a caped dweeb who comes to life in live-action fantasy role-playing punctuated by Alacks, Alays, and thwacking Styrofoam swordplay. Augie pineth for a fair maiden, and while he's never actually spoken with her, he has \"\"killed her a couple times in battle.\"\" Wain and his convocation of screenwriters play up the subcultural wackiness (I loved Ken Jeong as a vainglorious monarch in a plastic crown), but they show nothing but kindness toward Augie. They don't mock Augie for being a part of it. If Role Models is out to humiliate anyone, it's Danny and Wheeler: Danny for being a joyless and pinch-faced contrarian; Wheeler for his randiness, recklessness and platitudinous chitchat. \"\"When one door closes, another opens,\"\" he says: At last, a lech happy to paraphrase Reverend Mother in The Sound of Music. The film tosses around KISS homages (Wheeler's) and deadpan repartee (Danny's) with the same coarse verve, lending additional time to close-in reaction shots that give the humor extra kick. None of it's all that groundbreaking. No boundaries get pushed, not even the once-sacred barrier between four-letter words and peppy moralizing: Apatow helped bomb that one to rubble. Role Models crosses plenty of familiar territory, but Wain and his merry band of mischief-makers offer a likeable, laughable mix of testosterone and heart. \n",
