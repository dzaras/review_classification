Kisses             ,gradyharp,1,drama,2010,NA,"Some may balk at naming this a Christmas movie because of the subject matter, while others will see the reason for terming this very near perfect film as such. First, it takes place at Christmas, and second it is a story as sweet as the Gift of the Magi as far as different tales on the concept of gift giving. Lance Daly both wrote and directed KISSES and cast two extraordinary young actors in the main roles. His use of black and white to color in filming and his decision to focus the musical score on the works of Bob Dylan are two further bits of evidence that this is a man with a solid career before him. In an unnamed little town in Ireland adjoining families live in rather squalid psychological conditions. Kylie (Kelly O'Neill) lives with her parents and siblings in a state of constant bickering and chaos: Kylie's uncle has in the past added his own brand of psychological trauma to her life as we hear later in the film. Next door lives Dylan (Shane Curry), a lad Kylie's age who lives with a severely abusive father and submissive mother. It is Christmas Eve and there is not a bit of joy in the air: Kylie is sent off to walk the baby and is verbally abused by schoolmates while Dylan finally is fed up with his father's behavior (Paul Roe) and after a scuffle flees out the window - with Kylie's help. The two youngsters cannot bear their disgusting family situations and off they go, finding a ride with a riverboat dredger captain (David Bendito) who introduces the to the songs of Bob Dylan. The two end up in Dublin where they struggle for food and shelter, encounter some rather gross behaving people, as well as meeting good people like Bob Dylan (Stephen Rea) for a moment and as they look for Dylan's long vanished brother they meet a street girl (Elizabeth Fuh) who when asked how she survives plying her trade tells Dylan that her only gift to people she meets is a kiss - and she gently kisses Dylan on the cheek. After finding that life on the streets of Dublin at night is very rough the two seek help from a policeman who helps them return to their homes. But a bond has been formed between Kylie and Dylan and the story just ends. Lance Daly is a sensitive director; the portions of the story taking place in the home of the kids are shot in black and white and it is only as Kylie and Dylan discover Bob Dylan's music courtesy of the dredger does the film gradually turn to color. He also is unafraid to show the joys of the two kids as they buy things in Dublin (Kylie's uncle gave her some hush money) and shoe skate around in their new found freedom and happiness, a factor that makes the rest of the story - which is rather dreary and sad - palatable. The two young actors are superb and the music of Bob Dylan floods the screen. This is a small budget film with a big message. And part of that message is about the significance of a simple gift.

Wanted             ,theoneeggy,1,action,2008,1,"I watched this movie the other day, and I was actually quite excited. However, I was quickly turned from this opinion within the first 30 minutes of the movie. It got progressively worse until the ending, starting with the mass-murder/suicide and then the replay - revenge hit at the end of the movie. This ending was simply painful. Morgan Freeman is killing his career with movies like this. I appreciate the writers ability to adapt graphic novel to the big screen, but in all honesty this has to be the worst comic book or graphic novel movie ever. Save yourself the time and do something that will at least stimulate your brain: READ THE BOOK, forget the movie 1"
Good Dick             ,adamaant,1,misc,2010,9,"I'm a man and I just got out of a relationship very similar to the one pictured in this movie. From the sexual issues to the angry defensiveness. I can also relate to him in how he knew that underneath it she did love him, or care about him, that she had something that was holding her back.I can say that relationships like this are next to impossible though. Lucky for them both she decided to face her issues and that may have lead to something real. I would guess more often someone faced with these kind of emotional problems will end up losing to the problem rather than having it work out. My heart went out to both characters, but it was very hard to watch at times because I can remember times when my ex would say things to me like the character in the movie. And I tried for months to help her or move beyond our issues.Anyway great movie. I love Jason Ritter. Another good movie with him which he plays an utterly different kind of character is the education of Charlie Banks."
Gomorrah             ,Poluprostor,,crime,2008,1,"Gomorra...I've read some comments on how greatly it was directed and the brilliant script that fueled the film, yadda-yadda-yadda, so I thought I'd see the film for myself and well... Actually, it's so poor in every respect I don't know where begin!Directing? Mediocre at best! Characters? Lifeless, with a confusingly high level of retardation. Plot? I didn't see one, except for a bunch of quasi-gangster guys running around getting themselves killed and miserable people trying to get by. Should this be surprising, considering the level of corruption in Italy? Hardly. The whole world knows about Italy's general inability to cope with crime. It's practically an integral part of their government and people are lethargic about it. So, what purpose does this movie serve other than to point out the obvious? Apparently, none.My advice to you is go outside for a nice walk or watch something else instead. Over and out!"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,nogazohar,0,misc,2008,1,"I saw this movie with my class today. I never saw ""Step Up""(the first one), but when I see a clichéd movie, I can recognize it. The story begins with a middle class girl called Andie-Who-Is-Motherless-And-Talented and her friends which are street dancers. Of course, Andie, who is nice and modest but full of talent in dancing, is getting into ""art academy""(or whatever it was) and meet a Nerd-But-Talented-Guy-Who-Likes-""Cool""-Music with a really long name that calls himself ""Moose""(sp?). Of course they became friends. Then, to make it more clichéd, she meets the Cool-Talented-Sexy-Guy, and at that moment I can bet they would end up together. Then we get to see the Cool-Beautiful-Girl-Who-Is-Really-Talented that wants the Cool-Talented-Guy. Of course our sweet heroine will have a CatFight with her on the Cool-Talented-Guy. And then, the teacher who is Taugh-But-Professional helps our Andie. Most of the kids in my class saw this movie before, so at the last second of the lesson, they wanted to fast forward and see the cool dance at the end. Then, we saw Andie orate about nonsense to a bunch of boys and girls about street dancing. In short, another wannabe realistic and clichéd film. A waste of time"
Wanted             ,axlrhodes,1,action,2009,6,"For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.

The Escapist             ,jaredmobarak,,crime,2009,8,"While The Escapist may not have an all-star A-list cast, it has a pretty recognizable international one. When I saw the names attached to this thing, I couldn't believe that it had trouble finding distribution. Luckily IFC Films stepped up to the plate and will add it to their VOD schedule to get some exposure for its DVD release. Much like Unknown from a few years back, Rupert Wyatt's film is a hidden gem of intrigue and suspense. A disjointed narrative tells the story of a ragtag bunch of criminals looking to escape from a maximum security prison so that the orchestrator, Brian Cox's Frank Perry, can see his daughter before she dies from drug abuse complications on the outside. Each member of the team has a specialty necessary for the escape to work and/or finds his way on the team through trade, whether consciously or not. You do begin to wonder way Rupert has decided to show it all inter-spliced with flashbacks on how they got together, and when the conclusion is reached you will understand in a surprisingly satisfactory turn of events.Now these names may mean absolutely nothing to you, but on paper they are quite the collaborative team. Cox leads the way in recognition and stature, followed by a favorite of mine Damian Lewis, (in a smaller role than I had anticipated), and Joseph Fiennes. Add in the familiar faces of Steven Mackintosh, Liam Cunningham, Dominic Cooper, and singer Seu Jorge and you've really got something for a film that will probably not be seen by very many people. And that is the real shame here because The Escapist has a lot going for it. With a good marketing push and word of mouth, this had the potential of being a sleeper hit<U+0097>an indie done well. Hopefully IFC viewers will start spreading excitement and help it to achieve cult status of some sort. It may not be as mainstream as ""Prison Break"", but utilizing the same core idea, Wyatt culls together a unique tale that takes more from a film like Jacob's Ladder than pop culture television.It all begins with Cox's Perry, tired and scared, finding Lewis sitting on a cell bed. The next thing we know, Cox joins up with the team as they have just smashed their way into the laundry room, only now he has a bloodied shirt and what can be assumed as a nasty gash to his stomach. We have been dropped right into the escape and now the group is together, putting their plan in motion. But wait, all of sudden we are back in time watching Cox do laundry duty, Cunningham's Brodie putting on an ant race, and Mackintosh's Tony berating newcomer Cooper as he arrives at the prison. The discovery that we are about to go on a journey with the escapees, juxtaposed with how they all came together to plan the event, becomes clear. With sharp cuts, yet coherent story continuity, it all makes sense as both halves reach their crescendos at the end. The plot line of the past thread reaches the point at which the film started and that progression leads to the end of the escape simultaneously. Both meld together as one, revealing what has indeed been going on the entire time, possibly not even parallel timeframes after all.Complete with some very nice camera-work, Wyatt shows some skill as a director. Scenes like that of Mackintosh and Cooper in the showers, fog shrouding their advance into the water, shielding us from what we know is about to happen, really stick out. Even the trip to that end, with Cooper's Lacey being ""helped"" by guards and inmates, opening doors for him to ""hide"" in, plays nicely into the artistry and aesthetic being put on display. The prison is dark and dingy, yet a paradise in comparison with the large expanses of sewers they soon find themselves traveling through. It is a muted palette throughout, making the light at the end of the tunnel (both figuratively and literally) that much brighter in notion and reality. And the way in which we see things happen is with suspense and intrigue. Watching the inmates plan their escape with dominoes as we are shown the real life places they mimic along with extended sequences of rapid process cuts<U+0097>whether they be making drugs, creating a steel cutter, or even a jailhouse brawl<U+0097>many instances beg to be appreciated visually as well as for how well they advance the story.It all ends up being an actors' movie, though, as the performances shine above all else. Fiennes was almost unrecognizable to me at the start. I thought that was him, but something was off. Only after about thirty minutes did I finally realize it, Fiennes performing as a madman ""utility"" guy, nothing like the Shakespearean heroes he is most known for. Lewis is great as the menacing prison czar, always with a smile yet demanding the respect of every inmate with his own brand of punishment the guards look the other way on. And I really liked Seu Jorge's role as Viv Bastista. He is a wild card to the film<U+0097>librarian/drug cook/witness for Lewis' Rizza. What really makes them all so elusive and mysterious, however, even as we learn who they are as men, is the fact that we don't know what has landed any of them in jail. Are they killers? Thieves? Rapists? It doesn't matter. These men all come together for a common cause and work as a team to achieve it. They sacrifice themselves for the others, just as Cox realizes that freedom doesn't have to be of the body, but can also be of the mind."
WALL·E             ,isabelle1955,0,animation,2008,NA,"I very rarely give ten out of ten to a movie, but I have no hesitation in giving that perfect score to WALL-E. It is sublime. Not just the best animation I've seen in a long time, but simply one of the best movies I've seen in many months in terms of coherent and effective story-telling and seamless editing. It's extremely well put together. The animation is in a class of its own. My only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isn't a movie aimed at little kids, and perhaps the marketing strategy is showing too much of the 'cute funnies' and not enough of the sheer artistry of Pixar's vision. This is not a bright, sunny view of the world where everyone lives happily ever after, but quite clearly a message movie; if you agree with the message, you will love this film.Disney may own Pixar these days, but there is an artistic divide between the two production styles. If you want predictable sentimentality watch Disney. I loved Disney's older classics but some of their later offerings <U+0096> with the exception of Beauty and the Beast which was very good - made me wince when I took my kids along. But in contrast I have loved every single film that Pixar have made since Toy Story in 1995, and if you want something more wry, but still possessing humour and heart, then Pixar is probably going to be your choice.The story is simple enough. It's the year 2700 and the earth has become uninhabitable, not through some terrible cataclysmic event, but by a slow accumulation of suffocating junk. It's a wasteland devoid of living things. As the opening shots pan in, we see that the skyscrapers are actually tall mounds of compressed trash, and that the compressing is being done by WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter <U+0096> Earth class), a small, solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts from all his clapped out siblings. WALL-E's only companion is a cockroach, and he fills in the time in his trailer home during long dust storms by watching an old video of Hello Dolly. WALL-E is an unlikely hero, rusty but trusty. I hesitate to use the word cute, endearing works better. One day he finds a single plant growing. He doesn't appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as a Rubic's Cube, a lighter and a trash can lid.Then a space ship lands and EVE emerges (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Eve is in a whole different class to WALL-E. She can fly, he is earth bound, she is sleek, dangerous and single minded while he is bumbling and rather dowdy. They communicate with beeps and eye twitches, and WALL-E is hooked. When WALL-E gives EVE the plant he has found, she recognizes that her directive <U+0096> to find evidence of photosynthesis on earth <U+0096> is fulfilled and shuts down. The ship comes back to pick her up and WALL-E clings on, desperate not to lose her. Arriving at the mother ship, we find the last remaining humans (apparently all American!) who have fled the earth at the behest of the CEO of Buy N Large, a conglomerate who ended up running everything. The humans are pretty much big, obese babies, who have lost the use of their legs and are spoon fed artificial food and platitudinous slogans in equal measure. The rest of the movie involves a plot by the auto pilot to take over the ship and keep it on course away from earth, while the captain tries to take it home, aided by WALL-E and an entertaining array of quirky malfunctioning robots let loose from the repair bay.Some of the best moments are to be found in WALL-E's interaction with everyday objects; a fire extinguisher for example, enables him to zip around in space in a balletic dance with EVE, he uses a lid as a hat to imitate the dancers he sees on his video screen. The humans are not presented as wicked or evil, just unthinking, and the movie ends on a positive and upbeat note, when they recover the use of their legs and return to earth to reclaim it as their home. There are nods to many classic sci-fi movies, Pixar's ubiquitous pizza truck is there near the beginning, and they are not beyond a little self criticism; there's a discarded iPod among WALL-E's accumulated junk.I found myself caring far more about the animated characters in WALL-E than the supposedly human ones in many 'regular' movies. Director Andrew Stanton and everyone at Pixar deserve huge credit for this movie and I hope it is an enormous financial hit for them. I also hope it gets an Oscar nomination, not for best animated feature, but for best film."
Quarantine             ,PIBecky,1,horror,2008,NA,"I found myself frustrated because the camera moved way too much. It started off okay but then the camera moved so much that it was frustrating to anyone who was watching it. The remarks by everyone in the theater made that real clear. I am a private investigator and would loose my clients if I ever let my camera take that type of film. My film has never looked that bad, even when running, crawling or driving. A qualified cameraperson would have never moved the camera that much. It was impossible to see what was really going on in the movie and who was who during most of the time. Whenever a person was observed who had the rabies could not really be seen. The only thing the movie showed was people standing, running or sitting with foam running down their mouth It made me feel sick, frustrated and difficult to enjoy the movie. I was disappointed and would not refer anyone to see this movie."
Space Chimps             ,mungflesh,,animation,2009,4,"The writing in Space Chimps feels very Family Guy esquire, which I am not at all a fan of.Whilst there's (virtually) no offensive language or crudeness, the gags almost solely depend on quick-fire references to other films and TV shows etc. For me, this gets tedious and is a very lazy way to write comedy IMO. For my 3 1/2 year old, it's not possible for him to understand any of the references. He's too young for Space Chimps and if I had known, I wouldn't have taken him. Even for 8 year-olds I think the references would be way before their time. It's as if the gags are written ONLY for adults, which to me puts the film in a no-mans land where it is neither for kids nor their parents.The way CGI films should be made, is that a script meant for real actors, which is technically too costly to achieve ""in the flesh"", can then be made using CGI. In reality, there's probably a think-tank of people who design the visuals and then the script, which is why many of these ventures are weak"
Twilight             ,indigochildren,1,misc,2008,1,"I've never wanted to walk out of a movie so badly. I think you should give the film a chance to develop fully before forming an opinion. This was certainly not a ""film"" with any substance. The acting was horrible, the script was horrible, the whole thing was rushed and insubstantial. For being such a predicted box office hit, given the already large fan base, the budget must have been dismal. I think you would need to be no older than 10 to enjoy this film, but the kissing scene in Bella's bedroom was too passionate for a kid's movie (Bella's in her panties!?). In the books it takes them a long time to move forward with their physical relationship. The story was clearly written with teens in mind but still enjoyable for adults. The movie was a cringer. 1"
The Incredible Hulk             ,springsunnywinter,0,action,2008,10,"By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's originWhen I saw the trailer of The Incredible Hulk I was like ""Wow this movie looks cool"" and it lived up to my expectation also the trailer did not give too much away about the plot. The film was outrageously entertaining, fun and a perfect popcorn movie. It is the same director of The Transporter 2 so it is bound to have good action. You can see every penny spent from the $130 million budget. It is roughly (not exactly) the same amount as Hulk (2003) and The Incredible Hulk looks much, much more expensive.The story is about Bruce Banner who is trying to cure is condition that turns him into a monster but is going to use it as his weapon against the Abomination. The plot may seem simple but it is better that way because you can just concentrate on the action and the monsters.This time the Hulk is more darker and sinister looking and is more muscular than Ang Lee's Hulk. The Abomination was the icing & cherry on the cake and I'm glad that they had a proper villain this time. His name really does match his personality and he is not wearing any underpants, so girls you might want to look away otherwise you might get a fright. Overall this movie is Incredible not an Abomination. 2"
Yes Man             ,goulding_m,0,comedy,2008,10,"Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Carrey, I admit a lot of his comedic performances are somewhat ridiculous. But this is legitimately a sensible comedy where he doesn't use a lot of his ""Rubberface"" antics and actually just acts funny. The premise of this film is intriguing and I loved watching it. Both Jim and Zooey are excellent the story is amazing. All the Carrey-haters should give this one a chance, it really deserves it. I think Jim's most recent movies have been great. It's his older movies that people hate him for. But he's becoming a legit dramatic actor who can also be funny. He sometimes goes over the top, but all-in-all he is a multi-faceted professional. This movie deserves a lot of praise because it is excellent. This brings back flashes of his performance in the extremely popular ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". In closing, give ""Yes Man"" a chance. It's good for some laughs but also offers a very optimistic view on life in general. 1"
21             ,q_tipmann,0,crime,2008,2,"There are three kinds of bad movies. The kind that you'll see for free on HBO or the like if you're bored enough, the kind that are so bad they're actually funny and worth the occasional viewing, and then the kind that you never want to see again. 21 is the latter. And the only reason it got a two instead of a one was Kevin Spacey since he was the only interesting part of the whole movie.You know those movies that leave you with the feeling of ""thank god that's over""? Well, 21 goes above and beyond in terms of bad moviedom and found a way to rob us of that nice, warm, and lovely feeling of accomplishment for managing to sit through the whole thing. Among the incredibly numerous cliché's in this film you find the hero of course getting everything he ever wanted in life at the end yet for some reason the director decided to play ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" during the wrap up portion and credits of the movie. Now I am all for movies that make you think and have a big message at the end but playing ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" while the main character is going over in detail how he did get everything he wanted is like saying violence is bad while shooting someone repeatedly in the head, it just doesn't work.There was one thing I will give the movie. It's predictable. I love the comfortable feeling of knowing that I will be able to predict the course of each and every scene two seconds in to them. I can't stand it when the scene where the main character becomes estranged from his best friends due to varying reasons depending on the movie that are usually incredibly childish springs on me from left field, especially when its followed by the scene showing him losing his cool and doing something stupid, I hate seeing that coming! And I wouldn't have been so touched by his mom offering him $68,000.00 dollars to pay for college if it hadn't been painfully obvious she was about to do so. And of course who would want to not know without even having to think that he was going to refuse the money and make up a lie about why he was because he was ashamed of himself? Because of course no one likes original work, we need more clichés damn it! More story arcs and more recycled characters we all have seen god knows how many times!! I will cease this ragging after I bring up one more point. At the end, surprise surprise, there is a case scene of the main characters running away from the casino security. *SPOILERS* the main character Ben gives the bag of chips to Spacey's character and split up to ditch the guards. Later Spacey opens the bag and its all fake chips and they justify this by showing Ben and his girlfriend Jill switching bags but the problem with that is simple, there was no time. From the moment that Ben had the bag to the point he gave it to Kevin he was with Kevin every step of the way and the shot of the switch they're in a bathroom or some kind of hall, calm and taking their time. It again just doesn't work.I'll admit I didn't have the highest hopes ever for the movie but I had expected it to be better then this. Just keep this in mind if you're thinking about seeing 21, you have seen this movie. You have seen it many times with many different names. But you have in fact seen it. I promise you."
Wendy and Lucy             ,doctorprogress,1,drama,2008,8,"The true triumph of this film is its ability to say so much about the cold, cruel reality of just how close some people are to breaking their banks and their hearts. What fascinates me is: there are a few big budget films out there right now - all scrambling desperately to capture the same themes as W&L - that have no concept of how real people really act and survive. Those filmmakers must be pulling their hair out screaming ""how can she say it all with one woman and a dog, and I can't say a damned thing with all these great special effects???""That is the joy in this film. The simple, honest, brutal truth of now. Enjoy. "
Changeling             ,tomrito,1,misc,2008,9,"Watching this film is like taking a look back in time. Everything is picture perfect, the beautiful automobiles, the red electric street cars, the telephones, the switchboard station with roller-skating supervisors, the house appliances, and the outstanding clothing, from dresses to hats to police uniforms, everything is meticulously detailed. The story, which we are told is true, is complex and multifaceted. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine Collins, gives an outstanding performance as a single mother who returns home from work to find that her son is missing. This puts into motion a series of events that exposes the reality of what Los Angeles society was really like in the late 1920's. Corrupt Police, uncaring and self absorbed mental health professionals and the basic premise that people left to their own ambitions will do anything to secure their own prosperity. Although this paints a bleak picture of the human condition, the film show that the actions of a few good men can make a world of difference, John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is determined to expose the corrupt Police in his radio talk show, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, although hampered by his superiors, uncovers what really happened to the boy and the unlikely hero, a powerful attorney who takes her case pro-bono comes to her rescue. If indeed this is a true story, then to see these people stand up to the powers that be is a ray of hope to all of us that there were people who were strong and principled. We can only hope that there are still people like that out there today. 1"
Julia             ,catsklgd1,1,crime,2012,3,"Julia is a schizophrenic piece of filmmaking if ever there was one. It can't decide whether or not it's a serious drama or a dark comedy. Only a terrific performance by Tilda Swinton in the lead part and a couple of decent bit part performances by American and foreign actors are all that save this pathetic film from rating just one star instead of the three that I mercifully gave it. In fact, the performance by the actress that played the boy's mother bordered on a caricature. Oh sure, there were some decent scenes, but the time between them was filled with inane dialog and implausible plot faults. There were too many unexplained lapses in continuity, including an absurd sequence of events in the Southern California/Mexican desert. The story is so improbable as to be ridiculous and the script is uneven and fractured. I will admit that the cinematography is decent, as is the editing. But to rate this film any more than three stars would be to offer a disservice to those films that actually ""earned"" a rating that was higher than that. Except for Ms. Swinton's excellent performance as a disjointed, delusional, dysfunctional alcoholic, Julia was a complete waste of this viewer's tim"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,comedy,2008,7,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall, definitely the biggest movie that everyone was looking forward to seeing this year. Apatow has had nothing but big success with his comedies: 40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall, their next big hit. Also Jason Segal's first major script brought to life, I have to say he's got talent, the reason I say that? These characters... they're likable! Not only are the likable, they are real and people you could relate too! For example, Sarah Marshall's new boyfriend that she broke up with Peter for, yeah, he's a little bit of a moron, but you know what? You could understand why people liked him, he was pretty cool, even the girlfriend, Sarah, yeah, she was a jerk, but so real and also you don't get too mad at her with her reason on why she fell out of love with Peter. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has great laughs and a fun story.Sarah Marshall: hot actress, beautiful, and a fun person, just broke up with her musician boyfriend, Peter. He's just heartbroken and needs to get away for a while, so he goes to Hawaii, but guess what? Sarah is there with her new rock star boyfriend, Aldous Snow, and things are not seeming to go his way. But when he meets Rachel Jenson, the nice and really pretty hotel clerk, they go out and he ends up realizing that maybe this break up wasn't such a big deal after all.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a funny movie, I guarantee you are going to laugh. I do have one complaint, the male nudity, now it's not that I'm a prude at all, just this was more uncomfortable than funny with Jason exposing all his assets. I don't know, just that type of humor isn't funny with me, male or female, just depending on the joke, but this was more awkward. But I do think this is a fun movie, it has a great story and really makes you laugh and just have a good time with these characters, it's a good recommendation from me.7/10 "
Fireflies in the Garden             ,lgilbertom,0,drama,2009,7,"I watched this movie on DVD and I confess that I rented reluctantly this movie. However, I had a pleasant surprise, the story is about a boy who in his adult version is played by Ryan Reynolds with serious relationship problems with his father (William Dafoe). I am really surprise with Ryan Reynolds performance, also the young Michael with play Cayden Boyd. The whole story in one way or another turn around the problem of relationship between both. The movie uses well the flashback resource to show the problems of this family and especially the problems between Michael and his father. Naturally, there are good interpretations of the rest of the cast especially for Emily Watson(Michael's Aunt). A movie that really is worth watching."
I Sell the Dead             ,carbuff,,misc,2015,8,"Entertaining black comedy. Doesn't have the poignancy, depth, or biting wit to be truly great or emotionally involving, but is still better than 95% of what's out there. The stuff that's gruesome is pretty tame by modern standards. For some reason, the way the film hit me is how I remember the original ""Beatlejuice"", which isn't a bad thing. Not a horror flick at all or even a very dark comedy--more along the lines of a very good late night horror spoof. I just popped some corn, kicked back and had an uncomplicated good tim"
Frost/Nixon             ,tranquilbuddha,0,misc,2008,NA,"Frank Langella's performance as Nixon is truly moving in this remarkable film by Ron Howard, which gripped me for its entirety. As someone who grew up during the Watergate hearings, and who reviled Nixon as the embodiment not just of corruption but of the worst kind of interventionist, even genocidal, American politics, this film gives substance to a man who, in later years (especially the GW Bush years, which make Nixon look like a political and intellectual colossus), achieved something of a place in history beyond the scandal of Watergate.But what Frost/Nixon - and in particular Langella - does is give humanity to the man. We see his arrogance, his love of power, his need to win (hinted at wonderfully in a moment when he is jogging in his San Clemente home to rousing music), but we also see his inner conflicts, his regrets, the fact that perhaps more than simply his crimes regarding Watergate haunted him - that the impact of his decisions on South East Asia were not entirely remote from him, either. And in a sequence that I will not reveal, to avoid spoiling the plot, we also see a hint of his madness, for it is that, I think, rather than senility. (You have to see it to understand this.)Ron Howard and playwright/screenwriter Peter Morgan have achieved a remarkable feat in adapting the stage play, which sadly I did not see. Not for a moment does this feel stage bound; instead it is a compelling human portrait of two men - for Frost is fascinating, too, and Michael Sheen captures both his much criticized (at the time) surface gloss and also his deeper fears - but above all of the impact that each of our decisions, large and small, and not least if you are leader of the ""Free World,"" have on us all."
Nights in Rodanthe             ,Otoboke,1,drama,2008,NA,"Starting off with a promising first act with lightly interesting and developed characters, rich in personality and with hints of chemistry between the two love interests, Nights in Rodanthe is a train wreck if ever there was on; giving meaning to the fact that even if a movie starts out well, it can end up in the gutter pretty quickly. Following on from the opening, the movie then resorts to cheap melodramatic contrivances, and demeans both its characters and performers by negating their roles to mere romantic plot devices used to set up act three's ridiculously sappy ending. The middle act, which finds both characters slowly falling for each other, isn't all that bad, and while it does get irksome towards the end, even such a closing would have saved the movie from being a complete disaster. Nevertheless, with a few moments of interest, usually inherent in the performance of Gere, Nights in Rodanthe isn't without its positives, but you certainly have to do a lot of looking to find them.As a romantic drama, Nights tries to do one thing and one thing only and that is to make with the mushy. Director George C. Wolfe in his big screen debut here opts to take this to an extreme however, and even goes to the point of rejecting any focus at all on characters past the half-way mark. After this point, Nights in Rodanthe turns into a holiday from hell. Mawkish, banal and overly pretentious, both Wolfe and the writers here adopt a tone of whimsy light-headedness that often clashes with the story's much more serious (at least, that's what it tries to be) subplot involving a death caused by one of these characters. What's more annoying is that the movie's earlier sequences, which although clearly unfocused and seemingly directionless, at least had some humanity present in its central figures, these earlier moments of promise are forgotten. After forty minutes or so, all that's left for Wolfe to do is to drag on the romance as far as he can to the point where we're no longer watching real people fall in love, we're simply watching an outline for a romance movie. Character A and Character B going through the motions<U+0085> Yawn. Haven't we done this before? To be fair both performers try and make the best of their undoubtedly tricky situation. Throughout there are moments of genuine chemistry between both Gere and Lane, and while the romance isn't exactly palpable enough to sustain much interest past the halfway mark, they at least keep the thing going as best as they can. Essentially however you get the feeling that both would rather be somewhere else; in between these instances of chemistry are scenes which fail to deliver any emotion whatsoever, even though the director seems sure that what he's doing is going to get your eyes watery. The truth is, Nights in Rodanthe is a sappy, overly emotional romantic drama; so much so that it's absurd. I can't feel for these people and I can't feel for their petty outbreaks of self-loathing angst. When I begin arguing with characters in my head whilst I'm obviously supposed to be feeling pity for them, I disconnect; it's over. Stop trying to engage me. This happened an hour into Nights in Rodanthe, and although I could have been won back, sadly it only gets worse from there.It's hard to see why anyone would enjoy such a film. Sure enough if you're a major fan of ""weepies"", for some reason enjoy watching people cry a lot and don't mind romance that feels generic and predictable then you might just get something from Nights, but even then you'll probably feel under-whelmed. There's no denying I had hope for this film; with Gere and Lane helming what looked to be a mature love story, I figured the worst that could happen would be if I was subjected to a teaspoon of fairy tale whimsy. Unfortunately however, I did get that, and I also got a shallow, unremarkable feature that was essentially a few scenes drawn out far too long with a third act that wasn't necessary or even enjoyable in the slightest. Some decent individual performances throughout, but with limited chemistry and an overwritten, overly romanticised script, Nights in Rodanthe isn't a night to remember by any means.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
Wanted             ,andy-1978,1,action,2009,8,"This is a very easy to watch action packed movie. It delved into your imagination and as long as you are not expecting a true to life action drama you should love it. I am not normally struck on the matrix style movies but I really liked this film. The story is not be taken too seriously, just go with the flow of the film and watch the stunts and special effects. Putting Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman in the movie had to be a good move with the box office bucks. But the ace card for this movie in my opinion is James McAvoy who plays the geeky guy who turns into a top assassin. At first I did not recognize James McAvoy from his previous roles like "" The last King of Scotland "" and ' Wimbledon "". When I did realize it was the same actor I understood what a fab actor he truly is. He portrays his character with absolute ease. His transition in his role from the start of the movie to his ending character is class. James I am a true fan !! The movie is a good watch if you are into this type of movie."
The Express             ,TamPalm,,misc,2008,7,"Really I think more like a 6.5 or 6.75 is a more appropriate rating. But it DEFINITELY deserves higher than the 5.4 it has now on this site! Wow, I was surprised to see such a low score. The movie is not the best movie ever, but it is good. The acting is stellar. The story is inspirational. It's a feel-good movie and it's family-friendly to boot, which warrants some kind of kudos in my book. I think the plot could have been fleshed out a little more, and perhaps a better writer or director (I have no idea who wrote or directed this by the way) could have brought more drama and impact to the script. But even with a mediocre script, it's a memorable movie. My criteria is this: if I'm thinking about the movie after I walk out of the theater, it's a winner. This story touched me and it was delivered in a way that hit that ""special"" place in my heart, and I'm not a pansy. So I say, give it a try. You won't be bored, you might not be thrilled, but you will smile and feel all tingly inside, and isn't that just about enough? I think so. See it"
The Reader             ,paulmamak,1,drama,2009,7,"Stephen Daldry hit the nail on the head for his interpretation of the novel. His choice of location, cinematography and casting were spot on, which enabled him to deliver a well depicted version of the novel.Kate Winslet and David Kross were the backbone of the film, as they portrayed Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz, respectively, as they were written in the novel. Ultimately, their chemistry and interplay was particularly electrifying and makes the audience really feel for their characters. Surprisingly, Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the older Michael Berg was a major let down, as he did a poor job in emphasising the pain and suffering that the character goes through.The court scene is another disappointment. Although it is depicted as written in the novel, the scene would have been strengthened if the film makers had shown flash backs of the events surrounding the Holocaust, which was the major event of this film.The film is worth watching, but it is no masterpiec"
The Express             ,pjmbdm,,misc,2008,10,"My husband and I saw EXPRESS yesterday and truly enjoyed this movie. We love movies based on true stories and also enjoy sports so this was a winning combination! We found this movie to be truly captivating and beautifully told. The acting was superb.....everyone did a fantastic job of making it all very real. We didn't know anything about Ernie Davis and feel so privileged to know his story. Of course we knew Jim Brown, but Ernie never even had a chance to show his real talents to the world via the Cleveland Browns. What a gifted young man he was and all the difficulties he had to face made him even more special. As far as the people who don't appreciate WV being shown in that light, my husband was in the Army in 1960-1963, and whether it was WV, NC, SC, or any other state in that vicinity that is exactly how it was and he experienced that type of hate first hand. Thank you for bring us such a meaningful film. We hope it is a huge success."
Stop-Loss             ,thesar-2,0,drama,2009,4,"My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. Admittedly, I'm not a war movie buff. I can't watch 'Platoon,' 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Sure they were good movies, but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where I wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next. Following a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. Or, at least, that's the military's plan until he goes AWOL and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. No, I haven't been in any war, nor to Iraq, nor do I agree with it. I also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. I can say this: though I am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict, I can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. It's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning on their box of cigarettes and say, ""Oh, they're what? Deadly? I'll sue them"

The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,sddavis63,,animation,2008,NA,"I took my three year old daughter to the theatre to see this movie this afternoon. I've heard criticism of it for not having an explicit enough Christian theme - the Veggie Tales are, after all, a Christian outreach ministry to children. Some seem to think they've ""crossed over."" For those not familiar with that term, from a Christian point of view, a ""cross over"" is a Christian entertainer - usually a singer - who moves to the secular side of the entertainment world. Elvis Presley (from gospel singer to king of rock and roll) is probably the best known cross-over. The Veggie Tales crew probably left themselves open to that charge by doing an essentially secular Saturday cartoon for NBC. Having watched this movie, though, I think that particular criticism is unfair. It's true that Christian content isn't explicit in this movie, but it's certainly there. There are constant references to help from above; there's the king who tells the ""heroes"" that he'll always be with them; the same king looks out for widows and orphans; and there's the over-arching theme of the movie, which is that even little guys like Larry the Cucumber and Pa Grape can become big heroes, a la David and Goliath. So, if you get the analogies, you get the Christian content, much like C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia.It wasn't the content that was the problem here. The story is about 3 unlikely heroes somehow going back in time to help rescue a kidnapped princess. The title comes from a ""Silly Song by Larry"" in one of the VT videos. It's cute, a bit scary at times for wee ones and promotes good values. But the problem as I see it is that Veggie Tales was never intended for the big screen. The videos are fairly short and usually include 3 or 4 different items - stories, songs, etc. The movie essentially takes one theme and goes with it for about an hour and twenty minutes, which is probably too much for the audience of little kids that were present while I was there. I think this was a decent effort to bring the Veggie Tales sense of values to the movies, but I don't think I'd want them to do it again. 6/1"
Street Kings             ,yellocar,,misc,2008,10,"Just saw it at a sneak preview and really enjoyed it. Keanu Reeves was fantastic in this film and it really showed me what a great actor he is. I have had a hard time imagining him in anything since The Matrix, but he really pulled this character off and showed me what he is made of.The rest of the cast is solid as a rock too, but the thing that really stood out to me was the writing. This film is a throwback to the cop thrillers of the 1970's, but with MUCH better writing and bigger budgets. There are even a few genuine laughs to go with all of of the action and it is great to see Jay Mohr doing something other than ""The Ghost Whisperer!"" The audience reaction in this movie was refreshing as well. It is quite easy to get absorbed in this one.Prediction: Street Kings is the number one film on it's opening weekend. 1"
Space Chimps             ,arildmarken,,animation,2008,7,"Everyone seems to be hating this movie, and i don't really understand why? Shrek3 was a way worse movie IMO and that movie currently rates in at 6,2, and I found it horrible to watch.I do will not rate it as one of the best animation movies, but for its worth is was a short not to serious little story. Some of the jokes were prettey lame, but fun non the less.The morale is clear, its even stated when grandpa monkey turns up on the way home.Anyways, I've seen a lot of movies. A lot of em serious, with big underlying points to me made and movies you can spend a lot of time speculating about afterwords. This movie though is supposed to be enjoyed as it is :)"
Four Christmases             ,EUyeshima,1,comedy,2009,5,"This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach's ""Meet the Fockers"". Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wrote ""The Hangover""), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket rolls over the city and ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary, ""The King of Kong"", and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD, being released for the holidays, doesn't offer much in terms of extras other than two different screen formats"
WALL·E             ,benjm,0,animation,2008,9,"I join the gushing majority and say this is one amazingly done, very touching and important film. 1. A Masterpiece of Computer Graphics & Story TellingWhen computers were still in training pants 25 years ago, I studied, worked with and taught computer graphics. I've often watched an animated film (or live film with injected animation) with knowing appreciation at some use of or advance in computer graphics technology. I have a friend who had been involved managing computer graphics projects for some of the previous Star Wars movies. We have previously discussed the ""state of the art"" and where it's going. The surprise to me in this film wasn't that they could do graphics of this quality now. It was amazement at the scope, effort, skill and creative genius I know it takes to make something so beautiful and moving.Watching the film, my feelings went from astonishment at the graphics to deep empathy and feeling for the main characters. The people around me gasped and say ""wow"" just the same. You don't need experience or friends like mine to tell you that nothing else has come this close to looking so real and gorgeous, to feel so visceral and well-crafted. The use of modern live-action cinematic effects is stunning beyond words. The film's reliance on the intelligence of children and adults to understand the serious thoughts and complex emotions being conveyed, well, is just simply an amazing and reassuring experience. And I thought the closing credit art (using different styles of famous artists) was very cool too.2. Some Small Nitpicks: Most of the time I felt I was watching an exceptionally crafted film with a tight story and a serious message about the current problems of and future prospects for Earth. An then something would happen in the film that would be, like, ""Huh? That doesn't quite make sense or follow, but it's just animation"". I found 2-3 moments where I was shifted from sobering reality to forgivable fantasy, and it was a bit jarring and distracting But these moments can be easily forgotten with the continuation of the next amazing scene.It looks like the quality (time, money, computer horse-power)spent on the main characters is much more than what was spent on depicting the humans. Heck, even the garbage get's more realistic treatment than the people. And then there is the live video of Scott Willard as the ""Executive in Chief"" talking to the planet....The styles don't mesh well for me. I appreciate the thought-line that the humans look more cartoon because of the surreal and clueless nature of their existence on the ship, as well as our inept and greedy custodianship of the planet. I can imagine that the live video is meant to help connect children with the cartoon-nature of certain government officials and the patronizing policies they always on display these days on the evening news. Maybe this is all true, but it's probably also a way to rationalize a limited budget and time schedule. The bottom-line for me that the discrepancies between the treatments didn't work that well for me.Most of the time the characters are so extremely cute and lovable, it's a complement to their creators. But sometimes the cultural cliché's and visual slapstick are a bit much. Overall, it all adds up to a very sweet and moving film, but just a little less ""shtick"" would have been fine by me.Some thoughts on other reviews I've read here:Is the Message Too Heavy-Handed? I don't think so. It's mainly aimed at small kids. They get it, and they take it to heart. Maybe the question should be ""is the message loud enough?"" We earthlings still don't seem to be getting the message. Last I checked, we were still busy polluting the air, water, soil and every life form on the planet...oh, and ruining our climate also. We are feeding our families and enjoying ourselves, but sorry we are each helping to destroy the planet along the way. ""Oh well. It's not like I can make a difference"". Let's just leave the problem for the kids. Good luck kids! Do you think mom and dad are making ""good choices?""It's a moment of truth for us. Are we up to it? Are we truly awake yet and smelling the rising levels of toxicity in our environment? Maybe the message was said softer people would get it more?Regarding those people who have posted negatively, that they couldn't connect, and even thought of walking out...everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion and to state it. But, gosh, If this film didn't make them gasp at beauty, smile warmly, laugh knowingly...if it didn't put a lump in your throat or make an eye or two teary, then...that's just sad, and even a bit scary.If you haven't seen this film yet, run and see it on the big screen while you can. I think you will enjoy taking some kids. You will see them enthralled and fully-attuned to the message. It's a good thing"

And of course having Jolie in it she didn't have to twist my arm to much. We had to go out of town to see it because our local theater wasn't showing it. The acting by Jolie was great. Eastwood's direction was great. And the 20's and 30's look to the movie was so realistic. I learned some things about this time frame by watching this movie. So not only did I enjoy the movie I learned a little bit along the way. This is a Rated R movie so I wouldn't take kids to it because there are a couple disturbing moments in the movie. If this movie doesn't get some Oscar nominations I will be very surprised. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! 1
WALL·E             ,jedi-jones,0,animation,2008,10,"Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.Footnote: The pre-movie short is an awesome, violent Looney Tunes/Roger Rabbit-esquire toon. It wants only to entertain and does. 4"
The Escapist             ,ssneg,,crime,2009,9,"Most people who did not like this movie mention such epithets as ""confusing"", ""unclear"", ""mixed up"" and ""hard to work out"". The story is indeed delivered in a non-trivial bi-linear way, so it takes some focusing on the movie and some brain activity. You see why this movie has not pleased the wide audience, right? Maybe some of the haters should stick with their comic books.""The Escapist"" is a brilliant movie per se and a star among other escape-this-prison movies (and TV series if you know what I mean). The cast is great, Sir Brian Cox is unbelievable, Joseph Fiennes delivers a great performance, and the rest of the cast are near flawless. I would have given this movie 10/10 if Damian Lewis was not in it. Don't get me wrong, he is a great actor, one of my most favourite after Band of Brothers, and I enjoyed his other movies a lot.. Yet he is definitely miscast in this case and the whole idea of having a really wicked person with a face of a good guy did not fly for me. Lewis is much more convincing in ""Life"" (during his ""what I learned behind bars"" moments) than here.Again, this is a gem and I am glad I have watched it"
Gomorrah             ,jc811,,crime,2009,2,"Talk about flimsy story lines. We watched for 2 hrs and asked ourselves, ""What is going on?"". The multiple plots were a trainwreck trying to keep up with. Yea, it shows the gritty side of Italy. Yea, it features some criminals. But it seemed to me that it was just filming the characters delivering food, making dresses (one is a dressmaker), and delivering money. There was a (boring) subplot about illegal dumping of waste. The one story that was slightly interesting was the two wannabe gangsters.Unless you like movies just for the fact that it is set in Italy, avoid this nonsensical bore fest."
Julia             ,secondtake,1,crime,2010,9,"Julia (2008)A hard edged tale of a woman pushed by her own desperation into crimes over her head. Tilda Swinton lets it rip here, in a vivid, color, cinema-verite style that depends as much on making you uneasy as anything. The characters are so believable, and the sequence of events stumbles along with such perfect inelegance (to say the least), you hate to see it all because what happens is pretty awful. The ground covered is a believable version of what an ordinary person with seemingly good moral structure is driven to by circumstance. In this case, it's about being pushed by her own sorry life to do something that breaks out of it. But it also begins as a curious compassion, a genuine skepticism overwhelmed by the possibilities. By thinking, why not? And of course, why not then becomes all too clear. It's this sense that it could by a stretch happen to you or me (hopefully not, but in theory) that gives the movie its chilling penetration.And the ending, as sensational as it gets, is a logical outcome of where we began, and there is a kind of victory, but it's no Hollywood ending, and that's a huge relief. Rather, it's as if you went along with a woman for the adventure of her life and it's the real thing, nothing held back, including disbelief, fear, violence, and sometimes, thankfully, a glimmer of hope. Very very well made--acting, writing, filming--but not everyone's cup of tea because it is so unsettling."
The Brothers Bloom             ,KineticSeoul,1,action,2010,8,"I really liked the visual style of this movie and how it doesn't take itself seriously in a good way. It's a bright con film about two brothers that are good at what they do since a very young age, but the younger brother wants out. So his older brother convinces him to join him for one last con, with his assistant Bang Bang which fits her quite accurately. This isn't a serious or one of those dark movies about a con, so in another words it will leave a smile on your face. Plus I sort of cared what happens to the characters since they are mostly likable and has charisma, and found the scenario especially the visual style of this movie to be intriguing. It has a bit of the bromance, but mostly it's a romantic comedy with smugglers and should not be taken seriously in a good way of course. This movie really does have heart and a sense of adventure. Now I enjoyed Rian Johnson's past film ""Brick"" and I enjoyed this one as well, not as cool as ""Brick"" is, but still enjoyable. Especially how the main con, needs some fake cons to go with it along with it's witty plot. It isn't a waste of time or money to see this film. By the end of the film, with it's great ending I have to give this a...8.2/10"
Frost/Nixon             ,dataconflossmoor-1,0,misc,2009,10,"This film focused on the infamous Watergate break in of the Democratic National Committee during the summer of 1972!! As it turned out, the whole Watergate fiasco wound up being, much to the revelation of the American people, something which the Nixon administration was peccant for. When the Watergate incident hit the media, the principle bone of contention was that television was after showmanship, and that the major deception with T.V. was that the news anchors merely simplified disaster. When an onslaught of scandalous theatrics occurred with the Nixon White House, such culpability on the Nixon Administration's behalf was labeled as illicit and nefarious! These actions that the Nixon Administration engaged in were a total exploitation of executive power. Nixon and his cabinet were initially nonchalant about Watergate, eventually, as trouble with the Watergate break-in began to escalate, the Nixon Administration responded accordingly. At best, Richard Nixon and key aids of his expected no higher than a grade of a D- for political containment. When the final verdict of a resounding red F was issued to the Nixon White House for their reprehensible breach of trust with the American people, impeachment proceedings began immediately. The intransigence with the U.S. voters about the Watergate break in resulted in Nixon having to resign from his post as President of the United States. This is something no other President was ever forced to do in the history of our nation. As a result, Richard Nixon acquired a peptic ulcer. The resonating aftermath with the American people was one whereby they wound up delving in dirges of shame and self righteous indignation for a protracted period of time, and the rest, as they say, is history!!. For David Frost, however, this was merely the beginning of his bloodthirsty agenda!! The Watergate scandal was perceived as an instance of espionage, and political corruption that the United States citizens were totally ashamed of. The Watergate affair was perceived by David Frost as a potential for a pique in publicity and soaring ratings for his talk show career. What was identified as pejorative for the American public's codes of decency, became an auspicious endeavor for nationwide television notoriety!! Complications with the Richard Nixon interview were dealt with in an insidiously successful manner. These were the ground rules, simply circumvent the BBC, and, as far as sponsors were concerned; SO WHAT!! Oldsmobile and Honeywell will not sponsor this event, but Alpo Dog Food will!! Bottom line: The show must,and will go on!! Once the interview with David Frost and Richard Nixon commenced, Nixon enjoyed a preliminary advantage. Richard Nixon was very elusive, as a result, he was perpetually caricatured as well as extremely underestimated in terms of his knowledge of the prevailing political arena!! Both Frost and Nixon shared the unnerving proclivity of being afflicted by compulsive behavior. It was the final interview which opened up an ideological metamorphosis pertaining to the purpose of this entire string of interviews. David Frost's intrepid disposition during this interview now made Richard Nixon (the private citizen) capitulate to a heinous admission of guilt yet another time, thus making Nixon the fall guy once again!! The entire string of Frost/Nixon interviews was initially perceived as an ersatz replacement for other ideas such as a banal discussion about male menopause with some Columbia chancellors. Ultimately, these Frost/ Nixon interviews became transformed into a harsh exposure of the myriad of character discrepancies which lurked in the Oval Office while Richard Nixon was President!! This final interview with Nixon was the pinnacle of David Frost's days as a talk show host. This long dissertation about this entire affair was what the movie ""Frost/Nixon"" centered around. So, how was such a disgraceful event in American history depicted by the producers, writers, directors, and actresses and actors in the movie? The answer is; brilliantly!! The visceral portrayal of the seventies went into relentless detail, particularly with regard to the abhorrent facade in fashion which the seventies possessed!! The accentuated diamonds on Richard Nixon's ties was conspicuously deliberate. The Neanderthal mops, which the seventies referred to as hair styles, were unfortunately realistic!! As far as the suits are concerned!! Put it this way ""I can't hear you with that sport jacket you're wearing!!"" Surprisingly enough, the film ""Frost/Nixon"" was directed by Ronny Howard. This is surprising because Ronny Howard (via his role as Oppie Taylor) comes across as the twentieth century version of Hucleberry Finn. The screen writing of William Perry was excellent! As far as the acting goes, Michael Sheen was so believable as David Frost that he got the part of Frost in less than ten minutes. Oliver Platt did a remarkable job in this movie!! Kevin Bacon was excellent as Jack Brennan. the shunned general, I always thought that having disdain for soldiers who fought in Vietnam was a very convoluted line of logic anyway!! Frank Langella (Who was brilliant as William Paley in ""Good Night and Good Luck"") was simply spectacular as Richard Nixon in this film!! Frank Langella seemed to have a very cogent recognition of Nixon's dubiously painful plight!! Langella's agitated responses invoked a very genuine temerity and insolence, this is a very authentic rendition of Richard Nixon's attitudes!! Movies such as these cannot be noted for original dialog, as they are merely paraphrasing the actual events which occurred. It is about how powerful the delivery on these events is. I feel that this film delivered these ominous events with the Nixon Presidency in an absolutely flawless manner. The challenging approach with the film ""Frost/Nixon"" puts this movie in a category by itself. The itemization concerning the Nixon Cabinet's penchant for volatility was graphically prolific. The correlation to dire circumstances involving doom and despair with the movie ""Frost/Nixon"" were extremely gripping!! The directing, screenplay writing, and acting in this movie is emphatically first rate, I definitely recommend seeing this film!! Tremendous films such as ""Frost/Nixon"" raise the bar on an intensified intellectual awareness in the cinema today!! FIVE STARS! NO QUESTION ABOUT IT"
The Reader             ,Buddy-51,1,drama,2009,9,"Like all works of art that endeavor to ""illuminate"" the Holocaust, ""The Reader"" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all ""means.""Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the story proper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name of Michael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old woman named Hanna Schmitz. For a summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the woman introduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocates by reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking. Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student, discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant so much to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guard currently standing trial for war crimes. The story goes even further ahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship by sending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves out her time in prison.There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims to cast a Nazi mass murderer in a ""sympathetic"" light. Yet, what ultimately comes across in the story is not how ""likable"" a person Hanna is but how sadly tragic. Like all fine drama, ""The Reader"" goes beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains to examine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of the human condition. The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout. Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between our attraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at the difference in their ages. Hanna is particularly enigmatic as she embraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strange fulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of their relationship. Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feel for what brings these two very different characters together at this particular moment in time.As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornier issues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle of the Twentieth Century, questioning how so many ""average"" people could, at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occurring, and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the mass atrocities. There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young law student confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has been able to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did not do everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. In that brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have been like for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when so many, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in an effort to move on with their lives.Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as he ages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, must come to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on the most intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer. Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, and it takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with the moral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966, and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter. Both are superb, with Kross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy and sensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennes is called on to do later in the film. And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role that won her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen's great actresses.Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted Bernhard Schlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and to director Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and Roger Deakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film. Together, these fine artists have created a work that challenges the intellect and roils the emotions."
Nights in Rodanthe             ,baumer,1,drama,2008,8,"Discovering something, the journey is so much more fun, so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel energized, invigorated and alive. You simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused. Love, and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it, is pure bliss. Where it goes from here is anyone's guess, but when you first begin your journey together, nothing can compare to it.Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals. In this film, they are about to embark on that mystical journey together, where love, and the discovery of the emotions along the way, will help save them.Lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him. As hurt as she was by him, as much as she really dislikes him, there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back. Why you might ask? Because in life, and love, sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence. Yes, this man cheated on her but she has kids with him, she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him.Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father. He also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic. He is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue. This is what brings him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer told him not to, he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in Rodanthe. He stays at the Inn that Adrienne is taking care of. Soon, they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life.By now this sounds like a simple idea for a film, and although it might be something you've seen or read about before, Gere and Lane simply own the film. Diane Lane lights the screen up with her smile. Her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching. Gere's character is a little different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell. He blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient. On the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault, and that she was a 1 in 50,000 casualty. But deep down, it eats away at him. They find each other at a time when both need someone to listen.Gere and Lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers. They were married in Unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would love to see more films with them together. In fact, I'd love to see more films with Diane Lane but that's a story for another time.Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. They both become better people, they both become stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. This is a film about redemption, absolution, and second chances.It will also ask you to bring some hankies.8/"
The Escapist             ,sundevil27,,crime,2008,8,"Seen at Sundance Premiere 2008. Within the first 2 minutes of the Escapist you know your buckled in and you won't be getting up till the credits start rolling, and thats just how it is. In the tradition of the Bird Man of Alcatraz, Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke and other greats of the prison break genre you can add the Escapist. The feel is modern but the setup is old school and true to the genre in a familiarly comforting way. Director Rupert Wyatt has created a fantastic action film with intelligent sequencing and a meaningful ending that makes you remember its indie roots. What is even more amazing though is the (((sound))) , it is insane! The sounds of the prison are so real and chilling in their quiet way, then when the action hits its like a tidal wave of sound hitting all you senses. Rarely does a new flick come along with such wide potential that brings new ideas and old ones together so well. I'm left extremely impressed by all involved. Movie will be best seen on the big screen with high quality sound, I imagine American audiences will not show this as much love as they should do to the lack of big names but I suspect the UK will embrace this very well.

Kung Fu Panda             ,Ericwenzhe,0,animation,2008,10,"I can't exactly describe my feelings when I first saw this movie yesterday. It's awesome. The dreamworks has done really a good job in expressing Chinese cultural elements! It made me and my friends and all the audience laughed from the beginning to the end. When the movie came to its end, 90% of the audience didn't leave the room as usual. They stayed until the HP picture came out! Every scene is so precious and lovely that everyone didn't want to miss it! As a Chinese citizen, my feelings are complicated when I saw that the culture are so nicely expressed on screen by some foreign movie makers, but it's good, isn't it? Chinese movie makers should learn a lot from Hollywood.I think Kung Fu Panda perfectly gets together several important Chinese cultural elements: traditional Chinese Kung Fu Tactics, traditional Chinese fighting story, traditional Chinese jokes, traditional Chinese scenes, traditional Chinese music, even traditional Chinese legends! I also like the song after the movie.Thank you, Dreamworks!! I'm seriously considering to go to see it for the third time!"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,RebeccaWood,0,misc,2008,6,"I would write about the plot here, but seeing how there isn't really one, I find that pointless. This movie is basically about one thing: Awesome dancing. If you walked into this movie expecting anything else, then you walked out severely disappointed. I, thankfully, expected this movie to be a strenuous two-hour music video, and, it having gone above and beyond my expectations, walked out completely satisfied (in fact, I saw it twice). Step Up 2 presented some of the most amazing street dancing sequences that have ever appeared on film. The final dance literally had me leaning forward in my seat, as if I were watching a high-intensity fight or chase scene. And come on. I've heard a lot of complaints about the acting. I thought the acting was not too bad, especially since they initially had to find really good dancers...that happened to act. Comparably speaking, I wouldn't say it was any worse than, say,the acting in Jumper, which was fairly horrendous at times *cough*Jamie Bell and Hayden Christenson. Basic summary:Highlights: The video that the new crew makes for the streets. The characters Moose and that hilarious Asian chick. Latino dance scene And, of course, the final dance scene.I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because this is a film quality grade, and, as a film, it wasn't spectacular. However, Step Up 2 accomplished just what it intended to do: create an awesome excuse to show off amazing dance moves for almost two hours. In fact, it passed with flying color"
Lakeview Terrace             ,Negative_Reviews,0,crime,2008,7,"There's an inherent problem with making a movie of this kind: unless you're a creative genius of your time, these sorts of movies have the potential to turn real generic, REAL fast. Reminiscent of Denzel Washington from Training Day, we see Samuel L. Jackson play an overly aggressive cop with an agenda, with the movie focusing on the problems he's causing for his new neighbors. A completely realistic situation that can take place anywhere. Problem is, because a movie like this is completely character driven, after you have the nice slow build up to the climax, once the tension snaps, you're relegated to basically a generically default final act of the movie where ""the bad guy finally comes out of the proverbial shadows and literally chases the hero."" (i.e. Disturbia, The Glass House). It's a shame too because the buildup on this was very good. Samuel L. Jackson was really scary here, he played that bullying, obsessive character perfect. The only acting problems I saw were 2-3 moments from Kerry Washington where her sad face was done poorly, with overly done lip quivers and facial movements (similar to Kirsten Dunst's crying scenes from the Spider-Man movies, except done in a BAD way).With a movie like this, you pretty much have these possible outcomes: 1) the generic, semi-predictable ending (like we got here). 2) tragic ending with hero dying at the end. 3) an unpredictable twist coming out of left field (this has the potential to be very good or very bad). 4) a Great ending.Unfortunately we usually get number one, since they wanna give the satisfying, safe, effective, tried and true, Hollywood ending. Most people are content with those types of cop out endings. I'm not."
Trucker             ,cadfile,1,drama,2010,NA,"I had the opportunity to see ""Trucker"" the other day and I loved the flick. The cast did a great job and the look and lighting of the film added to the tone.Michelle Monaghan plays Diane Ford, a long haul truck driver, who has her carefree and relationship free life style upended when a medical emergency forces her to take in the child she abandoned 11 years before. Peter's father, played by Benjamin Bratt, is sick with cancer and his girlfriend Jenny, played by the great Joey Lauren Adams is stuck with other obligations and has to leave the kid with Diane. Peter, played by Jimmy Bennett, is just as cross as his mother at the situation. The film deals mainly with Diane and Peter reconnecting and the change that happens in both their lives.Monaghan kills the part of Diane. She walks fast, talks fast, drives fast, and drinks hard. She refuses to let anyone get close to her including her best friend Runner, played by Nathan Fillion.In the days after Peter shows up you can see Diane struggling with it. It seems to bring back the memories from the time the kid was born and all the baggage she ran out on but she can't run away this time.Both Diane and Peter feel their away around each other since they don't know one another that well. We do see some sparks of maternal feelings from Diane and the kid begins to soften in his anger toward his mom.What got me was seeing Diane's raw emotions at times in her eyes. Kudos' to Monaghan for bring that out in the character. And her character arc is not cliché' or predictable in the least. The film kept my interest for the whole 90 minute running time.I don't get to see to many great female characters in many films but it was great to have the opportunity to see Diane and get a taste of her long journey."
Iron Man             ,DonJohn80,0,action,2008,9,"Quite possibly the best comic movie ever, hovering around the level of the first Spider-Man (before Raimi lost his mind). Robert Downey Jr was as perfect a casting job as we've been expecting, Bridges plays Obidiah Stane that you won't even think of him as The Dude, the CG doesn't suck,and it doesn't try to cram too much...(read more) in (the runtime of just over two hours feels just right). Any worries I had about this film went right out the window, and they'll stay out the window when I go again... and again... and again. Just remember to stick through the credits, because if you know anything about Marvel (and even if you don't) you'll find the wait worth i"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,DarthVoorhees,0,action,2008,9,"I hardly ever have revelations or opinions about a movie until I see it through and reach the end. I found myself dissecting this movie while I was watching it, and I didn't really know why. Raiders was one of the first movies I remember seeing and loving and I desperately wanted Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be something really special. Well mid way through the film I decided I was disappointed with this movie. Here I was going to a midnight show for one of my boyhood heroes and I was treated to another lackluster David Koepp script. The story didn't make much sense, the Russians were predictable villains, and Indy surviving a nuclear blast...Then before I decided I hated it, I thought to myself about what Indiana Jones was really supposed to be, the modern day Buck Rogers serial brought to life. When you think hard none of the other Indiana Jones films had overly outstanding dialogue or stories that made you think. What made the other Indiana Jones films great was the execution of the material and Crystal Skull is able to succeed in this regard as well. I liked Raiders and Last Crusade a great deal because Indy was looking for biblical larger than life artifacts, and I had some trouble digesting the notion of extra terrestrials but not too much trouble because Spielberg is very careful to make sure that the aliens are not presented in an overly over the top way. They are very similar to his aliens from Close Encounters in the fact that they mean peace and try to bring advancement to the civilians.I was a little hesitant towards the idea of having the Soviets as villains. I just thought it was too predictable after using the Nazis twice and because the Soviets really didn't represent the mythical evil that the Nazis did. However Spielberg does touch upon something clever in the beginning of the film, Indy is fired from his university and during a high speed motorcycle chase they pass through anti-soviet propaganda. The idea of having Irina Spalko see only a weapon out of the artifacts skims across the surface of some commentary. I kind of wished they would have played more with that but then again Indiana Jones has never truly been a political commentary, even when he was fighting the Nazis it wasn't, and Spielberg is passionate about spreading Holocaust awareness. Steve if your reading this a Cold War film isn't a bad idea...Film goers rest assured, Harrison Ford fits back into the fedora like he never took it off. He is Indy and that is really the only fair way to describe it. This is probably the one character in film lure that I would only want one actor playing. The catch phrases still have bite and that trademark adventurous and bold attitude is still very much alive in Dr. Jones. However Indy has grown a lot between films. Spielberg shows Indy has been through some changes and we get a feel of what he has been up to in his twenty year absence. I wanted to know what happened to Indy, I just didn't want him to show up with no explanation. We get glimpses into his time during WWII and his on-off again relationship with Marion Ravenwood(""Huge Spoiler"" Shia Labeouf is the new Junior). Brining back Marion was a smart move in my opinion. It'd be far too easy to just throw him another girlfriend to make love to and toss away like James Bond but bringing back Marion proves that Indy is a human as well as a superhero.The special effects were decent but they were also cartoon at times. Spielberg tries very hard to use the authentic stunt work that made us love the action scenes in the other Indy films but he also wants to mix in CGI. I would rather he stick with one course of story telling over the other because mixing them made some of the scenes appear silly and it lead to choppy transitions. By no means is this a huge problem but it is noticeable.The grown-up brain in me probably doesn't want to recommend this film but my heart and my inner child were swept away by John William's Raiders March again..."
Street Kings             ,DICK STEEL,,misc,2008,9,"So I continue my foray into the theatrical releases this week as a break from the Festival proceedings, and choosing Street Kings is a no brainer. It was in Speed that Keanu Reeves donned a Kevlar vest and a devil may care attitude to save a speeding bus from annihilation, and after that he's gone on to other blockbusters such as the Matrix trilogy and countless of other romance movies. Here, he revisits that action genre as a cop with questionable morals, and while some may gripe over his acting ability, I thought that he was given a role totally within his range - that of a clueless gunslinger who's caught up in a web of intrigue far greater than he can fathom.Based on a story James Ellroy, who gave us L.A. Confidential and Black Dahlia, we continue the tale about corrupt cop culture, and with director David Ayer at the helm, who delivered Harsh Times and wrote Training Day, there's some amount of credibility and expectation with these two powerhouses collaborating, and from my previous enjoyment of their earlier movies, thankfully, Street Kings delivered spot on, with hard hitting, uncompromising action coupled with violence without remorse, and a deep undercurrent brewing on the political angle within the police department as well.We get introduced to Reeves' Detective Tom Ludlow of the LAPD, who in the first 10 minutes, we witness a classic Dirty Harry styled cop who lets his guns do the talking, and employs questionable tactics in getting the job done. And he gets off the hook easy because of his sterling reputation, and no doubt being given special treatment and protection from his direct boss Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker). Naturally it gets slowly revealed that the entire police team has plenty of skeletons in the closet, and while Wander may be the patriarch of the force, politicking his way to more power, he has his enforcer, Ludlow, at his side to straighten things up.And with corrupt cops come the probe by Internal Affairs, and here's where things start to get interesting, with potential moles, and doubtful loyalties being thrown around, and in the midst of it all is severe corruption, that it's nearly impossible to try and trust anyone around, more so when Chris Evan's Detective Paul Diskant gets thrown into the fray to investigate a case against Ludlow. For those who enjoy cop dramas, you'll be in for a real treat with the twists and turns, betrayals and double crossings, and when it comes down to the crunch, out comes the guns.But more importantly, it allows us to question just how much are we willing to sacrifice our moral ground, especially when revealing the truth will put us in bad light, or get us into trouble, and we're talking about trouble with a capital T, where innate self-preservation instincts will take over if we do not consciously make a conscientious decision to come clean. We can cover up, get people to cover up, or better yet, have someone in power to cover it up for you, but that only means you get sucked into a system, and it will continue to breed within you, for the worse.Street Kings is excellent stuff that blew me away (caution: Fan Boy mode is on), and the ending sure is one of a kind, with the usual soliloquy, but one that really made you think on both sides of the equation - what one would do and say in order to save oneself, and how one can lie straight into the eye of another. It's classic black eat black, showing how deep the rot has permeated, and the ending just demonstrates that sometimes unorthodox methods work, but with a caution that there are always more powerful people out there who play others like pawns on a chessboard. Besides, it was nice to see Forest Whitaker getting into the rough and tumble of things after a rather docile role in Vantage Point."
Milk             ,Chris_Docker,0,misc,2008,9,"I very nearly gave this movie a miss. I'm pleased I didn't.As with the gay-themed Brokeback Mountain, many might have stayed away till they realised it was more of a movie than that. Milk is a biopic of the murdered gay rights activist, Harvey Milk. But it connects to the audience by being symbolically about everyone, every minority, anybody who has ever been bullied or ashamed to admit their beliefs. It's about the human spirit. The rights of man enshrined in the American Constitution. And it's about the compassion that lets us see our enemies as human beings.Part of this is down to an outstanding script. But much is down to Sean Penn (at times almost unrecognisable in a beard), who handles the role with a winning combination of grit and sensitivity. He becomes the master orator standing for political office. There are characters in his life that have committed suicide because of the shame of being gay. He is the first openly gay man to hold public office and he gives people hope (in much the same way, it may be said, that the similarly charismatic Barak Obama is doing for black people). We see poignant comparisons with Nazi pogroms against anyone who was 'different'. We see the fervent religious right, claiming God on their side, as they preach a message of hate.Righteous hatred is not dead in America. A few hours before seeing Milk, I had watched a horrific documentary about a family of preachers who picket not only 'faggots' but anyone they believe tacitly supports homosexuality (the footage included picketing a dead serviceman's funeral). We have laws against inciting racial hatred. How can they get away with inciting such homophobia? Milk goes back to the 70's. Politicians opposing him label homosexuals with prostitutes and thieves. Deny them any rights. An argument worth pursuing philosophically perhaps, especially as Gordon Brown's UK government is currently trying to demonise prostitution. A thief breaks the laws of property. But homosexuals <U+0096> and prostitutes for that matter <U+0096> offend only those whose totalitarian view of the world wish to discriminate against those who, privately and without hurting others, have the audacity to live differently. Common tactics include linking crime by association. And with prostitution there is some evidence of links to crime, although it may be linked more to marginalisation <U+0096> and prostitutes could always, at least theoretically, become non-prostitutes. Homosexuality, like being black or Jewish, cannot be 'treated.' Gays can rarely, if ever, 'become straight.' And neither is sexual preference an indicator of criminal tendency.Milk takes his arguments to the most hostile of audiences. He debates with remarkable skill. But, although people warm to him for his courage and kindness, his personal life frequently sinks into tatters. Being second fiddle to a political crusader is no joyride. Even if you were straight. Campaign-trail Harvey might be fighting for your life in broad terms, but it won't help you through that long night of dinners for one.Milk admirably avoids the mistake of glossing over common faults of the gay community <U+0096> notably male aversion (at the time) to lesbians. In a hilarious scene where Harvey hires a lesbian campaign manager, the all-male entourage dissolves into ridiculous girly twittering against her <U+0096> until, with a few well-chosen words, she proves she's got, 'bigger balls than anyone in the room'. Harvey slowly expands his cause. He realises it can't be just about gay rights. It has to be about everyone's rights. If elected, he has to show genuine concern for everyone's troubles <U+0096> not just gays. And, after a few political near-slips where he is tempted to cut a deal, he welds himself to a virtuousness in public office that his opponents can only hypocritically claim but not deliver.We know in the first few moments that he is going to die. The rest of the film is told in flashback. Penn, an actor that is occasionally too intense for my liking, has found a film where he can throw every muscle twitch, every watery eye, every shade of emotion, into a character and cause where intensity is called for. In one of the finest performances of his career, he is understated to convey finer feeling, yet passionate on the soap box to an inspirational degree.I was also very pleased to see this praiseworthy development from director Gus Van Sant. Many 'indie' directors start off with great 'artistic' work, only to be eaten up by Hollywood glitz. Van Sant's career is almost the opposite. Having proved his metal with crowd-pleasers like To Die For and Good Will Hunting, he seems gradually to have abandoned all pretensions to mainstream. His Paranoid Park was a masterstroke of subtle evocation in the thriller genre. With Milk, he has applied his skills like a great craftsman, reclaiming self-respect for the serious yet accessible artist.The one nagging criticism of course is, where are all the gay actors? I cannot fault Sean Penn's acting. He is undoubtedly the best actor for the part. But the very message of equality proclaimed so loudly by Hollywood's darling liberal left is still unheeded within their own industry. How many openly gay actors can you name? I thought so . . . And how far have we really got, really, or has apathy set in? As California bans gay marriage, one commentator noted, ""Where were today's Harvey Milks when Proposition 8 was on the ballot?"""
Righteous Kill             ,Turfseer,0,crime,2008,4,"'Righteous Kill' represents a big foot forward for screenwriter Russell Gewirtz whose rookie effort, 'Inside Man', was a story about a bank heist that had little credibility. The plot of 'Righteous Kill', however, is modestly clever. A vigilante serial killer is on the loose in New York City, murdering various criminals. His calling card is a rhymed poem left at each crime scene. De Niro (Turk) and Pacino (Rooster) play the two aging detectives assigned to solve the case. De Niro is seen throughout on a surveillance tape seemingly 'confessing' to committing the murders. But in a twist at the end of the story, his confession turns out to be forced and it ends up that Pacino is actually the murderer all along.Before arriving at the film's climax, we learn that Turk planted evidence on a murderer who got off on a technicality and as a result the criminal is sent off to jail. A good part of the movie chronicles how each of the bad guys are dispatched by the vigilante. The main bad guy is a drug dealer played by 50 Cent who is convincingly menacing. An early unconvincing scene involves Turk and Rooster sending a pretty coke-addicted lawyer to the drug dealer's lair, wearing a wire, and trying to entrap him. The drug dealer sees through the ruse right away and the lawyer is shot by the drug dealer's bodyguard (but eventually survives). Why veteran detectives would place an amateur informant in such easy jeopardy doesn't ring true. There's a subplot involving a sexy Crime Scene Investigator who is simultaneously bedding Turk and Perez, a younger detective (played by John Leguizamo). Perez and his partner Riley (played by Donnie Wahlberg) come to the conclusion that it's one of their own who has been committing the murders. Various posters here have pointed to deficiencies in the script including that De Niro and Pacino are too old for their parts, there's a lack of character development (too many good cop/bad cop clichés), a lack of suspense and scenes that are repetitious. One poster suggested that the characters needed to have a softer side but I think it was the director's intent to keep the entire story as dark as possible. The constant use of the moody soundtrack throughout most of the film compensated for the lack of emotional depth of the characters. Was this a good thing? I don't know. But clearly the music added to the film's 'neo-noir' feel. 'Righteous Kill' will probably do fairly well at the box office if one factors in the potential global market. This is really a noir version of 'Dirty Harry' and those who love having their stick-figure bad guys brought to justice without putting up a fight, will be drawn to his type of film. And then there's De Niro and Pacino. De Niro almost always channels the same character--a hot-headed gangster type (I was so much reminded of his performance in 'Analyze This', although that's a comedy). Moviegoers always want to pay money to see De Niro even though he usually coughs up the same shtick. Pacino however is much more subdued in this film until the end. Only then does he allow his over the top persona to come out. Actually that was the intent of the screenwriter; the audience is led to believe that De Niro is the hot head and Pacino is the reasonable one. Pacino keeps De Niro ""in check' throughout the film until the ending. Although many claimed they 'figured out' the twist ending 30 minutes into the film, I must confess that I didn't see it coming. But once it was revealed I didn't really buy the reversal since it was inconsistent with the way the character arc had developed. Pacino's 'Rooster' has noble motives for offing the bad guys. But suddenly, when the sexy CSI gal is about to expose him, he viciously attacks her. It just seemed totally out of character for this noble 'Dirty Harry' character to suddenly decompensate and attack a woman. What 'noble' criminal would do such a thing? Rooster's explanation is that he became disappointed with Turk after Turk planted evidence on the murderer who got off on a technicality. He had 'looked up' to Turk but now the image of him being a noble cop had been destroyed. Somehow he now becomes a vigilante serial killer because his partner no longer 'went by the book'. This is his explanation as to why he becomes unhinged which leads his partner of 30 years to shoot him to death. If you believe in this motive, then you'll believe that the portrait of the New York City Police Department as depicted in this film is a realistic one. When all is said and done, we never get a feel for Turk and Rooster as flesh and blood human beings. There is little 'back story' to 'Righteous Kill' and that applies to all the characters. 'Righteous Kill"" remains a modestly entertaining detective mystery with little character development and chiefly relying on the hit or miss semi-comic banter between two aging Hollywood legend"
Frozen River             ,zetes,1,crime,2008,5,"Stereotypical indie from the sucks-to-be-poor subgenre. Hope I'm not being too glib. It does suck to be poor. I'm nowhere near wealthy myself, and I grew up with a mother under similar circumstances to the protagonist of this film (a little smarter, though; at least she realized that she was eligible for food stamps). I have more than just sympathy for her and people like her. But I am still suspicious of movies like this that lay it on so thick and seem to delight in jerking the audience's emotions around. The story follows a middle-aged woman (Melissa Leo) trying desperately to get by on her meager, part-time wages. Her husband is a thief and gambler, and has stolen the little money she has saved up to buy herself and her two sons a bigger trailer. Up the creek without a paddle, Leo meets up with a Mohawk woman from the nearby reservation (Misty Upham) who introduces her to the lucrative world of smuggling illegal immigrants across the Canadian border. First-time director and screenwriter Courtney Hunt seems to be following some kind of indie film-making book, because she makes sure to hit all the cliché bits. Everything is very predictable; everything that happens in the movie happens for a reason. For instance, every time a radio is on, the weather is reported, which will come back later in the story. The dots are all connected, and there's no room for character or mood building. The tone is pitched at that quiet, supposedly subtle level that so many indies are. The sequence that summarizes the movie is the one where Leo throws a duffel bag out the window of her car on the titular frozen river on a night that the radio, of course, tells us is going to be far below zero, because she's afraid that the Pakistani couple in her trunk might be terrorists. It turns out that their baby was in the bag. Horrible, right? Well, Leo's reaction is, ""Well, we'll just have to go back and get it."" She's so nonchalant about it, I was sure I must have mistakenly heard ""baby"". It turns out to be dead. Later, after one of the dozen or so contrivances that drive the film, the baby comes back to life in an apparent miracle. No reaction, at least from Leo. The event ends up changing Upham's outlook on life, but there's no grandiose reaction from her, either. The point is, anyway, that Hunt uses these silly, melodramatic situations which are completely unsubtle, and then she insists with her film-making that her movie is, in fact, subtle. I do have to admit that both Leo and Upham are decent actresses in the movie. I don't think either are award-worthy. It doesn't help that Leo's character often seems so profoundly stupid that it would be easy enough for a privileged audience to dismiss her with, ""Well, someone like her deserves to be poor!"" I like the attempt Hunt makes in exploring the subtle (and occasionally overt) racism of the white people in the film, but sometimes it feels like she wrote the script without any of it, and someone who read it suggested she add it to give it some more depth. Honestly, if she made it her focus and not just the sideline to the sucks-to-be-poor material, Frozen River would have been a more vital movie. As it is, it's rather poor, and definitely forgettable."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,MaxBorg89,0,misc,2009,10,"What does the title Il Divo mean? Well, it comes from ""Divo Giulio"", the Italian translation of ""Divus Iulius"", a Latin expression used to describe Julius Caesar. ""Divo"" translates as ""divine"", and the term was employed in regards to Caesar's outstanding power as well as his alleged otherworldly ancestry (the founder of his family, the Gens Iulia, was Aeneas, son of Venus). But of course, that has nothing to do with Paolo Sorrentino's masterpiece: the title refers to another Giulio, who has also been called ""Divo"" because of his considerable influence and longevity (he was 89 when the film was released). That man is Giulio Andreotti, largely considered the most important political figure in 20th century Italy.Although the unabridged subtitle of the Italian version reads ""The extraordinary life of Giulio Andreotti"", it doesn't chronicle all of the famed politician's life. Instead, it focuses on the most important period concerning his career: from 1978 to the early '90s. 1978 is, of course, when Aldo Moro, a member of the right-wing party Democrazia Cristiana just like Andreotti (Toni Servillo), was kidnapped and later executed by the Red Brigades. Andreotti shows no sign of emotion when he learns of the event, as usual: he has always been a quiet, secretive man. All that matters to him is the significant amount of power he gains over the years. As he points out when asked why he doesn't talk to God when he goes to church, ""priests vote, God doesn't"". Nevertheless, he certainly enjoys a little help from above when he is accused of various illegal activities, working with the Mafia and ordering assassinations being the most serious ones (let's not forget some conspiracy theorists believe he contributed to Moro's death, a conjecture that is dealt with in the film).Sorrentino obviously put a lot of research into his work, and the opening title cards, which explain the movie's context, are his way of making sure viewers don't find his effort too confusing. It clearly paid off, since the picture walked away with the Jury Prize at the 2008 Cannes Festival, silencing rumors about it being ""too Italian"". Predictably, the real Andreotti wasn't too impressed (word has it he even considered taking legal action against the filmmakers at one point). He obviously couldn't admit what happened on screen was true, so he made the following statement: ""I don't agree with Sorrentino's portrayal of me, but I understand he had to make certain dramatic choices to make it interesting; my real life is actually quite boring"". He has a point: there's a certain operatic grandeur to the scenes of the ""Divo"" walking around in government buildings and talking with his collaborators, a bit like in The Godfather. This gives the picture the greatness of a Greek tragedy, combined with the fiery spirit of politically charged movies like, say, Oliver Stone's body of work.The Stone comparison isn't accidental, since he directed Nixon, which, much like Il Divo, depended hugely on its leading man. Stone had Anthony Hopkins, while Sorrentino has his Robert De Niro, namely the superb Servillo, whose transformation isn't a mere make-up job (to see what he really looks like, one ought to check out the equally magnificent Gomorra): the Neapolitan actor doesn't just play Andreotti, he becomes him. It's a performance that gets past mimicry or impersonation - it's Andreotti as a person, not a movie character.So, the concerned party's opinion aside, everything speaks in favor of this ambitious, thought-provoking, stunning opus. In one word, to keep in with the complete title: extraordinary."
A Christmas Tale             ,Blade_Le_Flambeur,1,comedy,2010,7,"A Christmas Tale has been booked as an extremely unconventional holiday film from most major reviewers. This is a selling point-the film is a ""true"" examination of the holidays that offers no traditional entry and exit. It's the direct contrast of Four Christmases and at least one reviewer pondered ""If only American Christmas films could be like this one..."" Certainly, A Christmas Tale is unconventional, using Wes Anderson-like bookmark introductions as an omniscient narrator dictates the various children's upbringing. Scenes suddenly cut off in the middle or change. Things are never really explained. Two characters have a major feud between them but the origins are never quite described.This lack of knowledge and unpredictability gives A Christmas Tale an almost luminous ambiance. The film doesn't really move forward so much as float. Characters self-consciously talk about their own trappings in a theatrical way or muse about an event the audience was never privy too. It feels like the viewer is spying on this family, not in a Hitchcockian sense, but more as a privileged member. And although all of these distinctive attributes distinguish the film from more generic fare, it doesn't honestly add much. There is little emotional investment in the characters or their struggles, even though so much of the film depends on a sympathetic audience. The happy moments or the sad ones seem to do little to really effect anyone because such little is known about these people. The film feels airy and faint but it only lessens the impact.One wonders why this approach was chosen. Perhaps to get the audience to feel instead of think. It doesn't seem like A Christmas Tale really wants to offer something different, as primed by others. Instead the filmmakers simply want to tell a story that transports the audience to France. They want the viewer to invest in these characters struggles and feel for them. But the film is loaded with such sudden and copious amounts of joy and the usual suspects- a scruffy but loving husband, a stern but fair mother, the black sheep who doesn't understand, the loving husband who doesn't complain, the adolescent child who is trying to find his place... the list goes on. But what's the significance? Where's the punch? What's the so what?It's difficult to recommend this film even though the rating may not seem terrible. ""Worth watching"" is difficult to categorize in this place because the film feels like a continuation of this director's style but I know very little about his prior works. Check it out but don't expect much and you may be pleasantly surprised"
Kung Fu Panda             ,DICK STEEL,0,animation,2008,10,"It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there, regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your dream? Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they will sell. Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right. It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"", though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters' forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the various names of deadly moves, secret manuals, teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into a hearty laugh by the panda antics. For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you at first opportunity, is actually quite painful. As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here, it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda. And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens, I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project. "
Yes Man             ,jts0405,0,comedy,2009,7,"It has been awhile since Jim Carrey has come out with a comedy. His sad attempt at drama came in the form of The Number 23 last year in 2007, which completely sucked in all forms of sucking. Now he returns to the genre he shines in and that is comedy. This movie doesn't deliver laughs nonstop like in his other films, but the laughs are more realistic unlike other Carrey movies in which he does some crazy antics. We also see some decent supporting performances from Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson, who play Carrey's friends. The movie actually does play Carrey as a totally different character, he normally is a fun loving character, but in the beginning he is portrayed as an uptight person that never has any fun. It all changes and the plot unfolds when he begins to say yes to everything, which brings a pretty funny cameo from Terrence Stamp. The movie actually ends on a decent moral, with him deciding to only say yes to things he wants to and learning the true meaning of saying yes. So basically it is worth a watc"
The Express             ,Chrysanthepop,,misc,2009,NA,"'The Express', though based on Ernie Davis's life, is given a very Hollywood treatment. The story is uplifting and even inspiring to some, especially how Davis chooses to fight racism, not with violence, but with American football. Yet, the film itself is sugarcoated and has the deja-vu feel. For example, it is easy to predict which team will win (as is the case with most sports film). However, the last 20 minutes were handled well. Those scenes could have easily been melodramatic but the director chooses to play it down here. The background score is very intrusive at times. I thought the issue of racism was well tackled. This isn't 'just another movie about racism' because the conflicts are well depicted and dealt with (like one would think it would be in the 50s). Dennis Quaid definitely moves a step forward from his usual average acting. It's impressive to see him get under the skin of the character rather than play the usual formula. Rob Brown does a fine job and holds his own. Overall, 'The Express' tells an important story about a man who made a difference in American history even though his name is not known to everyone"
Untraceable             ,RetepAdam,1,crime,2008,6,"The movie had a few things going in its favor. For one, it used reasonable technology and background, so the story wasn't far-fetched. Secondly, and most importantly in my eyes, it did NOT go for shock value. It didn't try to use gore to elicit a reaction from the crowd. Not to say that some scenes weren't rough on the eyes, but it was far from a Saw or Hostel. Thirdly, it honestly kept me on the edge of my seat for a good portion of the movie. And lastly, the ending does not drag itself out. It ends at the logical point.That having been said, this movie will not change your life. It's a little bit of a commentary on society, but moreso, it's just an entertaining movie to watch. 1"
I Sell the Dead             ,slywlf54,,misc,2011,6,"I confess, I only watched this because I enjoy Ron Perlman, but I stayed with it because it is a hoot! It is neither excessively gory nor bloody, but it keeps its horror creds kinda side-wise, and kept me chuckling throughout. I find it hard to categorize this odd flick, but if you have the 90 or so minutes, give it a try - it is fun! The story line allows you to expect a bigger payoff than you get, but the actual story more than makes up for it. First you meet the apparent villain and his church appointed accuser. It rapidly becomes apparent that the real issues are not mundane but seriously supernatural!Vampires, zombies, grave robbers. The world is not as simple as you might wish.

Space Chimps             ,ChillYoda,,animation,2009,7,"I'm not really sure what you people were looking for, but this movie was, at worst, fairly enjoyable. It will not win the academy award for best animated film, but there are thousands of other, much, much worse animated films out there. This review isn't to help anyone decide if they should rent the movie or not (maybe I'm biased because I only paid $1.00 to rent it?), but more so to just defend it a little bit. My 5 and 6 year old sons got a kick out of it. THAT'S IT. Review could be over here. They are intelligent boys who have seen some great kids movies - and they recognize the great ones. They know this one was not one of the best movies they've ever seen. And they don't care. They pretty much enjoyed it, and that's all you should expect. It was a G-rated movie which is nice to see (they're watching ""Surf's Up"" - free on cable right now - and one of the characters said ""crap"" which I don't like). It had an OK plot, OK/somewhat amusing characters, some excitement, some funny stuff, a clear point/moral (people who don't catch that should NOT be allowed to write reviews). Stop making more of it than it is. I mean, one reviewer - or maybe it was on a message board - said (and I'm paraphrasing just a little bit), ""I didn't connect with any of the characters AND NEITHER DID MY 4 YEAR OLD SON."" I wonder how exactly they asked their 4-yr old the question... ""honey, did you feel a connection with any of the Space Chimps? How about the aliens? No, none of them either? Hmmm, I thought so..."" C'MON!! Hey, if you paid $10 bucks a pop to see this one, well shame on you. But otherwise, get over it, folks! It's not that bad"
Saw V             ,mmmmcrayons,0,crime,2008,2,"Okay i'm a very big Saw fan, and in my opinion, the directors should have just stopped making Saw movies after the third one. I could rave on about the fourth installment, but considering I'm writing a comment about the fifth, I won't. There were so many things wrong with this movie, especially the horrible ending. There was no twist mid-movie because they couldn't think of a clever enough ending.I'm also extremely disappointed about the lack of relevance the main Saw trap had to the movie. They all had something to do with a fire where eight people died...so what. But they'll probably reveal why they were all chosen in the sixth one, which I'm seriously considering not seeing.Yet another flaw, the crappy traps which could have easily been escaped by the seemingly mentally handicapped victims. At least in the final trap the two left had a moment of clarity realizing what they should have done to get out. But they ruined it by sawing half of their arm in half, when they could have just sawed off a finger and let the blood drain out.Alas, even more is wrong with this awful sequel. Detective Hoffman, in my opinion, seemed to be randomly thrown in to the entire storyline because the writers weren't clever enough to come up with a real twist. The story has become way to complex and I found myself, an avid film watcher, bewildered at points. Good thing Agent Strahm was there to reveal the plot line aloud and to himself.Now there's a series of questions that have been built up and Jigsaw and all of his accomplices are dead. So i guess the writers are going to have to come up with another random plot line, random character, take random scenes from the other movies, put the random character in them, and add a random trap that kills a bunch of moronic random people. Again.I hate to say this, but I actually caught myself laughing at the lame traps, stupid people, and a lot of Jigsaw's lines. (i.e. ""Killing is distasteful."").All in all, this movie was a disaster, an atrocity not even comparable with the rest of the Saw movies. I gave a 2/10 sheerly because it gave me something to whine about to my friends for the next couple of days."
Gran Torino             ,bd2004,0,drama,2009,NA,"Gran Torino is a Western.

Then just shoot everybody they tell you to or have a quick case of conscience, then shoot them - cool? Not.One scene is ripped straight from ""The Matrix"" series of films and the overall feeling is overwhelmingly Matrix/Terminator.

The Duchess             ,badajoz-1,1,misc,2008,3,"Another attempt to put real British history and characters on the screen for US audiences, only it does not contain much history - it was a really exciting period politically with loads of REAL characters far more interesting than the Duchess of Devonshire - and is just a tired retelling of parallels with the Charles/Diana/Camilla menage-a-trois done out with a glossy video of the best of UK country houses. Keira Knightley, over-exposed, cannot live up to the demands of being centre stage but does her best. Portrayal of aristocrats in 18th century is laughable, and, as for 'all girls together in a man's world, while I shag your husband'- what a total joke!Let Diana rest in peace!"
Twilight             ,svenjins,1,misc,2008,1,"Good adaptation? Excellent movie? I hope those of you writing these reviews never watch another movie again. I'm marking it as ""spoiler"" because it MIGHT contain some small ones, but if you go see this movie, it's already spoiled, rotted, and dessicated without any help from me.This movie stank. It was inept on almost every level. The acting was mediocre at best, the characters were poorly developed, the camera work was painful at times, the effects were laughably bad, the wirework is the worst I've ever seen, and the whole story is so ludicrous that I wanted to rip my hair out.First off, these aren't vampires. Dracula was a vampire. These ""vampires"" have almost nothing in common aside from drinking blood and being immortal and...wait, that's it. They walk in the daylight (and ooh! They sparkle, because teenie girls love sparkles!), they don't have fangs, they don't sleep in coffins, turn into bats, don't have an aversion to silver or garlic, walk over running water, don't mind crosses...the list goes on. Some of that is forgivable, but all of it? Nope. This is yet another pop-culture pussification of vampires, turning them into something ludicrous and throwing almost all the mythology out the window. Give me a nightwalking, bloodsucking, evil minion of the devil any day of the week. Don't call the Twilight ""vampires"" by that name because, quite frankly, they're not.Was the director of this movie high the whole time? Did she bother to try directing the actors, much less go over their dialog and realize that no normal human being would talk like that? The culmination of the two would be Bella blubbering in bed at the end for Edward to not leave her. I almost burst out laughing, but by then my soul had been sapped to the point that I thought laughter would be impossible. And I think her only direction for the vampires was, ""Okay, ready, set, ACTION! Okay guys, SMOLDER! SMOLDER! SMOLDER!"", because that's about the extent of the vampire ""acting"" in this movie. Lots of smoldering looks and very little else. And couldn't she have made sure the effects weren't awful? Seriously, who could have seen the fast vampire effect and thought it looked better than Scifi channel original movie effects? Did the director blow all the budget on crack to use while she was making this? And what was with the horrid wirework? Seriously. Watch Edward jumping from his window to the tree outside and see how he moves in a perfectly straight line. Watch the bad vampire jump over Bella and watch how his trajectory dips, then arcs UP, then drops in front of her. It's unbelievable. And did anyone else notice how the camera-work in the woods when Bella says she knows that Edward is a vampire was pointless and utterly distracting? Sorry, but that's not a good way to convey what was happening. Try again. Oh, wait, the studio decided you couldn't. Sorry.Why the heck is Edward so dreamy? He's a creepy stalker! He sneaks into Bella's room at night and watches her sleep? Oooh, so romantic! I sneak into a girl's room at night to watch her sleep? Pepper spray, a boot to the balls, and lots of community service. He follows her around wherever she goes? Nah, not stalking at all. He's just enamored with her and it's sooo dreamy! What a hairy load. Setting aside his saving her life twice (a contrivance so they can speed things up and they don't have to make them fall in love the old fashioned way), Edward could do anything to her and it would be so wonderful. I cannot understand that. Maybe that's why so many women will date total jerks and excuse everything they do. It explains a lot, actually.Sorry, but his movie is crap. Those who love it are likely so whipped up into a fervor about the book being turned into a movie that they'd watch anything with Edward in it. It could be Hostel 3: Vampire Style with Edward ripping limbs off of Bella in a bloodbath and it would be wonderful to them. Girls, I know you're obsessed with this fictional character in ways that only hardcore comic book nerds could ever hope to match, but please, step out of that bubble and actually WATCH the movie. Please. We don't need any more lazy, crappy cinema staining the multiplex screens. There's enough of that coming out of Hollywood these days. My wife loves the books (and I get to hear all about them...groan), but at least she's not so wrapped up in it that she couldn't admit the movie sucked. She's at least got that going for her. Other fans with claw your eyes out if you dare speak ill of it. Makes me wanna puke."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,gideonvd,,adventure,2009,NA,"A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a DVD casing from his ***. I got quit excited by the prospects of an other Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great, but boy, was I wrong.First off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so. I imagine the castings went something like this. ""Tell me, do you like fish?"" ""Yes I enjoy fish very much."" ""Wonder full, you're hired. Have some money."" Than there is the script. I have read Chabon, who I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did, but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out.This is an actual line from the movie; ""If you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before, than this moment becomes unique!"" Unique? Does it? Does it really? Off course not you plank. Please pass me the Imodium. I'll have a whole ****ing strip. The directing is... well. I've got nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to directing comedies. No stick to directing commercials. This movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie."
The Escapist             ,Gordon-11,,crime,2009,NA,"This film is about a man who is determined to escape from prison in order to reunite with his ailing daughter.""The Escapist"" is beautifully made, but I cannot say I enjoyed it. The main problem was the confusing delivery of the plot. Sometimes the characters are in the prison and sometimes they are in the tunnel trying to escape. The transitions are all sudden and unannounced. I could not work out if the story was linear or delivered in flashbacks until the last five minutes, but by then I have already decided that ""The Escapist"" is a huge waste of time.The ending twist makes the film considerably better. It resolves the previous confusions I have, but then five minutes of brilliance does not make up for 85 minutes of boredom."
The Bank Job             ,Deveousdevil,0,crime,2008,10,"This will be one of the best heist movie's you see in years. This movie is full of intense action and great wit. You will literally be at the edge of your seat up to the last minute, wondering if someone is either going to get killed or is someone going to get away. It is full of realistic drama, action, ultimatums, conspiracy and lust. At times it gets kind of scary and your heart will beat faster simply from the music. It is based on true story with a few additions of its own. The movie is put together absolutely perfectly.The movie is neither too long to the point it bores you and kills the story nor too short to where you don't know the outcome. Everything in the movie is timed perfectly and is played step by step. Everything makes sense which although eliminates some surprises, those surprises are hardly needed and are so obsolete that you won't even care nor realize.Overall the movie is ""jolly good"". British actors are really much better than American ones. All the emotions seem real and at a few points you'll feel just like the characters, which is great in any movie because it simply makes it more real. One more thing, this movie isn't for the faint of heart, there are a few scenes that are very graphic and gruesome, and a few scenes that should be in a rated ""X"" movie. Of course this doesn't do anything to the movie except add even more realism too it. This is just extra knowledge for those who may feel uncomfortable or squeamish in such scenes. Otherwise, this movie is a must to watch because it may very well be a classic."
Saw V             ,sneakythief-1,0,crime,2008,6,"Given that the Saw films are notable for their unexpected plot twists, the fact that this was the most predictable one makes it difficult to see why it scored the ""You won't believe how it ends"" tagline. Otherwise, it's decent. It blows Saw III out of the water, but I don't feel it really compares to the other three. I can appreciate that they're trying to bring it back to what the original was all about; a brilliant plot with a couple of gory scenes (the previous two have been somewhat gore-laden with little story for my liking), the problem being, unfortunately, that the plot is fairly weak. The intensity of the torture scenes is greatly increased, though, by the rest period between them. As a horror film, this works, but don't expect Saw - and don't expect to be blown away by the ending, because it is nothing special. That said, if you're addicted to the Saw saga as so many of us are, there's no harm in going out to see it. "
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,candy_flesh,1,adventure,2008,10,"I took my toddler to see this because he loves dogs, and I thought it would be a great chance or him to see his first film. I was not expecting to enjoy the film, but was truly amazed by how well done it was. Sure the dogs were cute & it definitely has appeal to children. But I found the messages (about finding your inner strength, being a good friend, not being stuck up, and about the importance of adopting stray animals & caring for those that are lost or abandoned) very well-executed, they were clear without bludgeoning the viewer on the head repeatedly as so many children's films do.I have to say the fact that the ""coyote"" who was meant to smuggle Chloe across the border was actually a Coyote, and the line about ""say hello to my little friends"" made me laugh long after I had left the theater.I plan to buy this film on DVD when it comes out & enjoy it with my family for years to come."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,sampotter25,,adventure,2008,NA,"I am quite a fan of novelist/screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel ""Wonder Boys"" became a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years back, and he had a hand in the script of ""Spider Man 2"", arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time.Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces, such as the gut-busting ""Dodgeball"" and the genius short film series ""Terry Tate: Office Linebacker"". And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, this seems like a no-brainer.It is. Literally.Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein, the son of a mobster (Nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in Economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works a minimum wage job at Book Barn, has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend/boss, Phlox (Suvari), which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex, with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion.One night at a party, an ex-roommate introduces Jon to Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. Later that night they go out for pie, and she asks Jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence, ""I want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul. If you do, it will make this night indelible."" Jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by, yet none of them look him in the eye. ""I imagine it must be what death feels like,"" he says.The next day Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps Jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts, doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. This doesn't sit well with Phlox, who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship, namely letting her meet his new friends and his father. The film then attempts to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his dead-end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane.There is a problem having us follow Jon throughout the film: he's completely uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to Jane the night they met. At the outset this isn't a problem. But he never gets any more interesting. He's a completely passive character. He simply follows along the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.Consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party, have sex and get in arguments. In other words, much ado about nothing. What we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside. Sweeping cinematography, ponderous voice-over with characters staring off into the distance, lots of sex scenes both straight and gay, big arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a tragic death... but it doesn't seem to matter. Ironically, at one point Jane, confused at a number of Jon's aimless actions, asks him, ""What's going on, Jon? What is this all about?"" Yes, Jon, do tell. We in the audience are dying to know, too.The title ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" must refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional stand-ins for actual people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them tick. We see them do lots of things, but we don't know why. And the absence of ""why"" is one of the worst things a movie can have. 1"
The Reader             ,topz-1,1,drama,2010,10,"Before I start reviewing, let me say something personal: As a German, one can hardly watch movies about the Holocaust, WWII or any related topic unbiased. As I have discovered myself, no German family is without a history related to the Third Reich, almost none are without grave guilt, or at least the fear thereof, and most who say otherwise either lie knowingly, or simply try to evade further inquiry. Reading some of the other reviews, I realized that for me, the movie conveyed something slightly, but decisively different: It is not so much about understanding HOW people could ever do the things they did, but rather how it is possible, that people we love, and people that have been loved by people we love could be so guilty and so loving, so despicable and lovable at the same time. It is about how we expect the guilt to show up somehow, how we expect to know the killer, the monster, at first sight and say: how could anyone not have seen it? Yet we have to admit sooner or later, that we were wrong, or were we? The question really is: How could I have ever loved someone who did things as horrible and disgusting as Hannah did? And just as much: If I am unmerciful now, having learned of their guilt, is it because they did what they did, or because they disappointed my own belief in their innocence?At one point, Hanna Schmitz asks the judge: ""What would you have done?"", and I think that therein lies an even more disturbing and unsettling question: What would I have done? What would you have done? How can anyone know for sure what WE would done? It is too easy to think of oneself as morally sound, with a firm belief in what is right and wrong. It's what Germans call the ""mercy of late birth"" - the luxury of not having been in the position to make that choice. So, what made this movie worth giving the full 10 points out of 10? It is well-crafted, well-played, believable, at times even beautiful. It captures both the fascination Michael feels with Hannah, and his disbelief, even disgust while exploring the ugly truth about her past. It conveys the struggle between our compassion and the reluctance to show mercy against the ones who did not. It leaves the viewer with the same, disturbing questions that have not been answered sufficiently in the past 60 years (nor will they ever be). It does not provide simple answers, but rather raises more questions, left to be unanswered. As Lena Olin's Character says: ""If you want Catharsis, go to the theater!""Other than providing beautiful, well-toned cinematography, a well-written script, love of detail and convincing performances even by the supporting cast - what more can you expect from a truly great movie?

"Surfer, Dude             ",Vic_max,0,comedy,2009,NA,"I generally like movies about surfing - documentaries, fiction and even animated flicks. While this movie started out fine, by the end, I really had no idea why the movie was made. Nothing really happens. Nothing. Furthermore, this movie is actually only 75 minutes long (without the credits)! That's pretty short, but it fits since there isn't really any story.I did like the beginning though - there are cool surfing shots, lots of specialized surfer lingo, and a cool introduction to McConaughey's character as a legendary surfer. And that was not all, the beginning also gives us an exotic high-tech firm w/3D virtual technology, a surfer reality show and even a flashy/upscale topless beach party (it was very well done!).However, in terms of where all these elements go, the movie tanks. McConaughey's character walks around confused and dejected because there's no surf ... all while he's continually assaulted by the high tech firm that's pressuring him to sign a contract.As a movie, it's pretty terrible. However, I must say that I still enjoyed a lot of the above elements for their fun-spirited nature. For the general viewer though, there's definitely no point in seeing this movie"
Milk             ,jpm-onfocus,0,misc,2008,9,"Gus Van Sant's talent and humility allows Harvey Milk to be a the center of this remarkable story without putting himself in front of the camera. Sean Penn shines with a new and extraordinary light as Harvey Milk. His humanity is overwhelming at times. That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter what. His awareness is filled with truth and innocence, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything. Little did he know.The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Josh Brolin, as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets under your skin. His romantic turn is one of the most compelling gay love stories I've ever seen (and I've seen Brokeback Mountain). Highly recommended! 2"
Prom Night             ,Nightman85,1,horror,2008,1,"...let me count the ways.1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook.2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.6. A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.7. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).8. A script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. 9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).10. A completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.It's a no-brainer horror fans, save your money.BOMB out of **** 2"
Prom Night             ,Aomalle27,1,horror,2008,2,"I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon ""retellings"", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichés are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular."
"Surfer, Dude             ",SerpentMage,0,comedy,2012,7,"I watch quite a few movie and from my review record I can pretty much watch any movie. My first and foremost priority is; does the movie entertain me? For this movie, check! Then my second priority is this movie original? For this movie half a check. And finally my third priority is, does this movie challenge my mind? For this movie, no not even close.This movie is pure entertainment. Though I have to say that Matthew McConaughey did a really good job. While people may say, ""oh look he is playing a stoner and laid back person. That is a no-brainer."" Actually not really, since a laid back person does not get uptight about anything, nothing gets them going.What surprised me in the movie is how well Matthew played the character. You saw it when he was challenged to a fight, and refused, or when he was insulted, or his words twisted. He played his character and I was surprised at how well he did it.So while it is not that original, though there are hints, it is very very entertaining. I found much of the critique of this movie completely misplaced..."
Igor             ,madmaxmedia,0,animation,2008,7,"I took my daughters (7 and 3) to see this movie today, knowing absolutely nothing other than seeing about 5 seconds of a TV commercial. I am normally relatively picky about what my kids see, but decided to join a friend who was going anyway. Plus my daughter loves Tim Burton, and this was at least stylistically similar.I thought this movie had a cool twisted sense of humor, and much more original than the typical warmed over rehashes we normally get from a lower-budget CGI flick. And guess what- not a single fart joke! That alone means it meets my very low expectations for what passes as children's entertainment these days. Unofortunately, I think it is a little too off- kilter for most, thus the small marketing budget as well.A nice little take on the classic Shelley Frankenstein tale. Not sure why the accusations of Nightmare Before Christmas rip-off, Frankenstein was obviously the source material for this story. Which is a very good thing in my opinion. Me and my daughters liked it a lot."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,Zombie-Kermit,0,animation,2008,5,"Fan buzz has been very negative for this movie. Myself, I have tried to remain positive. But even I, as a very lenient movie watcher has to admit that this really wasn't great. It's not on par with any of the other six movies of the franchise. It wasn't all bad though, and I will tell you what was good and bad about it now.The animation was a real mixed bag. It had great backgrounds that looked almost like they were taken right out of the movies, then you have these very poorly designed characters. As much as I liked most of the designs on everything but the characters themselves, I couldn't help looking at the animation like a beautiful painting with poo smeared in some spots. You can look at the painting, but it's hard to enjoy it when you can't take your eyes off the poo. It takes away from the potentially awesome animation. They look plastic and stiff, and the facial expressions and lip syncing look like something from a Playstation game from 1999. The voice acting was pretty bad as well, although Christopher Lee did and alright job, and Matt Lanter had a lot more emotion in his voice acting than Hayden had in the entire role.The dialogue was about as bad as can be. The exchanges between Anakin and his apprentice were all cliché and boring. Not to mention almost all the droids were like copies of Jar Jar Binks. A main problem was that I thought this would focus more on action than it did. That's why I felt all that lame childish stuff wouldn't matter. But it was mostly discussing the problems and treaties and stuff, which was the last thing this movie needed. There was a fair bit of action, but even when they were having awesome lightsaber duals, they felt the need to stop every 4 seconds and talk about stuff that I didn't need to hear, such as why they were having the battle. I wanted to see lightsaber duals on a level that they couldn't manage in a live action movie, and they did not deliver in this way. A lot of the other action was pretty good though, some being very fast moving and intense.The storyline really didn't consist of much.... just people trying to get Jabba the Hutt on their side, basically. This is not a movie that I think many old Star Wars fans will enjoy, but it may be a movie that helps introduce new people to the franchise, which is always a good thing. This is definitely a movie for the younger audiences, not older people and film critics. It basically just felt like a long TV Show episode, which is basically all it was. It was good for a TV episode, but not for a movie. If the action is as good in the series as it was in the movie (and hopefully there will be more), then I will be looking forward to it. But if they release another movie that looks to be at this level, I will have to wait until DVD. "
Four Christmases             ,Darkfrog24,1,comedy,2008,2,"It's as if these comedians had a bunch of random family-related scenes that got cut out of other things and decided to cobble them together into a movie. It didn't work.This movie has two good points. The very first scene, which introduces the two protagonists, is sharp and original. The very last scene is neat and funny. Almost nothing in the middle was any good.The most crippling problem is probably one conversation that Vince Vaughn's character's has with his girlfriend. It's supposed to represent him coming to terms with the issue behind their last fight, but he does so by making a series of sarcastic jokes that are not meant to be taken literally and have no emotional depth. In other words, the scene is trying to tell us that the character can be serious but it's showing us that he can't. It just wasn't well thought out."
Stop-Loss             ,adx2-1,0,drama,2008,6,"When I saw the preview, I thought it would be an accurate portrayal on how stop-loss affects soldiers. Unfortunately, it was a little off the wall in how it showed Brandon getting stop-lossed. In reality, stop-loss takes place 90 days prior to deployment and stays in effect until 90 days after the soldier returns. Each unit is given one year of ""dwell time"" in the US, which means they won't deploy during that period. The film's portrayal of Brandon getting stop-lossed only a week after he returned from Iraq to go to Iraq again for another tour a few weeks later was as realistic as shooting 100 rounds from an M4 without changing the magazine once. Also, with his actions after he was stop-lossed (saying f*** the President, going AWOL, etc...) he wouldn't have just went back to Iraq still a Staff Sergeant like he did at the end of the movie. He probably would have gotten a court-martial instead.Other than those things, it isn't a bad movie. Just inaccurate. I served three tours in Iraq already and I was stop-lossed for my second one. I knew I was stop-lossed over three months before I left, they didn't wait until two weeks before it was time to go to tell me I was stop-lossed. I made the decision to reenlist later on instead of getting out at the end of my second tour."
21             ,ccthemovieman-1,0,crime,2008,8,"I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: ""Professor Mickey Rosa,"" played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - ""Ben Campbell"" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an ""8"" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up ""card counters"" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.So, enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,LeonardMonichi,0,misc,2008,5,"I didn't expected this movie to be much fun, but it was! The story obviously wasn't that great and the ending was predictable. But this movie didn't pretend to be ""intelligent"", it never tries it! The story is told clearly and there aren't to much unnecessary scenes. The dancing is good and there are various funny scenes! Everything a entertaining mainstream movie has to have. The acting is mostly OK, no major problems found, although there are a lot of stereotypes used in the movie (the handsome white guy, the envious ex-girlfriend, the ""Looser"", the ""bad"" black guy,...). But which movie doesn't have them? I also like the soundtrack, a lot of good tracks can be hear with great dancing performances. This movie deserves 5 out of ten points!"

A priest, Father Duffy(Ron Perlman), wants to hear Blake's confession, demanding to know how he got to where he now is, a cell awaiting his execution. So, with some whiskey at hand, supplied by Duffy, Blake begins to elaborate his life of notoriety as a grave-robber, a life long partner and apprentice of Willie Grimes(Larry Fessenden, in perhaps his greatest role to date, stealing every scene he's in). Forced by blackmail into giving a doctor corpses(Angus Grimm who looks like Ebenezer Scrooge), Blake and Grimes soon discover the undead(!)while digging up a grave located outside of their village's cemetery and this actually leads to some minor moments of prosperity as they are able to rid themselves of Quint(Grimm)and benefit from a clientèle willing to pay big bucks for vampires(they actually favor the ghouls from ""The Evil Dead"" rather than your usual more romanticized vampires)as to discover the secret to immortality. We learn about a new apprentice, and love interest to Blake, for Grimes, Fanny Bryers(Brenda Cooney)who uses her feminine wiles in order to manipulate them into boating to an island where crates carrying the undead are located even though they are reluctant due to the fact that the House of Murphy were commissioned for the job. We see that Willie was indeed beheaded for his crimes and that while they were on the island, Grimes was bitten by a vampire. There's an amusing twist involving Duffy's real motives behind ""interrogating"" Blake, and ""I Sell the Dead"" is rife with all sorts of gallows humor. I think this movie's success is in the perfect casting, Monaghan, to me, has never been better and his storytelling is handled with jolly good flair. Perlman, as his ears to the endless series of strange vignettes, and Fessenden as Blake's grimy, but loyal, partner-in-crime add substantial support. The score is quite reminiscent to Danny Elfman and fits the movie's tone suitably well. A Burke and Hare comedy featuring the undead, how could I not like this? My only gripe is some rather blah computer graphics, although I love the hell out of a good ""talking decapitated head"" gag. Some minor cannibalism with a spattering of gore from time to time. I just adore the way Blake describes the House of Murphy and how the director presents them. I also liked how the director evokes the period, with plenty of Gothic touches here and there. I do wish the movie had more of Scrimm. The movie's most bonker highlight regards a certain frozen corpse Blake and Grimes are hired to collect, which introduces us to Cornelius Murphy. There's some magnificent lighting on display in this film, such as how Cornelius is shadowed. Cleverly edited as well. A real treat for fans of black humo"
Bolt             ,radioactive_man21,0,animation,2008,9,"I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. Disney has created some lovable characters who will definitely win the hearts of millions. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done. 1"
Goodbye Solo             ,rb545rd,0,drama,2008,10,"Without a doubt this was the best film I saw at the Toronto Film Festival. My girlfriend and I decided to make a trip up there for a few days to see some films, enjoy the city and catch Niagara Falls. We saw some good films, and some not-so-good films, but most of them were good... but none of them captivated us like Goodbye Solo. It was on our short list because we had seen and really liked Chop Shop-- by the same director. This one is even better. The lead actor is just amazing!! This guy is going to win some awards. He is so charming that you can't help but want to watch everything he does. The whole audience was laughing for like the first half of the film because him and the old man - the big dawg! - are just so funny together and the things they say and do together are just great... but it was the ending that really got us. My girlfriend was crying. So were a lot of people around us... And the last shots are really beautiful. I don't know where they filmed it, but the location was amazing. The mountain and the trees and fog... it was just amazing how the filmed those colors and fog, like it wasn't real or something. The film really, really moved us and stayed with us for the rest of our trip and we talked about it a lot on our drive home. Solo changed so much in the film... that guy is a great actor. We will see it again when it comes out for sure."
Flash of Genius             ,bjones,0,misc,2008,10,"It was great to see Greg Kinnear in another flawless performance; here as Dr. Bob Kearns, inventor and professor. To me, I think of Mr. Kinnear as sort of the cocker spaniel of American actors. Perfectly companionable for just about everyone. He just feels right in so many roles it's hard to imagine anyone else having done them. This is another instance of his having added immeasurably to what may have otherwise been a more uninteresting character. After all, it's hard to imagine anyone making an engineer or professor seem interesting; but in this outing Kinnear certainly accomplishes that.Adding her own note of quiet grace and perfect screen presence, Lauren Graham as Phyllis Kearns gives her character both charm and great heart, not to mention that she looks better in a plain white nightgown that just about anyone I've seen... well, except for my wife, of course.There are other great performances here too, like Mitch Pileggi as the bad guy from any corporation in America, Tim Kelleher as his greasier side-kick and Dermot Mulroney as a slightly smarmy friend of Kearnes'. Likewise the hoard of young actors playing the Kearns children added a perfect familial note to the vehicle.But, more than any of these fine people, the focal point here was the story as it always is in these social consciousness melodramas. Yes, Virginia. The wheels of American industry is greased with the bones of the cheated and betrayed genius of America. That is so universally true it's a well known sub-plot to all of America's engineers and manufacturers. What is also well known is what happens when they try to find justice, let alone an iota of truth; which is so accurately and skillfully portrayed in this film.Speaking as an engineer who has worked in American industry for over 40 years, I can say that I have seen this more times than I can count. It goes on every day right here under your noses, America, and no one ever does a thing to change the way America fails to protect her fragile genius. That is deliberately so. That is so because the laws America uses to define how these things are handled are made by lawyers, for lawyers. It would cease to be profitable if the laws were crafted to actually protect it's most precious resource - it's creative people. But it's not; the laws are instead crafted to provide fat and frequent paychecks to every leach that slithers through the ""halls of justice"".Just as Kearns did, I had to learn the hard way that justice in America belongs only to those with a fat enough wallet to buy it through the local outlet. If you don't have the six figures to hire a lawyer then you have no rights and no freedom in this country. Like a Wildebeest grazing blissfully in the middle of the herd, you have only not been awakened to that fact yet because no one has yet decided to attack you, or steal from you.This has been the long way around to tell you that the creators of the film got it exactly right, with one serious flaw... for every Bob Kearns who has eviscerated themselves to win a Pyrrhic victory of the sort we witness here, there have been thousands who have given up for being too shallow in pocket or too short of mental fortitude or too short of the desire for self-flagellation required to press through to an empty, moral victory.And even here, we see unmistakably that this ""victory"" costs Kearns what he valued most in his life. He didn't even live to see himself depicted as ""heroic"" in this fine film.Still, thank you Bob, wherever you are. "
The Merry Gentleman             ,lavatch,,crime,2019,NA,"There is a lot of irony to the title ""The Merry Gentleman"" about a hit man named Frank Logan. It is also curious to think of this film as a ""thriller."" Instead, it is an insightful character study of two people who are apparently deeply in love but cannot connect, due to extenuating circumstances.Those circumstances have to do with the suicidal nature of the hitman Frank Logan. Michael Keaton is terrific as the self-loathing tailor by day and contract killer by night. Frank is ""saved"" by Kate (Kelly Macdonald) when he is about to jump off a building. There is no doubt that from Frank's perspective, Kate is his guardian angel.The romance is disrupted by an extremely efficient police detective, who pieces together the story of Kate ""saving"" Frank. In a flagrant violation of protocol, the detective has a romantic interest in Kate, and he shamelessly flirts and invites her on dates. The naïve Kate has to be wondering what is happening to her, especially as she has recently fled from an abusive man. When she says that she must ask God for forgiveness, Frank has to remind her that she hasn't done anything wrong.Some viewers may be disappointed in the relative absence of ""action"" in this film. But it is clear that the intent was that of insightful character development, not fast-paced action. Some of the best scenes are the quiet ones, such as the initial meeting of Kate and Frank when she has fallen under the weight of the large Christmas tree she has purchased; a conversation in the hospital where Frank is recovering from pneumonia; and a meeting in church where neither character looks at the other for the entire sequence.The film's ending failed to resolve basic questions about the main relationship of Frank and Kate. It also failed to answer a myriad of questions that the viewer wants answered. This was obviously intentional on the part of the screenwriter. But it was the only shortcoming this thoughtful and well-produced film. The screenplay was filled with interesting details about the characters, which makes ""The Merry Gentleman"" a film worth viewing on multiple occasion"
Ghost Town             ,Matt_Layden,0,misc,2008,7,"After dying for a little less then seven minutes after going in for some minor surgery. Dentist Pincus begins to see dead people. The dead people, finally having someone who can see and hear them, try to get him to finish their business so they can finally leave this world. Only problem is Pincus is a loner who hates people.It's Ricky Gervais' dry humour and wit that seem to elevate Ghost Town and make it stand out in the crowd of numerous other clichéd romantic comedies. That's not saying that this film isn't clichéd, it has them left right and centre. Although with Gervais taking a different approach to the material then what most other leading men would do in this situation, Ghost Town becomes a film that people will actually enjoy and not roll their eyes at.We start the film off with the death of Greg Kinnear, and if you think that is a spoiler then you have no idea what this movie is about. After that we are treated to the 'people person' that is our lead character. We get this immediately with his treatment to his patients and other co-workers. Although, after his surgery, he opens his eyes and start seeing ghosts around the town. This is when the clichéd bits start kicking in. With every film in which a living character can see and speak with ghosts, you get the obligatory ""Is he crazy?"" as people around him see him speak to no one. We've seen this stuff over and over again and while it would obviously happen, it's not funny and that's the difference. Ghost Town tries to get a laugh every time it happens.You know those films when people walk through a ghost and they get the chills, while this film has that, they put a little twist on it. The character sneezes. For whatever reason, it's never explained, but I guess when you're dealing with this subject matter you can start creating your own rules. Speaking of rules, Ghost Town follows the basic flow chart of every rom-com that has been out there before it. So don't really expect to see something new.This is Gervais first leading film, after having successful television shows with ""The Office"" and ""Extras"" he is branching out to film. This is an interesting choice for his first outing, and while it does work, I would have liked to see him do something different. He sure has the comedic chops to tackle different forms of comedy. He has his own spin on things and it's all in the delivery. With comedic actors like Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy failing to get laughs (Love guru, Meet Dave) it's nice to see the light shine on someone else. Someone that is currently not in the Apatow crew either.As with the talking to no one bits, there is also the ""tell me something that only I would know"" routine. Although, I will give Koepp props, because this time it doesn't work out so well. I like Koepp as a director, Stir Of Echoes and the Trigger Effects are both well made films. This is his first time writing and directing a comedy. If you want to count Toy Soldiers as a comedy then go ahead, he did write that. He does a decent job of pacing the film with the laughs and adding the emotional punches when it's needed. As most rom-coms do, it takes a dramatic turn and the comedy goes away for about 15 minutes, Maybe you'll need a Kleenex, maybe not.While Ghost Town does follow the basics for a romantic comedy, it does have the s slight advantage of having Ricky Gervais on it's side. If you've never seen his material, Ghost Town is an alright choice to start with, but I still recommend his television work over this. You'll get some laughs from here, Tea Leoni holds her own and Greg Kinnear has the hardest part in the entire film. So in the end, the film works and does what it's suppose to do."
One Missed Call             ,addledsam,0,horror,2008,2,"Awful, absolutely awful. Had free tickets, but still, I knew better. Of course, all the clichés you'd expect, dumb young adults, scares that come from someone jumping into the screen and sound effects that go ""boom"" simultaneously, and the build up to when suddenly the main character is the one in eminent danger. Quick cuts of ""scary"" images. Did I mention the ""creepy"" music that lets you know when the mood should be tense? Now, add to that a premise that goes beyond the bad premises of other movies in the genre. Possessed cell phones? Or is it possessed ghosts that have to travel through cell lines? Oh man. The crowd I saw it with erupted with laughter numerous times at crucial plot points. Download that game ""snake"" for your cellphone, it's a lot scarier. 2"
What Happens in Vegas             ,jaredmobarak,1,comedy,2008,3,"I went into the screening of What Happens in Vegas thinking I was in store for a train-wreck; I mean the trailer looked horrible. I suffer the pain for all of you readers, though, in the hopes that you won't have to live the same fate. In actuality, the movie ended up being a same-old, same-old rom-com that had some laughs, but overall just plodded along to its inevitable conclusion. Being that this pair of New Yorkers, married after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas, must spend six months as man and wife before a judge decides what to do with the three million dollar jackpot they won, one would think we'd get a lot of their trials and tribulations, probably way too sentimental for anyone to stand. Instead, we get gag after gag as the two attempt to sabotage the union to take the money for themselves. Only about half the film takes place during the six months, however, it feels like six years. I couldn't believe the running time was only an hour and a half, it felt a lot longer. All this said; if someone has their mind set on seeing a film of this kind, my words would not detract you<U+0097>something the producers know. I'll say one thing, whomever came up with the marketing plan of selling Las Vegas with the tag used in the title here is going to bed with a smile this weekend, snuggling up with the piles of money overflowing his room<U+0097>he couldn't ask for a better affirmation of that simple phrase.The premise itself is just a rehash of the same dried up plot used in Hollywood whenever the bank seems a tad low. Man and woman get together, are forced to stay together against their will, and eventually find out all the good things they didn't notice about each other beforehand. We have the stereotypical friends trying to help their buddy come out of the situation unscathed and a winner; the token parents and ex-fiancé who set into motion the events that get the odd couple to meet; and the supporting roles that help infuse some much needed comedy into an otherwise stale story. I do jest somewhat; the movie isn't without some good moments. The scenes that are overplayed in the TV spots fall flat of course, but there are other moments saved for the big show that deliver. I will admit to loving the work retreat for our leading lady, mostly due to Dennis Farina's scene-stealing cameo as her boss. He is absolutely hilarious, whether it is his mannerisms, his facial expressions towards Chong and her husband, or his complete exuberance tempered with a strict work ethic.I should probably mention the leads before I go too far. Admittedly, I don't care very much for either Cameron Diaz or Ashton Kutcher. If I hadn't the knowledge of Kutcher being married to Demi Moore, I'd have been totally taken out of the film just by the age difference between these two lovers. No offense to Diaz, but she isn't getting any younger. Their real age difference is only six years, yet it appears to be much more here. Diaz isn't horrible, she is herself; if that is your thing you won't be disappointed. Kutcher, however, actually surprised me a bit. He is quite likable here, even when partaking in blatant subterfuge and hijinks. Far from being a great actor, he plays the role perfectly, even hamming it up to uncomfortable levels when ""acting"" in his role. Trying to show emotions that his character is faking leads to very funny moments and such horrible acting one must credit him for seeming natural when being himself. The two have some chemistry and you can see the abrasive union mixed with understanding and an ability to be truthful to each other. When they begin to fall for one another towards the end, (seriously, this shouldn't be ruining anything for you), I really started to enjoy their relationship. It was a good payoff from the over-the-top antics of hatred at the start.As for the supporting cast, there are some gems and some wasted talent. Once again, much like Stranger Than Fiction, I don't know what Queen Latifah is doing. I really enjoy her and find it incomprehensible that she needs to take throwaway roles like this to stay afloat<U+0085>someone please offer her a real part. Lake Bell is funny and endearingly sassy and sarcastic as Diaz's best friend Tipper while Rod Corddry vaults himself out of my not-a-fan-of ranks to be funny at all times. It appears that he can be likable when playing an ass, rather than a man of power that doesn't realize he is an ass (Harold & Kumar 2). Treat Williams brings some nice touch to his father role, some added laughs as well as heart, and even Zach Galifianakis has his moments playing pretty much the same role he does in everything he touches.I really wanted to just bash on this film, but while feeling long and without any originality, I didn't absolutely hate it. The acting was fine and not without its moments while some of the setups delivered on their attempts for comedy. You will start to get tired of the games they play with each other as the ante is upped over and over again, more for the benefit of the audience then any real plot necessity. Once the two calm down and start to really see each other is when I must say I got a bit caught up in everything. Still, though, I can't recommend anyone go out and spend your hard-earned Friday night cash for this one. All I can say is that sitting through the first 90 minutes does payoff with the greatest two scenes of the entire movie at the start of the credits. If you're already paid for and in your seat, don't leave earl; those final moments are priceless."
Summer Hours             ,lasttimeisaw,1,drama,2013,8,"My only previous Assayas' approach is Maggie Cheung's Cannes BEST ACTRESS nabbing feature CLEAN (2004, 7/10), and for most Chinese media, Assayas seems to alway been in an ill-fated personage as Maggie's ex-husband. But his works matures splendidly with finesse and sobriety (from CLEAN to SUMMER HOURS), the latter resounds a similar pace of meditation and quietude as Hirokazu Koreeda's STILL WALKING (2008, 8/10), tackles with a slice of family life, with a contemplation towards the domestic heredity, globalized opportunism, alienated generations and art conservation. In dealing with a sentimental demise of a bourgeoisie matriarch, who resides in a suburban villa near Paris with all her uncle's art menagerie and his worthwhile sketching books (apparently he was a renowned painter himself and an unspeakable family secret), Assayas infills an indefatigable stamina to keep all the delicate matters in a civil restraint, the contradiction abounds among three siblings in regard to keep or sell the villa; and the proceedings of donating valuable art pieces has also been a bumpy road; for the elder son, he also has teenage children to worry about, and last but not the least, his abiding remembrance of the past is the most poignant blow to one who can fit into his shoes under the circumstances.The show has never been slid into a thespians' melodrama notwithstanding the fact that its indulgence of a top-billing Gallic cast, a blonde Binoche incarnates a very light-touch casualness as the metropolitan daughter, living in USA and dedicates herself more in bringing the work of art abroad for the international exposure; Renier, the younger son, finds both an opportunity in settling down in China and an exigent situation in which the profit of selling the villa couldn't come as timely as possible. While these two are soon-to-be-goners, without a pinch yearning for their homeland, the liability all falls on the elder brother (Berling), whose true-to-life embodiment of his character anchors the film's backbone in a concrete formality, it is a prickly situation will come about to anyone eventually. Edith Scob, as the deceased mother, whose first 30-minutes appearance contrives to establish herself as an indomitable shadow encroached by the past, when she is gone, something else will be taken with her together and forever, Scob is pitch perfect in her role's demanding of the physical infirmity, an unswerving mind of knowing her time is up and the duty as a bequeather.I have not conceal my preference to this quiet, reflective lifelike imitation than other more grandstanding razzle-dazzle, it is a simple film with a concise message delivered eloquently by the mastery of Assayas who auspiciously shoulders on the privilege of an auteur not only in the French terrain, but also as an international landmark, like many of his precedent compatriot"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,edjavega,0,action,2008,7,"Reading all the comments here, it looks like this is one of the worst films ever made, and it's absolute rubbish, Shia's character is Jar Jar Binks, etc.But it's earning a ton of money, and the rankings (7.6) are high, so what does that tell you? That compared to the haters, MOST people came to his movie expecting a fun adventure movie and got it.Look, the Indiana Jones movies aren't flawless. Even in the previous movies, you had to suspend belief (people melting? someone surviving a fall from a plane just on a craft? a Knight living more than 1,000 years?) and just enjoy the action scenes - and you have them here! Mutt swinging on the vines is real corny but the car chase through the jungle, complete with sword fight, fisticuffs, giant ants, etc. - they are what you can expect from an Indiana Jones movie. And Cate Blanchett is a SUPER villain, Harrison somehow makes it all believable for him to still be an action star at 60 plus, and it's great to see Marion Ravenwood again.STAR WARS I was a major major disappointment, but this one is NOT. We have wanted to see Harrison Ford suit up as Indy again, and here he has a good cast with him, and yet we bash the movie because it isn't RAIDERS? Nothing can be as much fun as the first Indy Jones movie. But this one is still MUCH MUCH better than any adventure movie out there for the past several years.Just watch it with an open mind. Don't expect miracles, but fun entertainment for 2 hours and you will get it. 2"
Nim's Island             ,Chrysanthepop,1,adventure,2008,NA,"'Nim's Island' is one of those films that had the potential to be a great adventure flick but, sadly, misses the mark. The screenplay is inconsistent and the script loses focus. Most of the characters aren't well developed, some are unnecessary and would have been better left out. While there are many plot holes, there are some unnecessary (and irritating, especially the sequences with the caricature bad guy visitors in the island) subplots. The entire film revolves around Nim being stranded on the island all by herself as her father is lost somewhere at sea and a 'borderline' agoraphobic Alexandra travelling to the island to rescue her. The climax is very disappointing. When one sees Nim and Alexandra meet for the first time, something big is expected but nothing like that happens. I would have much preferred that the film focus on Nim and Alexandra's adventure in the island and their attempt to rescue Jack but there's nothing like that. Moreover, the look of the film isn't that appealing. There are some nice glimpses of the island but the CGI is poor and use of green screen copy pasting is too obvious (due to poor lighting). I liked the animal characters but only the adorable sea lion looked realistic. Abigail Breslin and Gerard Butler are okay but they are mostly let down by the shoddy screenplay. However, Jodie Foster was amusing to watch. It's great to see her in a comedic performance and she carries off the eccentric Alex's 'borderline' agoraphobia and determination to save Nim with comic flair. It is her scenes that save 'Nim's Island' from being a total disaster. The film ends on a note that there might be a sequel. If there is, well I hope it has much more to offer."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,Argemaluco,1,drama,2009,6,"I went to see The Secret Life of Bees thinking it would be a light version of The Color Purple and,on some way,it resulted to be like that.However,I would not call it a copy,because although it deals with similar subjects to the ones of that excellent movie,The Secret Life of Bees has a different style and sensibility.But the biggest difference is that,while The Color Purple was tremendously honest,The Secret Life of Bees feels thick and a little bit cloying.This is a mediocre film but I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained.First,let's see positive points.At the difference of many ex-childish actors,Dakota Fanning is facing her adolescence with aplomb,good presence and brilliant histrionic ability,as she shows on this movie.I am also very happy to see that her image as a ""miniature adult"" has disappeared.It will be very interesting to see the future of her career and I hope she has as much luck as Jodie Foster,Ron Howard and other ex-childish stars who avoided emotional and professional problems on their adult career.Jennifer Hudson and Queen Latifah have conventional characters (independent woman and wise matron,respectively) but they bring very competent performances.However,the member of the cast who most impressed me is Paul Bettany.He completely becomes into his character and he shows an unusual level of intensity and credibility.And,as I have previously said,the movie kept me moderately entertained in spite of being mediocre.Now,let's go to the negative elements.The Secret Life of Bees is based on a book written by Sue Monk Kidd and the adaption director and screenwriter Gina Prince-Bythewood made suffers from the syndrome of ""book taken to the big screen"".Maybe,Prince-Bythewood wanted to include moments from the book which may were important for her,but not necessarily to the story and as a result,we have many irrelevant moments and other ones which come from nowhere and they do not contribute in anything to the story.Besides,there are various forced scenes which try to make us cry at any cost.In other words,those scenes do not feel honest at all,because they have a lot of manipulation and artificial dramatism.The Secret Life of Bees is not a bad movie.I just found it redundant and too forced,while all the moments which should be honest feel forced.I think I can give this movie a slight recommendation because of its excellent performances and because it kept me moderately entertained"
Kung Fu Panda             ,Joejoesan,0,animation,2008,8,"When you watch Kung Fu Panda you can't help but wonder: why wasn't this done before? Kung fu and CGI make a terrific mix in this entertaining tale of a clumsy fat panda who becomes a true kung fu master. The story in short: panda bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a big kung fu fan. He has all the action figures of his idols, Master Tigress, Viper, Tigress, Monkey and Mantis - also known as the Furious Five, and dreams of one day becoming a kung fu master himself. In the meantime he sells noodles. When evil leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes from prison a Dragonwarrior is chosen to defeat him. Yes, our reluctant hero Po turns out to be the one! He gets a kung fu training from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), who - after a few disastrous attempts - discovers that the only way to teach Po real kung fu is to lure him with food. But will Po be strong enough to beat Tai Lung?Kung Fu Panda doesn't start with a bang. The first laughs are results from the slapstick humour. Po is a lovable creature and everyone can relate to a person who dreams of the impossible. When Tai Lung escapes you're really into the story. This particular scene is pretty spectacular. It takes place in a dark cave and the way Tai Lung jumps around really gives you the impression that he's an enemy to be reckoned with.What also works in the movie is the chemistry between Po (Jack Black) and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). The latter easily steals the show as the grumpy kung fu master who doesn't believe in his mission to guide Po. The scene in which Shifu has a food fight with Po is an instant classic. There's also a great action scene in which Tigress, Mantis and the others try to stop evil Tai Lung. They fail, of course... And the down side? There aren't that many bad things in Kung Fu Panda. Hoffman and Black make the movie. The role of Tigress (Angelina Jolie) could have been done by many other voice actresses. Jackie Chan (Viper) only has three or four lines and that's a shame. The final fight is - at some moments - rather violent. That can scare away some of the younger (3-6 year old) kids. Dreamworks wants to turn Kung Fu Panda into a Shrek like franchise. They're right. There's enough material in here to make at least two more sequels. And CGI animated kung fu kicks really work on the big screen! So let them make a Kung Fu Panda 2. As long as they keep Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu in the story!8/10"
Lakeview Terrace             ,ferguson-6,0,crime,2008,5,"Greetings again from the darkness. If director Neil LaBute's last film wasn't enough reason to boycott this film, surely the ridiculous trailer was, right? Well, not when one is addicted to movies and ""Ghost Town"" is the other weekend opener.Besides, LaBute does have ""The Company of Men"" on his resume, though that is more than negated by ""Nurse Betty"". But c'mon, Samuel L Jackson as an angry, prejudiced, screw-loose cop? That's got to have some good moments, eh? Sure enough, the first 30-45 minutes of the film deliver the level of uncomfortableness that LaBute was after. Viewers struggle to tell if Jackson is truly well meaning or actually the world's worst neighbor.The objects of his disaffection are Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington, the interracial couple who move in next door. Jackson's menacing looks and words and his ability to flash a badge make for quite a nightmare for the two love birds.The film starts out seeming to test our beliefs and opinions on race but then spins off the axis and winds up being almost as ridiculous as ""The Wicker Man"" ... I said ALMOST! The last 45 minutes, I pretty much just kept thinking to myself ... ""are you kidding"". The ending certainly could have been handled much better given the few moments of brilliance throughout the movie. Quite the cop-out (pun intended)."
The Bank Job             ,prbt,0,crime,2008,6,"I liked the film to start with - bit cheeky, typical London ""cops, robbers and gangsters"" fare. Then after the heist was done, the tone darkened, uncomfortably so. If it had stayed lighter throughout, I'd have enjoyed it much more.All the actors were fine (I like the fact that you know what you're getting with Jason Statham - you don't *want* him to come across as 'actorly', you *want* him to play the lovable hard-man), the direction was slick, and the film was never boring. Worth a rental when it comes to DVD.One last comment: I know it says 'BASED on a true story', but I can't believe more than the bare bones are in any way factual."
A Christmas Tale             ,anders-lundin,1,comedy,2008,3,"This film promised a lot, so many beautiful and well playing actors but with a plot that had virtually NOTHING to say. So many potentially promising conflicts between the family members that could have been developed and elaborated but it was all dropped and not taken care of. There was no story to be told, just a show off of acting, technique, beautiful scenes - that were all EMPTY. But again, the acting was excellent so many of the individual scenes were entertaining, but as you became increasingly aware of the lack of underpinning ideas, even the acting lost its sense. So from the promising start you became increasingly disappointed as the non-story went along."
Stop-Loss             ,XFilesRocks,0,drama,2008,NA,"I really liked this movie. I wasn't looking for a bloody battle scene and there wasn't much of that expressed. Most of what was conveyed was the loss of friends in a situation that could happen to soldiers who march into harms way. Then the soldiers return home, back to the way things were? Their lives are not the same, and the people at home can't understand because they weren't there to see a friend die in their arms at the hands of some terrorist killers.My brother just retired from the Army. He volunteered in Iraq for 1 year. He safely returned home, but his life had changed from that moment he was in Iraq. He said they lost a few young men, and another returned home severely burned from a cocktail thrown into the vehicle. At 130 degrees, how can they keep the windows closed in a military vehicle with the engine off. Two men that died were young (18 and 20). I feel the young soldiers have not received enough training and are too young to deal with the stress of war. The movie had me thinking about the young men and women that barely have a year of training and next have RPGs hurling at them, roadside bombs, suicidal bombers walking into streets. How can anyone be trained to deal with that and be aware of it before it happens?I commend the different positions on war in this movie: 1) Soldiers who are willing to die for their families and country. 2) Soldiers who have served their country and feel they should have the choice to step down from their jobs.Stop-loss was something I never heard of until I saw the movie. How on earth can we say in the United States we have FREEDOM to choose if that privilege is removed when you enlist? It is like when you quit a job, move to another state, join a religion. FREEDOM to Choose! The Stop-Loss sanction nullifies the FREEDOM to step down after serving your country for 1 term or more. Do they think that will encourage people to sign up to serve in the armed forces if the contract removes their basic right of FREEDOM that we all hold so dearly. I was angry to hear soldiers are forced to return to serve multiple times. Many soldiers clearly need to stay home to recover and try to live a normal life instead of sending them back to die. It sounds as if these soldiers are no more than a body with a gun to send back into war.I would recommend seeing this movie!"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,svivschenk,,animation,2019,NA,I'd only reccomend watching it if someone else under 10 wants to. Its a generic kids movie that is like BTTF and POTC with Veggietales become the most... ehhhhhhh ... movie experienc
The Dark Knight             ,littlemartinarocena,0,action,2008,9,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo! 3"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,labsjoao,0,misc,2008,1,"I can not begin to describe how awful this movie was. Even worse than its predecessor, Step Up 2 manages to be even more predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen from the first ten minutes. The script was ridiculous. The story could not have been more cliché. The movie tries to have many subplots but it fails to achieve an enjoyable storyline. The movie paints a very unrealistic college and street dancing life, and that is fine, but the problem is that this movie tries too hard to make it seem real.They attempted to throw some humor in this god awful hideous picture when they portray an Asian foreign student and ridicule her for her accent and lack of correct English language. There was some cool dancing but honestly, it wasn't nearly enough to save this movie. The low rating says it all."
Wanted             ,raypdaley182,1,action,2008,1,"Suspend all disbelief. There's not a single element of realism in this movie & it's a very sad attempt to try & make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasn't strong enough.I'd normally class Morgan Freeman & Angelina Jolie as a good cast but sadly they've got awful roles. The script itself is truly dire, based on a comic I've never read or heard of ever.Basically we're in a world of superhero assassins where their abilities are right out of The Matrix. The film borrows heavily from things like Bulletproof Monk (I don't actually think there's a single original idea in the whole movie) and viewers are expecting to suspend way too much belief.The film has too much action (yes, you read that right! Too much!) and suffers in the same way Bad Boys 2 did, just having action scenes for the sake of it because there was no plot or script to follow so they'd just engineer an action sequence for no reason at all than seeing the hero or the other assassins use their magical powers.We're following Wesley Gibson, a nobody who is dragged into the world of the assassins and trains to become one to kill the man who killed his father. Except thats not the case, the man he kills IS his father and the guy in charge of the assassins (Morgan Freeman in possibly his worst movie role ever) has started to create targets for his own profit.The film is truly awful, ignore the plot because it's nonexistent. Enjoy looking at Fox (Angelina Jolie) until she decides to kill herself near the end of the film. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused & his character could have done much more.If you can ignore the ridiculous special effects, CGI and over the top action sequences then you might get a bit of pleasure from watching this. Personally I hated it and if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the best bits of the movie as it really doesn't get any better than the trailer. 2"
What Happens in Vegas             ,nilesh_chouhan,1,comedy,2008,10,"I ended up seeing this film only because Indiana Jones was sold out, but i enjoyed this film so much. I have to admit this is one of the funniest film i have seen this year! A great cast, great acting and non stop funny scenes. I would recommend all to see the film. The story line is a very good one, and superb acting skills of Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher. I could not think of a better couple to play the parts. I did find the ending however a bit plain and simple, but then again the 85% made up for the poor ending. But do not let this put you of, because the this film is a funny one. Cameron Diaz looks amazing, I know a typical guy comment, but it's very true. "
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,dollparts1215,1,misc,2008,6,"If you want a good movie about Henry VIII and Anne Bolyen, rent Anne of the Thousand Days. That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation. In this version of the eponymous Phillipa Gregory novel, historical inaccuracies abound. Approximately fifteen years are compressed into two hours with no indication time has gone by except for various babies. None of the characters ever change or grow any older. The characters in this movie are completely one-sided. Anne is ambitious. Henry is a womanizer. Mary is simple. No one has any complexities. The sisterly rivalry plays out like an underdeveloped soap opera. On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. Same with the gorgeous palace settings. Eye candy it is. Truthful or realistic it isn't. 2"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,JohnLeeT,0,drama,2013,10,"This is a fairly good film with a good cast. However, it is Emily Watson who shines in what good have been a rather insignificant role if not for her utter brilliance. She brings a realistic fire and passion to the role of a protective mother who witnessed the abuse perpetrated by a savagely disordered relative while she was a child. Perhaps what was most interesting about her presence in the film is that she towers over the pathetically inadequate Julia Roberts in talent, depth, and even beauty. Roberts may have an Academy Award (a joke) and Emily Watson may have only been nominated twice (an utter outrage she has not been recognized by the Academy), but pay attention to what they accomplish in their respective parts. Watson is a true actor while Roberts is a mere curiosity in her pitiful attempts to be something other than what she is. It is Watson who the audience can not take their eyes off of and they hang on her every word. While this motion picture is worth seeing on its own terms, it is Emily Watson who makes it memorable and a film with meaning and beaut"
Goodbye Solo             ,craig-windum,0,drama,2009,10,"Absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I had seen the preview, and thought ""oh my, this is going to be a tacky indie flick."" My wife (yes, I love her dearly) dragged me in to see it at SXSW (like she does so often), and I really wanted to not watch it. But from the very first minute, I was utterly captivated. I can't believe how good a small film like this can be!!! I almost cried in the end, and I felt so full of life. It's a powerful film, and I want to see everything this director has made now. The little girl did such a great job <U+0096> I hope she becomes a famous actress because she deserves it. The main character was also really good, and his accent was so well acted (I even wonder if it was real?) I can't say there was a better film at SXSW this year <U+0096> or any year! I've gone many times before, and this one was just shocking. I'm tempted to drive to wherever it's playing (I hear it's getting a limited release in theaters) just to see it again before it comes out on DVD. You must see this film! This director will make it big!"
The Express             ,robertallenandersonjr,,misc,2008,10,"The Express was a wonderful sports movie with lots of drama. It had a ton of emotion and great feelings in it. Me watching the movie I felt like a fan. This movie will make you love sports even if you don't. It was inspirational in so many ways. The whole movie keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat at the end. Each one of the football games were fun and exciting to watch. When their wasn't football in the movie the director found ways to keep the movie good and interesting. This movie had emotion. love, heart, tears, and inspiring moments. Their are many different scenes in this movie that are sad to watch and upsetting for the viewers. The thing that makes it so upsetting for us to watch is the thing they do to blacks in this movie. I think that everyone should see this movie just to see how life was. The life the blacks lived in this movie wasn't good. I think this movie will teach people to respect everyone no matter who it is. This movie was one of the best movies of the year. It was the best sports movie of the year and ever. It will honestly have you on your feet. It was such a great movie and was so inspiring and should be seen by everyone. It was great for kids, teens, adults, and even grandparents. It was so exciting and fun to watch all around. Their weren't any flaws pretty much. The movie has so many different messages that were great. The thing that is mostly the best part of the movie is that Ernie is the most unselfish person on and off the field in this movie. He shows everyone how to be a better person. The coach played by Dennis Quaid did a great job and was a good person and coach as well. The movie was based on a true story also. Overall this is one feel good movie. It is the must see sports movie. Go see it and have a fun time cheering and clapping."
The Dark Knight             ,big_poppa_hnoudis,0,action,2008,8,"I have just come out of the ""Dark Curtain"" Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and I'm blown away.Nolan's directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying ""Now how in the hell did they do that?!"", Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I don't want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding it's release, but it's there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.9/10. 1,071"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,MMcCSLH,0,misc,2008,NA,"I did not see 'Step Up' so I will not base this review on the back of the first one. Somewhat in the same vein as 'Honey', 'You Got Served' (sic) young oriented dance movies, I found the same general feel to 'Step Up 2'. A range of mediocre acting, phenomenal choreography and dancers, simple and predictable plot and morals of the story.Predictability 1- Ballet is boring, it is (usually) depicted as bland and too 'classical' in a film of this genre to young folks. The main character Andie is essentially a street non-professional hip hop dancer, does not know how to interpret the classical music she is given by her teacher, thus continues to do the style of dancing what she normally would to hip hop music; its cute and funny. Later on it shows that all forms of dance make one great versatile dancer.2- Stereotype main character is a White girl. Not too many complains here, because I was surprised to see they did not make it known or emphasis that fact that she was white, who was enthusiastic about hip hop and street dancing. She was just there along with all the members of the '401 crew'.3- Mean black people. This one never fails. We have the angry high tempered black male of 401, and the supportive black girl (Felicia) that always stands behind her friend, but later loses her patience and finally is fed up and gets an 'attitude' (whether constantly covering up for Andie's absences was necessary or not is objective).4- Foreign accent student of any ethnicity. Jenny Kido has funny one liners, although the humor mostly depends and derives from the broken English of said person -- basically doesn't really have any real dialog throughout the whole movie.5- Cute Hispanic girl who from time to time speaks Spanglish. Missy whose family is almost painfully stereotypical, said a few phrases in Spanish in the beginning of the film, and wears stand out looking clothing.This was the first movie I ever saw where I subconsciously knew what was happening next during some moments envisioned in my head, it seemed. Still, 'Step Up 2' was better than what I expected it to be."
The Lucky Ones             ,georgemilojevic,,adventure,2012,5,"there is no comedy in this movie, there is no war but war related, drama maybe but not really. its mostly a road trip movie. That on the side, movie itself is so so. main characters are well developed and acted out. they are well portrait as in a mix mash of 3 completely different ""types"" of soldiers. any other characters involved are pale and not worth mentioning. But that's it for me. Nothing else i found interesting or special about this flick. It is straight forward 90minutes of conversations and couple of situations they run into on the trip. camera work and directing don't bring much to it either. shots of states nature side fill in some blanks but all in all i forget pretty much everything but the characters after movie ended. all in all not a complete waste of time but not really entertaining or emotionally moving. 5/10 is plenty comparing to 7/10 at the momen"
Gomorrah             ,spukmeyer,,crime,2008,3,"In this movie, the camera stands quite motionless contemplating still frames for too long, many things happen too slowly just to let you know that you are not watching an ""hollywood-style"" action movie... The dialogs are natural and punch the reality meter high up, but who says reality is interesting and worth registering into a flick?It seemed to me another pseudo-intellectual exercise, where the authors devote too much time praising their ego than offering an interesting experience to their audience.Don't expect to find anything close to ""Cidade de Deus"" (City of God), where the plot is carefully designed to keep both your intelligence and adrenaline levels satisfied. In ""Gomorra"" you will get the boring part of reality, which I kind of find everyday while I'm awake, so I should not have to pay anything to see it on the big screen. Shaky cams and an uninteresting use of zoom doesn't make it a masterpiece of film making either - nothing intellectual here. The real intellectual exercise that should be made was to offer the reality in an interesting way, so much to keep your intelligence busy and provide the viewer with some feeling of 2 hours well spent.You are not above the common mortal just because you ""say you enjoy"" going through this movie. You are a masochist, or your life is incredibly boring..."
Wendy and Lucy             ,ronnivic,1,drama,2009,10,"It is amazing to me that viewers see this film so differently. The surface plot has been related many times here so not much to add there. I found the movie haunting and thought about it for several days. Because there were so few characters, each was very important from the young man in the grocery store with the prominent crucifix and fallow heart to the terrifying visitor in the woods. The mechanic was an observer who felt no real compassion but am sure he felt himself fair. He was a hard man. I found no fault in Wendy. She kept her sanity and her dignity while suffering body blows. She never abased herself, but carried on. There was something about this story that felt like the darker fairy tales I read as a child. There was no sure light at the end of the tunnel yet, when she told Lucy that she would come back, I believed her. Think I will let this move settle, then watch it again. Michelle Williams is lovely and did a beautiful job with this portrait. I'll look for her in other movies."
Yes Man             ,claudio_carvalho,0,comedy,2009,6,"The banker Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely man with low self-esteem after his divorce with Stephanie (Molly Sims), for whom he still yearns; he avoids his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper); he has a boring job, stalled in a bureaucratic position in the loan department of a bank; and he spends his spare time watching DVDs. When he meets by chance his former high school mate Nick (John Michael Higgins), he is convinced to participate of a self-help program called ""Yes Man"" leaded by the guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). The basic principle of the program is to say ""yes"" to new situations, leaving the negativism aside. Carl misunderstands the concept and says ""yes"" to every question. While leaving the encounter, he helps a homeless man and in the end of the night he meets the gorgeous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) that helps him with her scooter. His life completely changes with his new attitude: he becomes closer to his manager Norman (Rhys Darby) and is finally promoted in the bank; he experiences the most surrealistic and the weirdest situations, and becomes successful and with many friends, until the day that he discovers that sometime a ""no"" is necessary for an answer.""Yes Man"" is a good romance that highlights the importance of changing attitude in life. Carl Allen is a very negative man that has no progress in his lonely life, but when he changes his behavior and becomes a positive man, he achieves love and success. The story has many absurd situations, but is very funny. I like Jim Carrey and this role is tailored for him. The cute Zooey Deschanel shows a great chemistry with him and the result is an entertaining movie with a good message in the end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Sim Senhor"" (""Yes Sir"")"
The Merry Gentleman             ,socrates99,,crime,2009,9,"It's amazing what a good group of actors can do under superior direction. I'd almost forgotten. Usually I favor movies for their story, but this movie's story is a bit light. Still, what's there is made all the more engaging by the terrific performances, starting with the two leads. Kelly MacDonald is especially effective, but so is Michael Keaton who manages to bring some convincing emotional reality to the hit man genre despite having directorial duties to perform as well.The pace is slow but it's rich with detail and nuance to the point you'll feel as if you're really there. Some movie scenes seem to suspend the reality of the camera and lights for those key moments, but here the entire movie seems unusually realistic and unaffected. It's got to be Keaton's doing which makes me hope he finds another project he'd like to tackle soon. Saw this on DVD tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it. Not for the shallow or those only looking for a laugh. Be attentive and respectful and you'll come away a bit better for the experience."
Gran Torino             ,arcticcarrot,0,drama,2009,3,"This movie has so many problems that I'm not sure where to begin. So i'll simply mention things as they come to be, rather than in chronological order. The first thing that has to go from this film is the awful scene at the barbershop where Clint is trying to teach Thao how to interact with people. Awful, awful, awful, and it goes on and on, and then it ends with the lamest joke about anal sex with some carpenters. Actually, all the barbershop scenes can go, because the only thing they accomplish is to show that Clint's character makes racist remarks even with his friends. But we get that from the scene with the Irish foreman. The priest should have been recast. That said, the scene near the end when the priest just walks right into Clint's house is terrible. The whole movie the priest has been calling Clint's character by his first name, and Clint keeps correcting him, asking to be called Mr. Kowalski, and then predictably in this late scene the priest calls him Mr. Kowalski, and Clint says, ""Call me Walt."" Awful. And nothing is accomplished in the scene anyway. The editing is poor also. Scenes that have ended continue for a few more moments. For example, the scene where Sue is being hassled by three black guys is over once Clint gets her into his truck and they drive away. But the scene continues with a crane shot of the three guys walking away and talking about Clint. What do we care what these guys think of him? The scene is over, move on. Okay, now for some real spoilers... The end is completely retarded. Clint's character should not die that way. After all, his standing up to the gang earlier should have empowered the neighborhood to take a stand. They should have reported the names of the guys who raped and beat Sue. Instead, Clint goes on a suicide mission, somehow knowing that only then would people tell the police what's been going on. Someone says, ""This time there were witnesses."" Well, hell, there were witnesses every time, but no one was willing to speak up. Why should they now? It's ridiculous. And then of course the kid inherits the stupid car. Who cares? What he should have inherited was the tools. The tools are what really brought those two characters together; the tools are what will be useful to him in allowing him to get on with his life. The movie is plagued by some of the worst acting i've ever seen in a film. The bit where Thao is locked in Clint's basement and he's demanding to be let out had the whole audience laughing, and it was supposed to be a serious moment. I don't understand why people love this film. My only guess is that the vast majority of film-goers are morons. Oh well. "
Milk             ,richard-1967,0,misc,2008,9,"My wife and I saw Milk yesterday at the Castro Theater in SF -- right around the corner from Harvey's camera shop, where I met Harvey in 1973-4. For those of us who learned from Harvey about what it meant to be gay in America at that time, and who learned genuine acceptance and love, this movie is wonderfully evocative.Harvey Milk was truly extraordinary, as were the times. This film portrays it all, for the most part accurately. Even the dog poop scene (no real spoiler here), which I had forgotten but remembered as soon as the scene began, was dead on. Van Sant is also very faithful to location, which for me, someone who lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, was really wonderful. Events were recreated where they actually happened. Sean Penn wears the same outfits Harvey wore for the Gay Rights Parade and other moments. It's great to see Cleve Jones, still a gay-rights leader, in a ""starring"" role.Why no 10 out of 10? Well, I thought Sean Penn was great, spot on, but it wasn't the earth-shattering performance I expected. Penn absorbed and became Milk, which is what he does so well. No disappointment here, since the role is not earth-shattering. Harvey grew on you; he wasn't Dr. King or Bobby Kennedy.Second and more significant, the parts that weren't so accurate. Most important here, another extraordinary man, George Moscone, relegated to being a reflection of Harvey, told what to do and how to act. Mayor Moscone was not the leader of a revolution like Harvey, but he was an extraordinarily skilled and enlightened man, a full ally of Harvey's, not the implicitly reluctant guy who needed Harvey's push. Nor was Dan White's resignation aftermath completely accurate -- 'nuff said. Moscone too was a hero, and even though the movie was about Harvey, Van Sant would have done better by giving full (albeit brief) honor to George Moscone too."
Good Dick             ,susan_taylor_thomas,1,misc,2009,NA,"I absolutely loved this movie! Pulls me in, every time I watch it! I found myself thinking, how these characters are very much like the people I see around me everyday. Complicated, interesting, emotionally twisted, flawed human beings, just looking to be loved and accepted. Some people, like the character that (Jason Ritter) plays, are an open page when it comes to giving their heart away. Eager to take risks at love, even if that means opening your heart to a load of pain. Like an addict, knowing full well the consequences that will have to be paid seeking out this alluring drug, nevertheless, they are driven to seek it out, like a moth to the flame...Ritters character, has an innocent charm about him. A boyish lovable quality, that is undeniable. You can clearly see the flaws in him, but strangely, you look away, taking a risk on him, in the chance that he will redeem himself once again. He is relentless in his efforts to win the heart and attention of this emotionally damaged, and yet highly intelligent woman. How many people do we know like this is our own lives??? These irresistible charmers that seem to win their way into our hearts against our own better judgment? Palka's character, clearly a highly intelligent woman, who can verbally bash a man into a bloody pulp, has been verbally and sexually abused by her father, since she was a little girl. We later see her emotionally unravel, as Ritters character, bravely tries to pull her out from her isolated world, breaking the routine of her dysfunctional patterns. I am constantly reminded as I watch this film, how real these characters are! They are not unlike so many of the dysfunctional people around us. Misfit, loners, abused and wounded by the predators of this world, left to cope with the damage they leave behind. It takes tremendous courage to open your self up to love and healing, after such abuse and betrayal of trust has been broken. These two characters portray that there is hope in the healing power of love!"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,TwoToneColor,0,animation,2008,1,"The Tale of Despereaux is easily the most disturbing children's movie I've ever seen. I had high expectations, hoping to see a charming movie about a brave little mouse. After about 15 minutes of the movie, I was starting to go numb from the idiocy. As time passed, it got worse and worse. The animation is like a low-budget video game, the story wretchedly stupid from beginning to end (the banning of soup in the kingdom turns everything dry, gray, and depressing), and the characters bizarrely random (the vegetable man/spirit/thingy that the cook talks to). But BY FAR the worst thing was the disturbingly deviant ""morality"" displayed by the characters and shoved down the audience's throats. Don't listen to anyone who claims that this is a deep psychological movie, it's nothing more than abusive fantasies presented as a ""children's"" film.The film presents two of its sickest characters as simply misguided and not responsible for their actions (such as attempted murder) because they were slighted or not pretty or whatever little thing upset them. We're led to believe that sadism and sick obsession are merely mild offenses and that you have the right to commit any crime you like if someone offended you or has something you want. There are no negative consequences to your actions, and the person you inflict the crime against should apologize to YOU because it was all their fault anyway (for being too rich or too pretty or not respecting you enough). Princess Pea is a kind, gentle, pretty young woman who is grieving for her mother (and soup, and rain, etc...). Apparently, though, she isn't good ENOUGH because she is the (supposedly deserving) target of two freaks' sadistic impulses...Roscuro is presented as a decent rat during the first half of the movie. That changes quickly. When he goes to Princess Pea to apologize for her mother's death (who died of a heart attack when Roscuro fell into her soup), he ends up having to flee when she recognizes him and, terrified, throws things at him to protect herself. A normal response to this would be empathy and understanding because the princess has been deeply wounded by her mother's death (of which, Roscuro was unintentionally responsible for). Roscuro's response? Encourage a deranged servant girl to abduct the princess at knifepoint and force her down into the dungeon so she can be devoured alive by the evil rats. Yep. That's it. After he finally decides against the twisted murder (because he decided to ""forgive"" her), the movie has the princess tell him the SHE is the one who's sorry. Huh? Did I miss something? He tried to KILL her for being afraid of him and because he decided against it at the last second, it's her fault anyway because she was afraid of him? Why the heck does she need HIS forgiveness? At the end of the movie, he sails off on a ship, presumably living happily ever after.Miggory Sow is a brooding psychopathic servant girl who, angry that she's not a princess, talks to herself, steals Princess Pea's belongings, violently hacks at a painting of Princess Pea's face with silverware, and finally forces the princess down into the dungeon at knifepoint (you can only imagine what the heck she was planning to do down there). No kidding. The film tries to make you feel sorry for her because she's ugly and poor, but her inner self is far uglier than any outward looks. She acts like a psychopathic neanderthal, who doesn't understand that you're NOT supposed to murder people out of jealousy. The film also tries to make it seem like she was manipulated by Roscuro into the kidnapping, but all it took was a suggestion from him and she was quick to get a meat cleaver from the kitchen and go straight for the princess, repeating to herself over and over ""I... should be... the princess!"" At the end of the movie, she's reunited with her father and lives happily ever after. She doesn't even have a sickening change of heart like Roscuro. We're instead ""treated"" to a scene of the princess, after being freed by Despereaux, apologizing to Miggory and putting her own crown atop the sadist's head. Remember, folks, you must keep the people beneath you appeased so that they don't hack you to pieces in a dungeon.The two psychopaths live happily ever after without any repercussions, as do the other twisted souls of the film... Miggory's father, another angry neanderthal, who throws a helpless Despereaux against a stone wall. Despereaux's mouse community, who sentenced him to a nearly guaranteed death even though he's still a child. His family, who didn't even try to stop them. And so-on and so-forth... It would take hours to list all the things wrong with this movie.The general morality of this film is: You're pretty and I'm not, so I'll murder you. You have something I want, so I'll murder you. You didn't treat me with enough respect, so I'll murder you. By the way, it's your fault. You should apologize to ME and make amends to appease me. It's like watching a film project made by a serial killer on death row.DO NOT take your kids to see this freaky flick."
Nights in Rodanthe             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,drama,2008,6,"Oh, my friend was just dying to see Nights in Rodanthe, I'm convinced she is absolutely in love with Richard Gere, not to mention she just loves romantic movies, so Richard Gere and romance? It's a no brainer, she just had to see this movie, guess who she begged to go with her? Yeah, me, I didn't really want to see it though, it looked too sappy for my tastes, but we got to see it for free, so I figured to just go ahead and give it a fair chance. Well, we saw it today, it was a little better than I expected, which is saying plenty. After seeing the movie Unfaithful, I really wasn't into the whole Diane and Richard being back together on screen, but for some reason they made this story more enjoyable. Even though it was predictable, it was a sweet movie, I hate the sappy movies, despite it's sappiness that I normally resent, it's still a nice movie and was just a breath of fresh air due to the recent movies that we're getting that are either thrillers, comedies, or action.Adrienne Willis is a divorced mother of two who's ex-husband is begging to come back home after a nasty affair he had with one of her friends. She's debating on it since her children want them back together and she feels it should be that way. But when her friend leaves her to run her house on the beach that she rents out to people, Adrienne meets Paul Flanner, a doctor who has had a rough year after loosing a patient on a routine surgery, he's staying in the house with Adrienne. Loosing themselves has been so hard, but when they're together they find themselves once again and bring life back into their world realizing it's OK to be in love once more.Nights in Rodanthe is a nice movie to watch... more so I'd say for either a rental or a matinée, I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be, but it does get predictable, which I hate to say I've just been seeing nothing but predictable films lately. Maybe I should start writing scripts if this is all it takes, I could write a number one movie maybe, wish me luck. But back onto the movie, it has decent acting and does give you watery eyes. It's a nice movie to watch, gives you a little smile and reminds you of the sweeter things in life. Richard and Diane made this movie enjoyable and were lovely on-screen together, it's worth the watch.6/10"
Wendy and Lucy             ,leumas3765,1,drama,2009,9,"Minimalism exists in all art forms, whether it's a painting of a simple geometric shape, a song using only a few repeated notes, or a film that is about a young woman trying to find her dog. Some viewers will miss the point of this and not enjoy the film. While it's true that there is very little background on the main character, the run time is short, and there is not a lot action, these are not the right questions. With minimalism, the question seems to be ""How well can you express something with very limited resources?"" The answer, as it pertains to ""Wendy and Lucy,"" is phenomenally and heartwrenchingly well. The storyline ""A young homeless woman on her way from Indiana to Alaska loses her dog while passing through Oregon. She spends the rest of the movie trying to find it,"" could be the plot for a sappy Disney or Hallmark Channel movie. The genius of this movie is how remarkably un-sappy it comes across. Michelle Williams' portrayal of Wendy, a young member of the invisible underclass of society, left this well-fed and comfortably housed viewer thinking ""Wow. I have no idea if this is what it's like to be homeless, but it absolutely could be."" She catches a break in her search for Lucy and the movie ends in an unexpected way. Days later, I'm still wrestling with whether or not I agree with what she did, and if I would have done the same thing in her situation. Good films make you ask these sorts of questions.Michelle Williams as Wendy is straightforward and sympathetic. Some reviewers complained that her unknown background or poor decisions make it difficult to like her. Others were turned off by the lack of affect the character possesses. I disagree. Wendy is deserving of sympathy if for no other reason than she is actively trying to improve her life by finding a job. When she needs money, she collects cans for the deposit. Even when she needs money a phone call, she offers the security guard change from her car seat for quarters rather than merely asking for money. Her decision to steal the dog food inevitably separates her from Lucy, but are those who would condemn her come across like the ""Real Hero"" teenage clerk who catches her. It's easy to condemn stealing in all instances - but life, as this movie so wonderfully illustrates, is comprised of nuanced shades of grey rather than the black and white we'd like it to be. I was drawn to this movie after hearing about it on the Slate.com critic's ""Best of 2008"" list. Then I read that it was filmed in Portland, my home city, and my interest grew. When I read that it was filmed in North Portland, my old neighborhood, my anticipation ratcheted up to the level of ""must see it in the theater."" As it turned out, a good deal of this movie was filmed two blocks from where I used to live. Big deal, you say? I mention it only to note that the distraction of recognizing scenery and landmarks was probably the only thing that kept me from breaking down and sobbing at this painful exhibition of a young woman's life that must be spot-on for far too many people, and I'm not one who cries at many movies.The only quibbles I have with ""Wendy & Lucy"" are the notion that it is set in a small Oregon town. Would a small town have a security guard outside a drug store, and a sizable homeless population? North Portland (specifically Lombard St. between I-5 and Portsmouth - the site of most of the locations) does have a yesteryear feel to it, but it is certainly not a ""small town."" Locals will also puzzle over why she went 15 miles south to Wilsonville on her way to Alaska and why she went to court in Washington county for an offense committed in Multnomah county, but these are minute gaffs that are probably present in every single movie due to the constraints of securing filming locations.This film is highly recommended, but it absolutely is NOT the ""Feel Good Movie of The Year."" Also, with a run time of only 80 minutes, you may find yourself sad AND wondering what to do with the rest of the evening besides getting that sorrowful tune she hums out of your head."
The Reader             ,ikanboy,1,drama,2009,8,"The story is a simple one, with a twist. A boy has an affair with an older woman, who one day abandons him without a word. A quiet, sensitive boy, in post WW2 Germany. Finding him retching outside her house she takes him in and cleans him up. When he recuperates and comes to thank her, the relationship becomes kinetic.He is educated, she is not. He is innocent, she is not. They make a trade. If he'll read his books of literature to her, she'll please him sexually. He learns little of her, and she doesn't offer much to him, except her body. When he pleads for more, she berates him with: ""you mean nothing to me."" It is a prophetic remark that shows us more of her, but little else is forthcoming, and when he hesitantly asks her if she means it, she seems to grudgingly back down. As it turns out this exchange may be crucial for the boy's, and our understanding of her character.A few years later, when attending a war crimes trial for a class, he is stunned to see his former lover as one of those accused. She was a guard at Auschwitz. The young man is devastated, but holds his silence to his friends. He decides to visit her in jail but backs out. Then he realizes that he has evidence that can change the course of her trial, but continues to keep silent.It is his silence that makes up the core of this movie, and it is it's unraveling that is left to the audience. Is his reason simple or complex? Is he acting out of cowardice, malice, or a sense of justice? As a man (Ralph Fiennes) he one day decides to send her one of the books he used to read to her. But not the book, rather a tape he has made of himself reading the book. He had realized in the trial that the one thing he knew about her, was the one thing that might have given her a more lenient sentence: she is illiterate. How this could have been a mitigating factor I won't divulge.Using his tapes and looking at the books she teaches herself to read, and starts to write to him, but he never responds, continuing his silence, and yet continuing to correspond to her as a ""Reader."" What are we to make of him? Or her? My take on it, is that she was a simple, concrete soul, used to taking orders, and able to separate herself emotionally from her job, yet remaining shallow in spite of all the fine literature she is exposed to. She ends up being able to read, but never able to fathom. She comes across not as callous, but as vapid.He on the other hand comes across as a weak man, unable to grapple with the paradox of loving a ""monster,"" who he never knew as a monster. Unable to offer much except that which he can do at a distance. He is not callous, but is, like his erstwhile lover, emotionally hollow.Winslett is haunting, and emanates pathos. The boy David Kross is winning as a winsome lad. All in all the movie held up well and was engrossing, but I could have done without the final scene with Lena Olin, who plays a victim of the holocaust, imperiously, and unsympathetically, and the scene seems to have had only one purpose: to allow her to get in the pregnant line: ""you can learn nothing from the camps."""
One Missed Call             ,keiichi73,0,horror,2008,1,"Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of ""accident"" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it."
The Bank Job             ,jemps918,0,crime,2008,5,"Having been weaned on The Italian Job, Thomas Crown Affair and the Ocean's 11 series, The Bank Job is glaringly lacking. Set in the 70s and based on a true story of an extraordinary bank heist, it would be understandable if snazzy gizmos and high-tech effects are absent, but the execution could use a lot of help.Martine (Saffron Burrows) is an ex-model who hires her ex Terry (Jason Statham) to rob a bank. Despite having already turned over a new leaf complete with a wife and kid, Terry accepts. He and his team push through with their plan, only they uncover not just material wealth but blackmail-worthy bits of damning evidence as well.There is no charisma between the main characters, between the purported exes and within the thieving team. None of them are even likable so it's a stretch to get the audience to root for them. The end result is dry, when opportunities for a bit more cleverness and wit were rife."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,Skaterever5,1,comedy,2014,1,What a waste of time. I feel cheated out of 111 minutes of my life and i want it back. Definitely not funny and not even a good movie in any other respect. Russell Brand was mildly interesting but it wasn't enough. I can't understand how it could get a 7.3 rating on IMDb except that their must be lot of high people watching and then reviewing it. Find something else to watch and don't trust the inflated ratings on IMDb. And this minimum review length is lame. How long do you need to read that i thought this movie sucks monkey butts? How many ways does it need to be said? This movie gives Jason Segal a really bad name since he is the guy that wrote it (for now he should just stick to acting).
W.             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,misc,2008,6,"Oh, boy, a film about George W. Bush, could be the new ""Forrest Gump"", lol. My head still hurts, because I was just banging it on the wall after I watched this film, how in the heck did this man run our country for 8 years without burning it down? Now I understand why this film was released right before election time, now I work at a movie theater and everyone who came out of the theater said they felt bad for W. and a couple of my friends who I saw the film said they also felt bad for him... how about us?! OK, before I start banging my head up against the wall again, so Oliver Stone is the critical director who decided to take on this wonderful project. The film is actually well made, Josh Brolin does a decent job of portraying our constant dumbfounded president, the story is pretty sad when you think about all the pressures he must face on a daily basis.Based on George W. Bush's life, we go from when he was just a crazy party animal in college. Dubbed as the black sheep of the family, that his brother would be more suited as president, facing constant criticism from his father George Bush, Sr. who was also our president for a short time. We explore W.'s life with his family, his presidency, the pressure he faces, and the Iraq war. We also go into his world of having to pull himself out of his rut with his family who constantly puts him down with a country who is not exactly proud of him as well.W. is a good film, it's well acted and put together, however, my main complaint, but I think there is a reason why, is that Oliver completely skips the election controversy we faced in 2000 as well as 9/11 which I thought was an important subject to touch. But I have a feeling why he didn't bring it up is due to how hard those times were for him and wasn't exactly sure how to go at it. Over all this is a watchable movie, but for me, it is forgettable, I don't know if it will be considered a classic down the line, but I guess we'll find out if our future kids are watching it in their history classes and asking us ""what were you on when you voted for this guy?"".6/10"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,ping411,0,animation,2008,9,"I just got back from an advanced screening of Clone Wars, and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was definitely for the younger crowd, but how is that any different than the rest of the prequels? There were some great action sequences, and the storyline had a few concurrent branches to it, in true Star Wars fashion.Dare I say it, the characters almost had more depth in this cartoon than they did in the movies. There was more banter between the main characters, and even the more elite clones had developed personalities.The art style was pretty cool. Everything looked ""painted"" and not as polished as most CGI movies. Star Wars pioneered the weatherbeaten look in science fiction, and that aspect carried over to the CGI adaptation. My only complaint animation-wise is that the mouth movements of the characters didn't look quite natural, and at times I noticed that it didn't even appear to match the dialog.As a fan, I didn't have that ""what were they thinking?"" feeling throughout the movie. There weren't any ""yippee"" or ""nooooo"" lines in there that made me roll my eyes. The closest thing to it was that the droids were more like the episode 3 goofy variety than the episodes 1 and 2 foot soldier variety. But I was willing to overlook it, and overall their lines were funnier and less annoying than episode 3. The beginning of the movie opened with a narrator, which was a complete departure from the Star Wars model, and it was a little cheesy. It sounded a little too ""WWII Newsreel."" But I was more than willing to forgive its minor flaws in exchange for it being JAR-JAR FREE! Overall, I was pleased. As a stand-alone movie, it was good. As a kickoff to the TV series, it was excellent. I'm looking forward to the season premiere!"
21             ,Rogue-32,0,crime,2008,2,"I was intrigued by the preview of 21 because I'm a sucker for films about gambling, and this is a film about gambling ~ it's the director/writers gambling with our intelligence, hoping we're completely devoid of brainpower, which would make us stupid enough to buy any of the claptrap we see on screen in this bonafide turkey.The beginning is good, it's only when the true fun should be starting - when Ben starts going to Vegas as part of the blackjack team headed by Micky (Kevin Spacey) - that the movie begins to seriously fall apart.Vegas is a huge town, with literally hundreds of casinos, but these clowns wind up going back to the SAME casino, over and over, using the SAME signals to one another (their ridiculous signal to indicate a hot table, for instance), until it's more than blatantly obvious to the security overseer, Laurence Fishburne, that these stooges are playing a very dangerous - and stupid - game.The story then continues on its deathtrail of stupidity, with the storyline and the characters' behavior becoming more and more ridiculous until Ben - duhhhh - loses Everything and has to - double duhhhh - find a way to outsmart Micky (a 2-year-old could outsmart this guy) and get his life back together. The way it's done is even stupider than what proceeds it, what with Ben luring Micky back to the SAME casino for one last shot at the Big Money. ""They'll know us there,"" Micky says, ""So we'll have to wear disguises."" Oh yeah, genius - a cowboy hat and fake mustache really make Spacey look like a totally different person (not), and even stupider --- they show up using the SAME signals that they've used all along; yes, these giboneys are that dumb.Then, to insult the audience even further, the writers tack on what they believe, in their deluded states, to be a double surprise ending. By this time, the only surprise is that anyone is still left in the movie theatre. "
Gomorrah             ,amandola-1,,crime,2008,NA,"I read in previous comments on this page all my thoughts and feelings about Gomorra, it's very difficult to add more... Anyway I'd like to point out something about: this work of Art is halfway between neorealism and epic style, the extraordinary use of lessons taken by best cinema makers in the world, the long sequences recalled me Hitchkock, the ""dollies"" sequences recalled me Sergio Leone, the choice in acting recalled me Ken Loach, the sapience in using noises and music Stanley Kubrick, and definitely the light looks chosen by Rotunno and Visconti; everything makes a no doubt new original artist named ""Matteo Garrone""! Even his springing was with the superb ""L'Imbalsamatore"". I can be not so sure the movie is telling just a ""neapolitan"" story, it tells the Italy's story, where the official life is to a level and the real life to another one. Coppola, De Palma, Scorsese wrote a first part, Garrone finished it. As an Italian I feel deeply ashamed for our industrial class so ""glamoured"" officially (the fashion as the first...) and in reality so involved with criminality. Gomorra is not a ""denounce"" movie, but a ""constatation"" movie."
La siciliana ribelle             ,ricardodiazsoto,1,crime,2010,NA,"While this film adds one of the faces that could easily be overlooked in the saga against the mafia in Sicily, it's just not quite there. The wide shots are typical of setting the scene in different places but the angles are trite and not not reflecting of other realities. Example: A piazza in a small town at mass with 1 or two families? Where are the other extras?The script unnaturally plays to the uninformed audience (why would a prosecutor tell a Palermo policeman how far a town is on the island? Why would the same judge inform, on the way to the courtroom, that the defense has the best lawyers? All are items that could have been interlaced better into the story and thus add the real drama that actually played out. Rita's story deserves to be told and for that the lay audience needs more context but we have lots of real material that could have been unobtrusively added without detracting from the imaginary settings/details.Of course, the film has particular moments of veracity: the hush attitude, the insolent exchanges with police, the Sicilian's simplicity in honor.The film fits in a context of other life to art about the Falcone period"
Deception             ,pdalby-1,0,crime,2008,3,"Went to watch this on opening night - 6 people in the theatre - says it all really. The plot drifts around rather aimlessly ending in a very unrealistic shooting in a city centre where nobody noticed a man being shot and bleeding to death. I'm afraid I fell asleep for 20 mins in the middle but don't think I missed too much. I am a fan of the actors but this movie really does not do them any justice. It would make a pretty good TV movie but thats about all. The story opens up with an interesting premise then drifts for 30 mins or so becoming more and more unbelievable. It is just too long, aimless and without a semblance of realit"
The Square             ,secondtake,0,crime,2012,6,"The SquareIt would be nice to say we need another movie about a small group of working class types all gritty and overflowing with vernacular realism as they get involved in a crime that gets the better of them. ""The Square"" tries to use this common situation and lift it into something we want to watch, and it has the odds against them from the get-go.Put another way--a movie along these lines that does really rise above the expected and penetrate the personalities and the facts might be the movie of the year. Why not? It's not that the material is doomed, but that the things that really matter in a movie--like the writing, the acting, the filming--all have to be spot on and special to make it click. That simply doesn't happen here. As much as you want it to work, you see little plot tricks, small (or large) problems with the script, and decent but routine camera-work and editing bring it crashing down. And the story, because it is so ""usual"" in movie terms, doesn't rescue thing.That's an analysis that avoids the plot, which is about two concurrent money scams. One is apparently very criminal and dangerous, probably drug related, and a bag of money is hidden in the attic. The other is a kickback on a construction job. They connect because the wife of the bag-o-money guy is having an affair with the kickback construction supervisor. After lots of dramatics, some of it nicely done but poorly integrated (I like the picnic scene, which is sixty seconds of good shooting and smart editing), the key protagonists have one final showdown. And a stray bullet makes a mockery of the realism of the rest of it (smack in the forehead).Maybe there is no protagonist. Can you have a movie with three antagonists? It's hard to quite identify with anyone, even the main man running the construction project. This is partly acting and writing, but it's partly just the slightly clunky gluing together of all the parts. The milieu is interesting, the problem dramatic (if a little too obviously sensational), and the intentions sterling. It just doesn't pull together all around. I wis"
The Ruins             ,achimpanzee,,adventure,2008,2,"What makes a ""bad"" film? I will never say ""don't see this film"" because that limits your creative comparisons to others in the industry. The rating you see above (6.5 during this writing) is the most inaccurate rating I have seen on IMDb. The Ruins is simply NOT a good film in any way shape or form.I have never been so extremely disappointed in a movie that seemingly had such potential as this. If I had a choice between seeing this again or Wicker Park (which I always reference as the worst movie ever). Even the nudity (yes, I am a male) was still unnecessary and just pointless. In fact the idea that I'm even reviewing it makes me angry!So anyway here is a very broken down review of the movie. I am not going to go over the synopsis there are plenty of well written summaries already here.Biggest Problem of All: Before you get to the details - there is about 2 minutes of the film actually IN the ruins. That's it. The rest is on TOP of the ruins. At the one-hour mark (which is after the last you see of the inside) I thought ""holy crap"". Astonished, bewildered and just plain depressed I continued to waste another 40 minutes of my life.Acting: Pretty good acting especially the female cast. Kudos to them on working with a horrible script.Plot: The ""idea"" of the film is a great setup. People interacting with a cursed ruins; not completely original but it peaked my interest. However, the writing was 0/10. I cannot emphasize this enough - the writing of this movie, as well as the direction, is some of the worst I have ever experienced (and I have spent years of my life watching countless movies good and bad). Please be aware I have not read Scott B. Smith's novel this is associated with, but if this movie is anywhere along the lines of the book then Scott Smith should be banned from the silver screen ever again. The reason is primarily inconsistencies, lack of climax, and extremely horrible ""resolution"" to the film.Character Development: Absolutely none. Even afterwards I don't know crap about who anyone is, nor do I care. You can't identify with anyone, and you don't even remember their names afterwards. Just plain bad!Musical Score: This is easy - there is none. Oh sure there is a cello here and a few drums there. But just listen during most of the film...silence. Music is what drives human emotion, it has been a part of civilization since the dawn of mankind. Why remove that from films? No idea. Ask Carter Smith and whoever else is responsible.Plethora of flaws: To make this short here are the major flaws I found in this film which is what destroyed its ability to ever be considered a decent film (please revisit after viewing):<U+0095> When their friend is shot in the first 20 min of the film nobody seems to care. They scream for about 10 seconds and then act as if it was 10 years ago. The girls shed a tear or two but the guys seem to say ""oh well"". <U+0095> The ""doctor"" of the group knows all about infections, yet he doesn't give instruction to his friends who pick up the Greek with the broken back 3 feet off the ground by his legs/torso. I mean seriously? <U+0095> Who goes to an ancient ""Mayan"" ruin without flashlights, radio's (non cell-phones dummies), water supplies, food and proper gear. I have never been to such a place but you better be sure I would at least have a flashlight and some batteries! <U+0095> If I were a girl and I was sleeping on top of some ruins after my friend died and another man was paralyzed, I wouldn't sleep in my panties. There are all kinds of strange men with weapons around you - why would you want to sleep in next to nothing? <U+0095> Apparently there is only one side to the ruins since there were about 15 guys out there, but no sign of anything on the other side. Guess production costs were too high and they couldn't construct a fully 3 dimensional prop. <U+0095> Quote: ""Four Americans just don't' disappear"". Yes, I too am American, yet I would never even concoct that phrase in my head in time of crisis. <U+0095> So they cut of a guys legs to ""save"" him, but then in the next scene he is laying there, with open wounds, while dust blows into what remains. Real smart Doc. <U+0095> The horrible one liner ""Well at least we cut his legs off"" about 1 min. after the guy dies. Sigh... <U+0095> So the guy that is paralyzed from the waist down gets a bit to bite down on while they cut off his legs, yet the girl they cut open with a knife just sits there watching and eventually screaming while the ""doctor"" sticks his dirty fingers into her wounds. Yea that makes sense.Ending: Very ""slapped together"" as if they cut it down after-the-fact just to rush production. 'Nuff said.In conclusion: see this film but only over a friends' house that treats you to the rental fee. I would still suggest you see something that actually makes your heart rate raise even 1 BPM over your resting rate. At least then you'll be 1 more above what I was during this film. I could go on for another 10 pages but if anyone is still reading this they either have a lot of patience or agree with me. If you agree with me, I am sorry to hear you wasted your time on the film as well."
Garden Party             ,datorsiers2,1,drama,2015,NA,"Even the rating of 5.7 for this film is a little too much. It is very poorly made as there is no premise, no action and no goal. Just a mixture of showing completely irrelevant characters living their lives, without much action. I almost felt that it was a horrible attempt of trying to compare itself to Pulp Fiction, of course was nowhere close to the classic.I wonder why is the movie called ''Garden Party'', yes, there was a garden party, which was only showed for like 30 seconds and was absolutely irrelevant to the film. Because of the song that kid made? Anyways, not enough to name the movie after that.Since it failed to make me care about the characters, i could not find it appealing to me in any way and got bored very quickly. This movie is only 88 minutes and that just shows you, that no matter how short the movie is it can be extremely boring if there is no action and no goal.The script is just weak, hence making the characters not look good even if they were not performing horribly. Anyways, dull conversations, no goal, no action, weak plot - borin"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,moviemanMA,0,drama,2008,10,"Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish. 5"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,dbborroughs,0,animation,2008,9,"Okay we applauded at the end and I got teary at times.I have no idea when I last saw an animated film this complex made in the US. I mean that in a good way. I also have to wonder when was the last time I saw a real meaty fairy tale on screen, Strings perhaps (oh what a great double feature that will be) How the heck do I explain this simply? I have no idea. Perhaps by saying this is the story of a mouse named Despereaux who isn't afraid of anything, who reads the stories of a knights and chivalry and takes an oath to be a gentlemen, who helps a princess trapped in a castle and a kingdom caught in gloom.One of the most beautiful animated films, possibly the best looking computer animated film yet with a lush scheme that makes it look like various paintings by people like Vermeer. At other times this is the equivalent of book illustrations come to life. As good as the trailers look the film itself is even better. If you love art (both fine and animated, see this film since the film references numerous works.For the most part this is a beautifully adapted film that is like curling up with a good book.Where recent films like City of Ember or Twilight or even the Harry Potter films have links to their source novels that make them less then stand alone movies, this film takes the book and puts it on the screen and doesn't dumb it down or make it so you need to have read the book. You have real fleshed out characters of surprising complexity (What is a character like Dustin Hoffman's doing in a film that is ""for children?"" I don't care frankly because its wonderful). These are not one note sketches but living breathing people. It doesn't rush things, this is a film that takes its time telling the story and requires you actually pay attention. Despereaux doesn't show up for at least fifteen minutes as we get a long run up of why things are the way they are.Its wonderful since it beautifully lays out the world we are walking through. Its a real fairy tale movie that is much more complex than anything that Disney has been churning out, or even Pixar with the film juggling several story lines- Despereaux,Roscuro(Hoffman), the maid, the Princess- all at the same time all seeming to get an equal amount of weight to their telling. It wonderful.Unfortunately the film has one flaw that keeps it from being perfect.(This is a POTENTIAL SPOILER so you may not want to read this bit) There is a moment or two after the meeting of Roscuro and the Princess when the climax of the film is set in motion when it felt like something was left out. How does all of the villainy transpire? Its not fully clear and on some level I couldn't completely go with it to the next level. Its like coming to a canyon and you have to bridge it, but you suddenly find yourself on the other side without knowing how you got there. its the sort of thing that made the almost 10 out of ten film closer to 8 out of 10. (END OF SPOILER) Yes I really liked it. Yes I think you should see it, especially if you like really good fairy tales or stories that are not simple or simplistic. Its a wonderful movie."
The House Bunny             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,1,comedy,2008,6,"Let me just say that I'm 19, a guy, and straight, and DAMN was I having a great time watching The House Bunny. To sum it up, THB is basically an Adam Sandler movie for girls, with Anna Faris breathing life into an otherwise flat movie with her uncanny comic ability and unbeatable charm. In short, she makes the movie watchable, and in some moments, likable and entertaining.I see this film as one that most will easily dismiss without a second look, and I really discourage you from doing that. Anna Faris alone deserves your attention in this movie, as she is brilliant. I even heard a few people in my theater say that she could get a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy. I honestly wouldn't be surprised. She's lovable, adorable, intelligently stupid, and of course, roll on the floor hilarious. She's the reason the Scary Movie series is so much 'better' than the other movies in that series (Date, Superhero, Epic Movies), and her charm and charisma carries over here.In addition to Faris, the strength of the film is the supporting cast (except Hugh Hefner, who gets a pass for simply being Hugh Hefner). The funny thing is, most of the performers aren't even actors. I'm not going to lie and say Rumer Willis is brilliant, because she's not, but she's funny and is good looking enough to surprise us. Katharine McPhee doesn't get enough screen time, but she does do a great job with what she's given. The last of the 'non-actors' is the frontman for The All American Rejects, Tyson Ritter, who is tolerable in a bit part.Now, unsurprisingly, the best supporters are Kat Dennings and the WONDERFUL Emma Stone (Jules from Superbad). Stone is so likable and adorable that she's the best character in the movie after Faris. Colin Hanks is...well, I for one was surprised that he did this movie, but he was an asset nonetheless.I'll go ahead and get my complaints out now. First and foremost, whoever edited this movie is absolutely terrible. Whether it be changing hairstyles, continuity errors, or bad cuts, the editing is noticeably bad, especially towards the end. I also didn't like the direction the script took in the end, as it turned the film into a parody of itself (which was weird considering the entire film was a parody of stupid girls and stupid men), and displayed several out of character moments. The jokes were a tad lame and predictable outside of Faris's character (there was NOTHING bad about her), but it was okay. There were some smart jokes that actually took some time to get.The final plus for this movie is that it is LOADED with cameos. Since you know who the production company is, you already know the group that will be appearing, plus a surprise appearance from 2 NFL quarterbacks (one retired QB, and one current) in the beginning. All in all, The House Bunny is surprisingly funny, all because of Anna Faris and Emma Stone, both of whom have very bright futures ahead of them. Faris is definitely one of the funniest ladies alive. 1"
Adoration             ,janschbern,0,drama,2010,5,"There is not much to say about this convoluted story. Its based on a real event. It relies on lots of talk and minimal action. Atom Egoyan had full control in making this film, from writing to direction. The main pluses are the performances of the principal three of the principal actors. The main negative is the questionable use of ""technology"", particularly of teenage chat rooms, of older people chat rooms, of video cell phones and so on - the focus of these internet & tech based products is to present talking heads by other means. There is also a violin, which is the one major non-tech focus of the story.There is no doubt that this film has potential. It has the making of a compelling plot, given its built in twists, turns and periodic surprises. Could it have been presented in a more exciting and direct way? Maybe not given budget considerations, which are so obvious.At an early point, the movie takes on that feeling of seeming to go on and on and on. But, there is an interesting, underlying story. And Egoyan is a skilled and always worthwhile filmmaker. So, one persists watching, with some judicious use of occasional fast forwarding of the DVD (particularly the seemingly endless, ridiculous multi-channel computer talkfests). The film has craft and is a serious endeavour. But in the end, it is boring. And boring is boring."
Stop-Loss             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,drama,2008,7,"I didn't really know what to expect from Stop Loss, it was just playing at the theater that I worked at and I figured I would go ahead and check it out. So I saw it last night and I have to say that this was seriously one of the most depressing movies of 2008. I went away from this movie just feeling so sad and extremely low, which threw me off on the film. I'm not a supporter of the war in Iraq, I do have 2 cousins and a few friends who are fighting this war and I hate it, so seeing this movie just reminded me even more of that hatred I have. See, the thing is, is that this movie is a reminder to most people why war is Hell and also why they hate what's going on. While I appreciated Kimberly's message to us and reminds us of the pain these soldiers are going through, the story just remains in a biased plot of the constant battle against terrorism.Brandon has just come home from Iraq and is just enjoying his Texas life with his best friend, Steve, and his other friends. They're drinking, flirting, and partying. But the war has ultimately gotten to them, they're hallucinating, hitting their wives, and are just going crazy. When Brandon is called for Stop-Loss, where he has to go back to Iraq when he was supposed to stay home, he understandably gets angry and runs for it. He tries to head for the border, but realizes that maybe his team needs him.Stop Loss is a decent movie and it does have a very powerful message, while I always agree that a war movie is going to be very deep, I think this movie went a little further and could have been lighter, but that's just my opinion, I would have done the story a little different. I also understand Kimberly's message, she meant well with this movie, I think it doesn't work as well as her movie, Boys Don't Cry, but Stop Loss is definitely worth a watch. Ryan Phillipe is becoming a fine actor and holds the film very well, Channing Tatum does alright, enough to keep the film going. The story is a little much, but I think this is one movie you're going to have to judge for yourself.7/10"
Flash of Genius             ,dpaq,0,misc,2008,10,"I saw the Premier of Flash of Genius tonight... I don't know what I was really expecting, but the emotions this movie takes the viewer on are wild.It's a common David vs. Goliath type movie, and it shows that a huge corporation will do everything in it's power to stomp on the little man. What is so emotional is the length one man goes to for something he invented. He sacrificed his family (marriage and all) to prove he was wronged, and ultimately, won. (But with a very high cost) I don't know about anyone else, but I don't think I will buy a Ford anytime in the future.I think a best actor nomination is deserved beyond a doubt. Greg Kinnear has proved what an amazing actor he truly i"
Goodbye Solo             ,fnorful,0,drama,2009,8,"I saw this in the ""Someone to Watch"" and ""American Independents"" sidebars at the 33rd Cleveland International Film Festival.Ramin Bahrani's work improves dramatically with this story of a Senegalese cab driver trying to make a life in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The story arc of his relationship with William, a fare who contracts for a one-way ride a couple of weeks in the future is well-drawn and quite satisfying. All of the prime relationships in this story are deftly developed: Solo's quest to ""save"" William (from what is clearly a suicide trip), Solo's efforts at providing for his second family (with concomitant tension from Wife #2), the effect of step-daughter (?) Alex on William, William's mystery relationship to the young man selling tickets at the local multi-plex.The film was excellent technically. Bahrani likes ""dark"", yet the framing and focus provide for a nice intimacy with the characters. The ""money"" scene at the end (not giving away the plot here!) is beautifully framed, raw, elemental, vertigo-inducing without looking down.Having not liked Man Push Cart (his first film) I feel that with this movie I have found a middle ground with Bahrani: I cared about the characters and I was told a story. But Bahrani likes mystery. And here there is a lot of mystery, very satisfying mystery. Worth seeing twice (which I did!)."
Death Race             ,lastliberal,0,action,2009,7,"There is no one I would rather see in an action movie than Jason Statham. Put him behind the wheel of a car and you have a formula for thrills and excitement that cannot be beat, even if it is on a track that resembles the boring NASCAR.Statham is his usual cool and tough self in this film which really doesn't have a lot to offer outside the race itself. Pairing him with Natalie Martinez just makes me want to know when her next movie is going to be made. She was so hot.There were other great performances from Joan Allen, Ian McShane, and Tyrese Gibson.There was also a very satisfying ending - but you knew that was comin"
The Brothers Bloom             ,RyanCShowers,1,action,2010,NA,"Rachel's role, Penelope, in The Brothers Bloom is far from her Oscar-winning effort in The Constant Gardener, but she elevates her role putting herself on par with Tessa Quale. Weisz steals the show here in a fun, energetic, elaborate tale, The Brothers Bloom. You'll be bouncing out of you seats watching this film. The script is absolutely hilarious, the director moves fast keeping the material alive, and the performances are classy and strong, but what guides The Brothers Bloom (besides Weisz, of course) is the explosive editing. It's hyperactive, but not obnoxious. It's cool , fun and hip.Like I've stated before, Weisz steals the show. Her character Penelope is one of the most memorable and well-written characters in recent memory and Weisz is up to the challenge of taking on that role. She's the most interesting character so you immediately take a liking to her. She's so adorable as the bright, lovely character, but the great thing about her performance is underneath all that lies great sorrow. The rest of the performances aren't too shabby either. Adrien Brody is very good and convincing but it over-towered, by the other more colorful characters. Mark Ruffalo is charming and a ridiculous ball of fun. Rinko Kikuchi has almost no lines, but still gets big laughs. There are dazzling visuals including some gorgeous costumes and set designs. This is a very funny film. Top that with the amount of energy and entertainment throughout, you're in a for a fantastic thrill ride. Not to mention the glorious performances, especially form the magnificent Rachel Weisz. A delightful thrill ride and the best comedy of 2009; 9"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,richard-1967,0,adventure,2010,9,"We saw this as part of a preview cinema club we belong to. And we're happy we did.The Road Movie is one of Hollywood's long-standing (some would say overused) idioms. From It Happened One Night through Butch Cassidy, Bonnie & Clyde, and Thelma & Louise, to Little Miss Sunshine, good road movies can be a joy. Bad ones, though, are a major drag.This is a GOOD road movie. Three things make it special. First, it's about three losers, or -- let's just say it -- weird people. None of these characters start out with much appeal (except Kristen Stewart's great looks), but each grows right in front of our eyes throughout the movie. By the end, we like and find ourselves rooting for each, for different reasons. (In this way, the film reminds me most of the wonderful Hackman/Pacino 1970s vehicle Scarecrow, a much under-appreciated film.)Second, there is splendid acting throughout. Kristen Stewart is headed for stardom, William Hurt does justice to a role only Jeff Bridges could play as well (have we forgotten what a great actor he is?), and the most surprising piece, young British actor Eddie Redmayne, does a terrific turn as a strange kid with a car.Third, there's the film's perspective, about tolerance, acceptance of things as they are, and forgiveness -- for loved ones and above all for ones self.Watch it!"
Death Race             ,NolanSorrento,0,action,2008,7,"2012 the economy has hit bottom, broke through and has kept on descending. Along the way prisons have been handed over to the private sector that have chosen to make a profit by broadcasting gladiatorial style death matches starring the inmates, with the reward to the inmates after 5 victories <U+0096> FREEDOM Enter Jensen Ames (Jason Stratham) a recently unemployed steel worker and former race car driver who lost his license but no matter how bad things are, he's a happy man as long as he has his family.That is, until he's set up for the murder of his wife, imprisoned, and forced to compete in Death Race if he ever hopes to see his daughter again.But enough of the plot! A paragraph blurb at the start and 8 minutes of character development is pushing the limits of this flick and that's not why a person would see a W.S. Anderson/Jason Stratham action flick and besides, a plot would allow ""plot holes"" and who needs to deal with that headache? The rest of the movie takes place in the 3 days of Death Race. The first 2 days are competition/elimination rounds reminiscent of Mario Kart as if it was designed by some rogue member of GTA on a disgruntled day but who loved the hidden short cuts and power-ups.Amongst all the adrenaline filled action, Anderson makes sure to toss in the occasional character development or when he's feeling really daring he'll toss in some pseudo-dramatic realization our hero comes across which helps remind the movie-goer that the movie has a plot rather than just a string of explosive action sequence. All of this is done with the utmost use of cliché and designed to inspire the excitable little 12 year old boy in many of us to stay riveted in our seats as we wait for Jensen to strike with angry revenge for all he's been through.The movie is everything a modern day movie aficionado should not like. It's brainless, sexist, ridiculously violent, and lacks any redeemable qualities. These are also all the reasons why I had so much fun with the movie. I went seeing what I expected and that's exactly what I wanted to see! 1"
The Strangers             ,drkpenguin,,horror,2008,1,"Well, the only good thing was that they were killed. The guy didn't know how to load a shotgun? C'mon! Not to mention he put all the shells in his jacket pockets, then HE TOOK HIS JACKET OFF and left it in the bedroom! The shotgun apparently is a retarded model because he kept reloading after every other shot.Instead of hiding in the closet with his girlfriend and the shotgun pointed at the door, lets run amock, get hurt, and when the situation turns bad, lets split up i'll go into the dreary dark shack 100 yards away from the house, and leave you alone in the un-secured house.They deserved what they got."
Igor             ,Chrysanthepop,0,animation,2010,NA,"It's a shame that this little film did not receive the deserved acclaim. Anthony Leondis's 'Igor' may not tell a story that is completely original but it's a nice and fun adaptation of Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'. It has all the ingredients of an amusing adventurous animation film. The atmosphere and colour created by the vivacious animation draws the viewer and the colourful characters keep one involved. The actors that include Steve Buscemi, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Sean Hayes, John Cleese and Jennifer Coolidge, behind the voices of the characters do a remarkable job. Coolidge is particularly hilarious with her weirdly funny accent as Heidi. Writer Chris McKenna does a very good job in adapting the story and making it lighter in order for it to appeal to children as well. However, I must add that the film is targeted at the young adult audience than children because many of the jokes are for 'grown-ups'. That does not mean that children will have less fun. Even though McKenna has made some big changes from the original, the heart of the story pretty remains the same even though this one ends on a more positive note with a different message. However, perhaps as a result, the story sometimes lacked in depth and a few little things remained unexplored. Yet, this flaw is very minor and doesn't ruin 'Igor' from being wholesome family entertainmen"
The Escapist             ,standeman1984,,crime,2008,9,"As one reviewer said, this is an existential puzzle box of a movie, the true meaning of the title being revealed at the very end. It's not just about escaping from a prison, nor is it a pretentious metaphor. Its just very very well made.I appreciate some similarities with Shawshank Redemption for obvious reasons, but really this film stands up on its own rights. The reasons for escaping are wholly different - SR was to right a wrong while here it is familial breakdown and taking responsibility for ones own actions. Brian Cox's character, and the rest, are believable and fleshed out enough to engage with but the real achievement here is in the pacing and structuring of the plot.The film cuts between the actual escape itself and the events and planning leading up to the escape. Dominoes, diamonds, and of course, drugs all play a part in the set-up of the escape, which plays out with breathless excitement. The grim presentation of the prison, Damien Lewis' character in particular, appears shockingly believable. Prisons are not ruled in the way they should be, and a character like his, having a grip over the institution rather than the other way round, seems sadly truthful. He is very scary...The end, like Shawshank, is uplifting in a downbeat kinda way. It reminded me of The Descent, which i hope is not a great spoiler for people. I almost cried but actually you're left feeling quite happy for the central character. There is not the same redemption as SR, which is a good thing, so don't go in expecting happy endings, or heaven forbid, Prison Break The Movie. For that it is not, though its existence probably owes something to the success of that over-running TV show, and the ingenious escape route is one Michael Schofield would be proud of. But really, this is a great little indie movie which came and went at the cinema very quickly, but will no doubt find an audience in the years to come."
The Reader             ,aharmas,1,drama,2009,10,"Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience. Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"", a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins, and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices are carry a bigger weight than others. The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film, get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters. Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but her manipulations provoke her desired effects. As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again, and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives. In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture, every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and bewitching, the work very few people are able to do. ""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes that might break whatever little strength we might still have left. ""The Reader"" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and intelligent films can be. 1"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,Zen416,1,adventure,2008,1,"Kids movies are supposed to be tolerably fun even if they're lacking in plot but this one is a complete stinker. Why talented people like Jamie Lee Curtis and Edward James Olmos even agreed to be in this rubbish is beyond me. The storyline was forced and stupid and the attempts at humour were bogus and insulting. Thank God there are other ""family friendly"" films available out there like the recent ""Wall*E"", ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Spiderwick Chronicles"" that are worth paying for at the theatres. This might make an amusing half hour segment on some cable network like Animal Planet but that's about it. Avoid this one unless you're a die-hard Chihuahua fan. "
Twilight             ,icy_kate,1,misc,2008,2,"First of all i just want to say that i have read the book about a few days before watching the movie. The book is amazing and recommend it to anyone out there. Now thats been said, in my opinion the movie is absolutely horrible.I didn't see the movie in theaters, and i'm so glad i didn't. There is no clear storyline whatsoever. After watching the first 25 minutes, i felt as if someone had cut the scenes before they had ended. In fact i had asked my friend if this version was in somehow edited by a teenage boy. The movie is so awkward i just felt like laughing. Where Bella sees the police car she says 'what is going on' as if she is reading from the script. I felt like i was watching some depressing parody of the movie instead. Kristen looked depressed in this whole movie, no facial expressions whatsoever! I think she might have smiled once throughout this whole movie. When she goes to his parents house, her acting is even more unbearable. The cast of Edward's family is very well done, and at least they know how to act. Rob was good, except i could do without the pasty make-up job.WATCH THIS MOVIE. You will laugh. Its just so funny. I can't wait until another sort of 'scary movie' comes out and they take their time to disregard all the other movies this year and do twilight. Hahaha Choppy scenes, horrible acting, and the graphics? WHATS UP WITH THAT? Take that Catherine Hardwicke! REMAKE PLEASE?"
The Objective             ,Siamois,,horror,2008,5,"The Objective is, in many ways, reminiscent of science-fiction movies of old, particularly the 70s. But whether it was intentional of Daniel Myrick or it simply is a coincidence, I wouldn't know. One thing is for sure, the real magic and strength of older science-fiction classics is not fully conjured here.This small-budget movie's premise is simple but opens many possibilities. An elite military commando is sent on a mission in the tensed, war-torn present-day Afghanistan. They are led by a mysterious government operative. Their ""Objective"" is relatively unclear but considering the risks taken, the stakes must be high. As the story unfolds, the mystery remains and the plot thickens but we are still left with a sour taste as the development and tension doesn't pay off much.There's a mish-mash of elements here that have been a success in other works and movies. Shades of The Andromeda Strain. Shades of Aliens. Shades of Space Odyssey, of Altered States and of old Bermuda Triangle Movies. More than anything, with just a little rework, this could have been a solid X-Files movie. CIA agent Ben Keynes could easily become FBI agents Mulder and Scully, which would have made things much more dynamic.One of the biggest problem The Objective suffers from is an underdeveloped protagonist and cardboard peripheral characters. One of the secrets to the success of Aliens is that James Cameron, in a much busier storyline, was able to present his space marines as more than mere Alien-hamburgers. In just a few lines, or a few silent frames, we are exposed to colorful personalities and the various interactions between them. In The Objective, not only are the special force members absolutely bland, but they don't even interact in interesting ways with the plot or the main character. When a film-maker introduces characters that are obvious plot tools, I call this weak film-making. But when such characters aren't even effective tools, I call this awful film-making. And that's unfortunately the case here.As for the actual plot... suffice it to say it is intriguing. A few hints are given here and there in the movie that might help figure out what the shocking resolution means. We are firmly in speculative science-fiction at times, much like old sci-fi. This makes this flawed movie a valid entry for fans of the genre but others would be better off passing.This is still a solid effort by Daniel Myrick and commendable on an $8,000,0000 budget. But it seems a less ambitious, more tightly knit plot would have been preferable over too large a scope."
21             ,rhstoo,0,crime,2008,8,"I had the really cool opportunity to see an advance screening of ""21"" tonight. Having read the book when it first came out, I was a bit skeptical about whether it would translate well. I couldn't have been more pleased. Was it the same as the book? Of course not (except for The Green Mile, what was?) But it was action-packed, smart, fun, well-acted, well-directed, and just plain enjoyable. Spacey, Fishburne, and Bosworth are at the top of their games and Jim Sturgess is going to be a star. The visuals were great, the editing sharp, and the score right on point. I don't know whether to stay up all night re-reading the book or hop on a plane for Las Vegas to try to win while I still halfway remember the counting system. I enjoyed this as much as any light fare I have seen in a long time. I love George Clooney, but ""21"" is an order of magnitude better than any of the ""Oceans"" movies. "

I've always admired their humor and their fun, and I enjoy something with a decent lesson or value that kids can learn. I was thoroughly impressed with this movie. This took a while to develop the story, but I believe it really made for their best feature, and some of the best work they've done to this point.I would always stack their animation against pretty much anyone animating today, and their humor and fun really come out.

The Secret Life of Bees             ,sonya90028,1,drama,2008,10,"The Secret Life Of Bees, is a marvelous new drama. It's focus is 13-year-old Lily Owens (played with a deft emotional range, by Dakota Fanning). The film takes place in 1964 in the southern US, during the birth of the civil rights movement.Lily is haunted by the fact that she accidentally shot her mother, when playing with a pistol as a toddler. She also develops a strange affinity for bees, which is bewildering to her. Lily's violent father is abusive towards her. The Owen's black housekeeper Rosaleen, is a mother figure and confidante to Lily.One day, Lily goes to town with Rosaleen, when Rosaleen plans on registering to vote. Racist white men confront them, taunting Rosaleen. When Rosaleen refuses to tolerate their behavior, the men give her a vicious beating. The police soon intervene. Rosaleen is arrested, and held in custody at the medical ward of the local jail.Outraged at what happened to Rosaleen, Lily goes to the jail and frees Rosaleen, before the guards find out. Lily and Rosaleen then hit the road, leaving Lily's brutal father far behind. The two come upon a store in a small town, which stocks jars of honey. Intrigued with the unusual labeling on the honey jars, Lily asks the clerk where the honey comes from. She's told that the Boatwright sisters make the honey. Lily then asks the clerk, where they can find the Boatwright sisters. And she's told that they reside in a huge, 'bright pink' house, a 'ways up the road'. So, Lily feels strangely compelled to find the Boatwrights, for reasons that she doesn't quite understand. After traveling a long way, Lily and Rosaleen spot a bright pink house, in a remote area. Tired, hungry and needing shelter, they knock on the door of this house. The three women who answer introduce themselves as the Boatwright sisters, named May, June, and August.At first, the Boatwrights are reluctant to take in Lily and Rosaleen. They relent, when they realize that the two have no where else to turn. August, the eldest sister, lets Lily become their beekeeping apprentice. Rosaleen is allowed to stay on as the Boatwright's housekeeper. While living with the Boatwrights, Lily unravels the mysteries of her dead mother. Much to her astonishment, Lily discovers how the Boatwrights are deeply involved in her mother's past.Above all, this film celebrates love, and its power to transform human lives in amazing ways. The brilliant performances by the female leads, make this movie the gem that it truly is. Films with strong, positive women in leading roles, are still not as common as they should be. The Secret Life Of Bees, is a powerful film that's heartrending, uplifting, and a definite must-see."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,rebwt,1,misc,2008,6,"Overall, the movie is entertaining. I thought the acting was good, particularly Scarlett Johansson's. The cinematography and editing leave much to be desired, and the entire movie seems rushed. If you have any knowledge of Tudor history,you will recognize the many inaccuracies, but those did not bother me as much as did the fact that important characters were omitted, undeveloped, or even seemingly forgotten (as in the case of Mary's husband, William Carey).There ARE very affecting characters and scenes, but I left the theatre wishing for MORE. The fascinating lives of these people simply cannot be dealt with in a movie that lasts less than two hours. "
35 Shots of Rum             ,klaus_rieser,0,drama,2012,NA,"Contrary to another review here I found the film very enjoyable and interesting, although for the same reasons ;-) In my view, the film establishes the relationships among its central characters, in particular father (Lionel) and daughter (Josephine) through their actions, everyday behavior and their various looks (gazes, glances, observations). The way I read it (but the beauty of the film is in part that multiple readings are possible) it is mostly about the letting go of father and daughter, a musing on the ""Father of the Bride"" theme; in total contrast of course to the comedies of that title.Indeed the film has hardly any plot but interior developments; hardly any action, but a lot of movement; hardly fun but great possibilities of enjoymen"
The Burning Plain             ,chicagopoetry,1,misc,2010,6,"It's hard to follow The Burning Plain because it shifts through time without any warning. We don't figure out until mid-film that this character is actually the grown up version of that character and so forth. This is a rather slow drama saved by the acting talents of two professional actresses, Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger. I find it pretty weird that I didn't discover until 2010 this film starring these two superstars that was made in 2008. It's a statement about how hard it is for indie movies to get any exposure in this market dominated by big budget blockbusters. The theaters are owned by a monopoly and the little movie simply doesn't have a chance these days. It is sad and it is killing the art of film-making. Jennifer Lawrence is simply astonishingly beautiful which doesn't make watching this movie any less pleasant. We never get a clue about exactly how the White breast cancer survivor gets involved with the Mexican farmer thus putting into play the tragedy that ultimately occurs, and at times the interaction between characters is unrealistic. I mean, really, if a group of white kids came to a Mexican funeral and started shouting ""wetback I hope you rot in hell"" are we really expected to believe there wouldn't be some conflict following, at least a few nasty words exchanged? But the brooding mood is quite consistent and watching The Burning Plain won't leave you cheated in any way. If you like serious drama, this will be your cup of te"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,jemps918,0,animation,2008,9,"Thank God the sequel to 2005's ""Madagascar"" turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. Part Twos are usually scary territory, but I daresay this one outdid its predecessor in terms of storyline and packing in the laughs.It starts where Madagascar One ended: Central Park Zoo animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) find themselves still stranded and eager to leave the island. The penguins have built a plane and successfully take off for NY when they crash land in the African wilderness. The NY Zoo animals try to fit in with their wild counterparts and encounter situations that challenge their friendship.Of course King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), the surprisingly scene-stealing granny and the rest of the supporting cast provide added hilarity and wit to almost every repartee. Even more welcome was the relevant uplifting theme, which served as an effective sub-plot, an important message delivered in a fun, non-preachy way. If they intend to rollout a Part Three, this would be a tough one to beat!"
Changeling             ,joestank15,1,misc,2008,9,"Changeling - In 1928, Single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home one day to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. She calls the police and, after enduring a grueling 24 hours, they search for her son. But the boy they return to her is not her son. After confronting corrupt city authorities, Collins is vilified as an unfit mother and sent to an asylum.This is a grueling film to watch. I have not felt this hideous since North Country, a film which also dealt with misogyny within the power structure. Women are treated as fragile, emotional, and not believable. This film tackles corruption to boot, as the LAPD is accused of being a gang of thugs that answer to no one. Eastwood is old school with the violence, understanding that the mind can fill in the very brutal gaps.Angelina Jolie delivers another great performance. But unlike A Mighty Heart, this film actually deserves her presence. I don't think she really should have so much press coverage, but there is definitely reason for her acclaim as an actress. The situation her character goes through is so surreal and the film captures it perfectly. It gives you chills from the second Christine is given this pretender to raise and rarely lets up. And if for one moment you tell yourself ""It's just a movie"" as I tried to, this s*** actually happened. Characters were composited or changed, a disclaimer at the end states, but the events were the same.An odd praise goes out to Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott, a kidnapper and murderer of many children. He has played one of the monsters of everyone's nightmares to perfection. Also of note is Jeffrey Donovan for his portrayal of J. J. Jones, corruption personified. Jones is a man able to whisk people away to asylums with no need of warrants. Scary indeed.Changeling shares a theme with several of Clint Eastwood's other films. Unforgiven and Flags of Our Fathers come most readily to mind. His lesson concerns truth and lies, and exposing the hypocrisy of falsehoods for want of the truth. The truth is rarely pretty, but generally preferable to lies, and will often come to surface, if given enough time. I doubt I will watch this struggle for truth for a long time to come (it's not one for casual viewing), but it's a very good film.A- 1"
The Escapist             ,TruthTella,,crime,2013,1,"Don't waste your time on this movie. Complete dud. Very slow moving with no twists or action. For a prison movie this ranks at the bottom. Poorly planned escape. One of those movies that jumps around to different points in time. Characters are poorly introduced and you know nothing about them. No back stories, little information, unrealistic. Just a low budget poorly acted movie that tries to hard to be ""artistic"" or ""deep"" but fails. Decent story but done poorly and made boring.Maybe it plays better overseas and in the UK but any decent film student in HS could beat this movie. I've seen good UK movies before, but can only think of cultural differences on why anyone would like this movie. No action, no suspense, no drama, predictable plo"
Nim's Island             ,jtuchler,1,adventure,2008,5,"OK - who compelled Jodie to do this movie in the first place - it used none of her talents, and it made me think less of her (in that strange way we judge actors by the work they choose to do).However, my boys (ages 5 to 9) liked the film, especially the 6 year old who wanted to go visit the island. They liked the adventure and the animals. To me, it suffered in a few ways: * Jodie Foster's ridiculous overacting the same theme over and over and over. It wore thin quickly. * The animal gimmicks, while cute, were kinda lame (almost as good, but not as good, as a Geico commercial!) * Extraordinary amounts of suspended disbelief required to view this film. Easily forgettable, but a nice way to spend 90 minutes with the kids. "
Fireflies in the Garden             ,melvam1,0,drama,2008,8,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of ""Fireflies in the Garden"" and it was great. While there were several stand out performances--Julia Roberts, Cayden Boyd, Hayden Panettiere...I have to say Ryan Reynolds is the one that really got me. First of all this is not one of his usual roles. Secondly, while his incredible comedic timing added lightness at appropriate moments and depth to his character's struggles, it was the open access to his heart that really moved me. Third of all...I don't really have a point but, now I'm a FAN! Um, I ended up crying quite a bit watching this movie. It's great! I hope it's released soon. "
21             ,TheRationalist,0,crime,2008,5,"This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying ""No way"" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are. 1"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,darkloveforever_101,0,misc,2008,6,"""Step Up 2 the streets"" is a movie that is for a fun, ""no-thinking"" outing. The sequel to the popular ""Step Up"" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch.There was a few good comedic scenes, and the street dancing really was incredible, especially at the end of the movie. This kind of movie is obviously going to be a little bit predictable and cheesy, but still- it's fun to see with some friends on a Saturday night.Also, the soundtrack really helped improve the movie; there were many excellent, cool songs playing throughout the film, such as ""The Way I are"" by Timbaland and ""Low"" by Flo-rida ft. T-Pain.If you give it a chance, you may enjoy it. It depends on whether or not you enjoy feel-good, funny dance movies. If not, then don't go see it! The final verdict: Step Up 2 is a moderately fun film."
A Christmas Tale             ,Seamus2829,1,comedy,2009,10,"'Un Conte 'de Noel',or as it's being distributed in the U.S.A. as 'A Christmas Tale' is a very well written,directed & acted out drama, with some minor touches of comedy,but is NOT a all out comedy as it is being touted in the somewhat misleading trailer for the film. It is a tale of a highly dysfunctional French upper middle class family with enough head cases to keep any psychologist/analyst rolling in Euros for a life time. The cast is headed by a radiant Catherine Denuve (as usual)as the head of the household,who has just found out she has a potentially fatal form of bone cancer,and only a bone marrow transplant from a family member may be the only saving grace for her. The only problem: most of her children royally hate one another. The possibilities for a family reunion at Christmas only makes for a possible meltdown. The screenplay may remind one of elements of James Joyce,as well as Antonin Chekov (especially the use of metaphors,such as the occasional use of traditional Irish music on the soundtrack,as well as one of the characters who is ironically named Ivan. The film's rather long running time (two & a half hours)may remind one of certain stage plays by Irish playwright,Brian Freil (but there isn't a slack moment in the entire film---at least I didn't think so). This is a smart,cutting film that is worth seeking out. As this is an import,and is being carried by a small,independent distributor,there is no MPAA rating, but would fare little more than an PG-13 for a bit of raunchy language,some adult situations & a rather uncomfortable scene in a hospital,involving a bone marrow transplant. You may want to think twice about bringing young children (who would probably be bored with reading English subtitles,anyway"
Bedtime Stories             ,jts0405,0,adventure,2008,7,"Normally when Adam Sandler is in more PG-13 or R rated movies you find him hilarious, because the film has extra content that makes you more prone to laugh. My first initial thought was that I would hate this movie because of the PG rating, but I will admit that this movie made me laugh a lot more than I expected. This actually might seem a little childish or kid friendly, but sometimes you have to forget about that and enjoy the movie for what it is. Also the cast co-stars Russell Brand from Forgetting Sarah Marshall's fame, who also delivers several laughs just like his previous performance. All in all it isn't as bad as you would first think. In fact it is really worth a try."

But, they really do do some impressive films ""Wolf Creek"", ""Storm Warning"" to name a few. Now, ""The Square"" is another worthy film.""The Square"" ultimately has a moral in it. Don't have a bloody affair! It's simple and yet after affair related films such as ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Dear Wife"" we still get idiots doing the dirty on their poor faithful partners! (Always men as well, just an observation). Now down to The Square's realistic, raw directing it may just drill this idea into people with adultery on their minds.The screenplay, although wildly in-your-face is actually presented as quite believable. the acting is also quite passable and the sub plot with the dogs is so romantic (I say sub-plot, more of a side dish). The Square can be quite shocking at times and the ending left me feeling quite flourished.I don't think The Square should disappoint you, some might find the pacing a bit lazy but the sharp screenplay should keep you on edge.

It was entertaining, took a unique take on the superhero thing, and didn't have an overt number of huge gaping plot holes or completely blithe dialog.If you're feeling like a Wil Smith movie, go for it.

Hancock             ,nickohzu2100,0,action,2008,5,"I had a high expectation for the movie after seeing the trailers. With the premise of a drunken superhero who found much difficulty trying to fit in a society that hated him, which was mainly due to the damages he had caused during his ""grateful"" assistance.Sadly, the movie failed to live up to the expectation. It did started off well, with it's portrayal of a troubled alcoholic superhero which was pretty interesting and funny at times. The cast, Will Smit and Jason Bateman, did an excellent job for their performance as i pretty much enjoyed it. However, as the film continues, the substance somehow gets a little too repetitive.**** Spoiler Alert****** However, the film main weakness was the sudden twist during the second act. It was totally unbelievable and felt rather rushed. It was from this points onwards, that the film starts to deviate from its original idea. There was not much explanation for the twist and it felt that the audience should just believe what the film had stated. Worst still was the ending, where it was kind of stupid. The action sequence were not the standard we expect from a superhero movie. It was not stylish enough like Spiderman or Iron Man and were rather short and very quickly paced. The camera shots were rather weird too, it was too quick, shaky and overall pretty hard to view.I won't say that this film was not totally awful, as it did have some pretty good moment such as the jail scene and the change in the character of Hancock from a bad-attitude, alcoholic superhero whom everybody hates to much better attitude superhero, whom everyone likes. Jason Bateman did an excellent job as a PR executive trying to improve Hancock image.But the movie was not very good as well. Its a US$150 million dollars production and what we get was simply a mediocre movie experience. It did had an excellent formula but it was poorly executed and failed to deliver the substance it promised."

Believe me, the FBI Internet police would have a lot more capability than this killer.Diane Lane is one of my favorites. I wish she would choose her roles better.Lastly, I was very disappointed with the ending of the movie. This movie did not have near the appeal of Silence of the Lambs."
W.             ,VinceRocca,0,misc,2008,1,"The Whitehouse preached WMD's and the advertising for this movie preached an entertaining comedy about an underdog who lands the most important position in the world. Neither delivered.Instead I got a movie about a guy who pines for his father's affection and becomes President, all the while never really getting said affection. There is no ARC in this flick, nothing is learned and many events of Bushy administration are skipped. All those great phrases on the teaser poster are ditched. How a guy does a 180 with his life and becomes President in 10 short years isn't here. Nothing is really here, not even an extreme left view that W. screwed us. Nothing. The movie is pointless.So why make this flick? Oscars! That's it! Lets get some shiny statues for outstanding performances in another useless SLOW boring movie. It's sad, Tom Cruise should get an award for his performance in Tropic Thunder, but instead an actor from this flick will get that award, because this is a serious Stone vehicle.Why a 1?

Liv Tyler is as angelic as usual and Tim Roth and William Hurt round out a great cast. The action sequences were done really well and I loved all of the little nods to the Hulk lore like the Lou Ferrigno cameo, the purple pants scene, the Stan Lee cameo, and the name of their old time friend ""Stanley"" being a nod to the creator. The plot also developed really well. The only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with abomination was a little anticlimactic.

Joel Edgerton's story is a simple premise which has a familiarity to it that could have easily failed as it has in lesser movies but he adds enough plot twists & side plots to keep it interesting until the non-predictable ending. This film does not have the recognition it deserves. I remember seeing him interviewed prior to the film's release saying he was excited to be working with his brother Nash.

Changeling             ,Tony43,1,misc,2008,9,"It's ironic that because of the 1950s TV drama ""Dragnet,"" Los Angeles got the reputation of being a city with a squeaky clean, incorruptible police department. It's ironic because nothing could be further from the truth for much of the city's history.The 1920s and most of the thirties were particularly lawless decades for LA cops. LA was overflowing with gambling houses and bordellos all operating virtually openly. Cops were involved in one scandal after another, including a police chief caught during Prohibition in the back seat of a police car with a bottle of booze and a half naked hooker; vice squad cops caught up in a badger game targeting a city councilman; and the commander of the police intelligence division convicted of attempted murder in the bombing of the car of a special investigator for the grand jury looking into police corruption.One of the hardest incidents to comprehend was the 1928 disappearance of 9-year-old Walter Collins, and his return five months later thanks to the ""detective work"" of the LAPD. That was a case that might have been completely forgotten by now but for one thing -- the boy's incredulous mother who took one look at the returning kid and said ""That's not my son!"" What could have prompted the LAPD to substitute another kid for the missing boy? Awash in a constant stream of bad publicity, targeted by reformers and plagued by the fact that it was a department of thieves, thugs, and incompetents, the 1928 department under Chief James ""Two Guns"" Davis was apparently desperate for any good publicity and returning a missing kid to his hard working, single mom seemed full proof. But for one thing: Mom was tougher than Davis and conducted a non stop crusade to uncover the truth and find her real son.Sadly, unfolding at the same time was the repugnant tale of a serial killer operating out of a chicken ranch in nearby Riverside county and how he was abducting and murdering young boys.All these elements --the Collins case, the police corruption story and the tale of the serial killer -- are expertly woven together by director Clint Eastwood into a movie that grows more interesting as it goes.Expertly cast and beautifully mounted (the art direction is a shoe in for an Oscar nomination)the film nonetheless lives or dies on the performance of Angelina Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins. Many of Jolie's roles don't do much to test her acting chops, this one does and she more than meets the challenge, turning in a beautifully controlled performance that should get her another Oscar nod too.If I have a criticism, it is that the movie in the end gives the impression the corruption may have ended when Chief Davis was demoted following the Collins case. He was demoted, to head of the traffic division, but was made Chief again when Frank Shaw became mayor.Corruption at city hall and in the police department simply exploded and there were so many abuses by the central vice squad, the Intelligence Division and the ""Red Squad"" of strike breakers and gun thugs that they eventually led to the 1938 recall of Mayor Shaw and a general house cleaning of the police department, which forced out Davis and more than 40 other high ranking officers.But see the movie. This one is certainly worth seeing."
The Bank Job             ,Chris Knipp,0,crime,2008,7,"In this serviceable but not extraordinary film based on real events and set in 1971 London, a group of amateurs pull off a bank robbery that goes wrong in a lot of interesting ways. Prompted by an ex-model former girlfriend named Martine (Saffron Burrows), Terry (Jason Statham) recruits a group of friends to tunnel into the safety deposit vault of a Lloyd's Bank on Baker Street. The alarms at this particular branch are temporarily off for adjustment of a new system, just as Martine told Terry they would be. The metal drawers hold millions in jewelry and cash. Things seem pretty dicey more than once during the ambitious robbery, but the crew does succeed in taking away the loot.It's not the robbery that matters, though, but the complications arising from the fact that in the drawers besides money and diamonds there are a lot of dirty secrets (the phrase ""Pandora's box"" is even used). The madam of a fancy brothel has stashed photos of high level gents and ladies doing all sorts of naughty things at her establishment. Another box contains records of a Soho porn czar's payoffs to a corrupt police officer. And still another has scandalous snapshots belonging to the sleazy slumlord and fake black radical, Michael X (Peter De Jersey), kept to blackmail the government. These include photos of an adulterous royal, Princess Margaret, and it's the need to conceal her scallywaggery that's prompted a boss at MI5 named Everett (Richard Lintern), who's been dating Martine, to set off the whole caper, calling on her because she's said she knows some ""villains."" She must comply, because he's gotten her off a drug-running charge.The Bank Job has a retro feel; unfortunately a mid-level director like Donaldson can't really compete with the best of the old heist flicks this one resembles in its more mechanical aspects. For instance, a foreign expert is brought in, and he gives a demonstration in a basement, much like Cesar le Milanais in Jules Dassin's Rififi--but the memory is devastating, because this movie is nowhere near as fresh and suspenseful and atmospheric as that Fifties gem. Of course this isn't meant to be taken quite that seriously--though it isn't meant to be farce either; it's too involved in its reinvention of real events for that. There's a successful effort to make the accents and lingo authentic, and the grungy images achieved by cinematographer Michael Coulter and intrusive music (by various hands) sort of evoke the Seventies. Unfortunately in all the complicated stuff that happens, this movie forgets what it wants its tone to be. Sometimes it's light and funny, sometimes it's just factual and hurried, and when the cohorts get tortured by the nasties, it's pretty grim.The subplots of the parliamentarians and the MI5, crooked cops and porn dealer Vogel (David Suchet), Terry's straight family life with two girls and wife Wendy (Keeley Hawes), at times seem overly complicated, but the movie would collapse without them, and film editor John Gilbert deserves credit for keeping things energetic and flowing by shifting scenes in ways that make this machine seem to be running on all four cylinders. The writing of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, an experienced pair with some admirable credits, can't be faulted from page to page; but they're trying to weave in too much material. There's another subplot of a ham radio operator who by chance intercepts the robbers' walkie-talkie communications between Terry and his rooftop lookout Eddie (Michael Jibson). All things considered it's surprising all this stuff flows as well as it does. Lively English acting helps here to make the various groups of characters, especially Terry's team, not hard to keep track of. Jason Statham stands out, with his big face, short hair, and perpetual three-day's growth of beard. That may not be a very Seventies look (and indeed the Seventies are sometimes forgotten in the film), but he has an intensity that makes his character feel stronger and more authentic than even the most able of the other cast members; it's his film, and that's another thing that helps save The Bank Job from becoming totally mediocre. It has a strong center.The ham radio interception gave the robbery its press name, ""the walkie-talkie bank job."" The police still couldn't pinpoint which bank the voices were coming from, but they broadcast tapes of them on commercial radio the next day seeking identifications. The job was done on Sunday, and Monday morning of course Lloyd's employees find out which bank was robbed soon enough. Several of the robbers come to grief when captured by the crooked cop and his porn associate, but four days after the robbery the government issues a a D notice, forbidding any further press coverage in the interests of national security, and the other fledgling thieves slip away, with mutual wink-winks and a turnover of all the incriminating materials to authorities. A majority of the box holders did not report their losses, end titles say, so by implication they were all up to skulduggery; even the money was largely dirty. Oh, those naughty Seventies."
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,gradyharp,0,adventure,2011,8,"THE YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF is a very quiet, small film that depends on dialogue rather than action. It began as a short story by Pete Hamill and was adapted for the screen by Erin Dignam. As directed with quiet intensity by Indian director Udayan Prasad the film is more an exploration of isolated individuals who for different reasons do not fit into society and how four of those individuals discover themselves through their interaction with each other. Brett Hanson (William Hurt) is discharged form prison where he has served six years for manslaughter: he has a history of run-ins with the law and seems to face his release with a certain degree of fear of the outside world. He meets two youngsters - the lonely Martine (Kristen Stewart) who has only a father and an absent one at that, and Gordy (Eddie Redmayne), a Native American asocial misfit itinerant - and because of a sever rain storm the three set out in Gordy's car to find shelter. They stay in motels and gradually each characters past unfolds: the running development is Brett's history of coming close to a significant relationship with a fearful woman named May (Maria Bello) whose fear of relationships was temporarily resolved with her romance with Brett - all of this history is played through flashback scenes when Brett was working oil rigs in New Orleans. Martine and Gordy are fascinated and a bit fearful of Brett as an ex-con but they both connect with Brett's essentially good spirit and insist that he stay with them and allow the bonding youngsters t help him recover the one love he had. Two generations of lost people collide then bond and learn from each other. There is considerable emotional energy in this somewhat laconic film with as much being discovered by silences as with dialogue. William Hurt offers a profoundly understated performance: Stewart and Redmayne provide the perfect naïve foil for his reconnection with the world outside prison walls - both the physical prison he has just left and the mental prison in which he has been hiding all his life. Maria Bello is convincing as the strong woman who fears vulnerability while desperately in need of being loved. This is a film that may not have made it in theaters but is probably best viewed in the intimacy of the home via DVD. Grady Harp"
Garden Party             ,jay_hovah703,1,drama,2009,NA,"I have a habit of liking movies with low production value due to their craptasticness. There is nothing about this movie that is good except for the fact that it tries so hard with its worn out stereotypes and shoestring budget. The movie doesn't portray reality or LA at all. Yet, in all its cheesiness, I found myself smiling. The scenes with Ross Patterson as Joey Zane are really funny. He's trying so hard and it shows.The movie itself goes nowhere and ends where it starts: without any crescendo or plot succession. I guess these people are older and perhaps wiser, but I doubt it.I give this movie a 7 for its bad dialogue, tired portrayals of artists, and quotes like, ""I don't go to school. I'm a musician."" If you like cheese and have a couple minutes to waste, this may be the movie for you."
Julia             ,bandw,1,crime,2009,7,"Tilda Swinton has to be one of the most interesting actresses of her generation. When we first meet her here as Julia she is a cynical, down-and-out alcoholic whose life consists of getting drunk in a bar in the evenings and then sleeping with whomever she can attract for the night. But Julia realizes that her life is going nowhere and her desire for money leads her to misadventures, to understate the matter. We think that this is going to be a tale of redemption, and it does touch on how the relationship that develops between kidnapper and kidnapped changes Julia, but by the end, after murders, lies, kidnappings, double-crossings, and more drinking, it is hard to admire Julia too much when she displays a bit of compassion for the boy she in fact kidnapped.Swinton did not mail this one in--she goes at the role giving 100%. I just wish she had chosen to apply her considerable talent to material with a stronger message than, ""Oh! what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive!"" But, with such a blistering performance she creates a memorable character and I could only stand back in appreciation.The supporting cast is good, including the child actor Aiden Gould. The pacing kept my interest to the point where I didn't think about the major plot holes until after the movie was ove"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,mukava991,1,misc,2010,10,"The Baader Meinhof Complex succeeds in bringing the social upheavals of the late 60s-early 70's to life for 21st century viewers in a realistic and urgent way. The Baader Meinhof gang of West Germany was more or less equivalent to the Weather Underground in the USA  primarily students and intellectuals and their hangers-on who became frustrated by the failure of the mass protest movements of the late 60's to overthrow the world order. This frustration led them to engage in acts of terrorism, meant to provoke the state into increasing repression which in turn was supposed to provoke the population at large to mass revolt. (A similar movement existed in 19th century Russia when terrorist bombers, impatient with social quiescence, took to assassinating prominent officials, including Tsar Alexander II.) It didn't work and it only killed or injured a lot of innocent people, alienated millions more and ultimately reinforced the status quo.This film not only re-stages the street battles, bank robberies and bombings in a manner up to the best Hollywood-action standards, but also reveals the individual, psychological complexities of the central gang members as portrayed by some very fine actors. The gang was a combination of downright sociopaths (personified by Baader) and morally outraged mainstream citizens (personified by Meinhof). It was a vast and messy enterprise, and director Uli Edel wisely allows the sheer chaos of it to explode across the screen in all of its confusion in order to replicate as much as possible the instability and the passion that characterized these events at the time, and to keep the story alive and flowing. In short, he crams as many aspects of the story as he can into two and a half hours, giving the audience an abundance of notions to explore during and after viewing"
One Missed Call             ,jaddison383,0,horror,2008,1,"Of all the atrocities I've seen on the big screen, this flick just might be the worst. Combining poor story-telling, bad characters, and laughable special effects, One Missed Call is pure crap. As much as I hate to slam something with the lovely Shannyn Sossamon in it, I can't stop myself with this. Poor choice, Ms. Sossamon.The only thing the film does decently is building up suspense, and there are some intense moments. But then the pay-off is so cheesy I found myself laughing. And the story doesn't even make sense, especially with an ending that kills any possibility of reality.Horror has really seen a downfall in recent years, but this film is the worst. It seems that intelligent thrillers/horror films have completely left the market. With torture porn films like the Saw franchise taking over the marketplace, wonderful movies like 2006's The Descent are rare triumphs. I want more of those. 2/10 stars.Jay Addison "
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,CameronDMeister,0,action,2018,3,"After the Last Crusader Indie should have been able to hang up his trademark hat and whip and ride into the sunset as an unforgettable movie icon.Sadly the greedy folks in Hollywood wouldn't allow that, there was money to be made and a legacy to taint.Crystal Skull got a lot of flack and rightly so, it just doesn't feel like an Indie movie and reeks of cashgrab and desperation.With the awful Shia LaBeouf in tow Ford sells out unforgivably in a movie that couldn't hold a candle to the original cult trilogy.Awful on every level and simply should never have been made."
College Road Trip             ,rachel_molitor,1,adventure,2008,8,I agree that this movie was predictable and simple...but you guys obviously did not take your kids with you. My daughter loves Raven from her Cheetah Girls movies. She is a spectacular role model for girls and her movies are about having fun and doing responsible things as a young woman unlike most of the movies out there with girls as their stars. Most of them focus on chasing boys. She is the positive role model parents pray for.My girlfriends and I love Martin Lawrence. The faces he pulls never get old. He's got charisma and as soon as he's on screen everyone is smiling. He's the kind of guy that lightens the mood and I know many many people who love seeing him on screen. How can you not like a guy that brings giggles with a gesture or funny face?If you have daughters take them to see this movie. It's a great kids movie.
Righteous Kill             ,ferguson-6,0,crime,2008,6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, it is cool to see Deniro and Pacino on screen together again and it's inexcusable that it didn't happen a few more times over the years. But cool casting alone does not make a movie. Director Jon Avnet (""88 Minutes"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes"") and writer Russell Gewirtz (""Inside Man"") have discovered that.On a bright note, Avnet somehow managed to avoid the whiny, screaming Pacino that we have been subjected to so many times these past few years. Instead we get a guy drifting through the film as if drugged like a hyper-active child. DeNiro on the other hand does all he can do to be the tough, aging cop. We are treated to the facials, hand gestures and top notch line deliveries that we have come to expect.The two legends are joined by rival partners John Leguizano and Donnie Wahlberg, who are convinced that Deniro's Turk is a serial killer. Their captain in this is the rarely seen Brian Dennehy. DeNiro's character somehow is hooked up with the department ME played scorchingly by Carla Gugino, who in real life would undoubtedly be cheating on her multi-millionaire husband and not working for a living. Almost as a story line toss-in, rapper 50 Cent plays a drug dealing club owner who tries to play ball with the cops. Also want to mention that Alan Rosenberg has a small role and offers a reminder of his skills, which have been rarely seen since he became President of SAG.The film has many twists and turns and diversions, but there really is no doubt who the serial killer is. The video of DeNiro apparently confessing to the crime was actually a good idea and some of his best work. As with ""88 Minutes"", I am just not pleased with Avnet's directorial style. The attempts to shoot cool shots and toss in some quick focus just give it the look of someone trying too hard to be Scorcese. Still, it is worth seeing for DeNiro but you probably won't be surprised.While certainly watchable, this one is just not quite as smart as it tries to be."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,jotix100,,adventure,2009,NA,"Michael Chabon's 1988 novel "" The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" was a novel about coming of age for a young man. The book is a fine account of a summer in the life of Art Bechstein, the son of a mobster who falls for Jane, a young woman, who is in love with another man. There is no doubt in our minds Rawson Marshall Thurber had the best intentions when he decided to adapt, then direct, this beloved work of many for the screen.The problem seems to be in the way Art comes out in the movie, where he also serves as the narrator as well. The way Mr. Thurber conceived his main character does not resonate with the viewer. It is never quite clear what did Jane and Cleveland see in this bland person to befriend and be part of a group; they are unevenly matched, to say the least.Cleveland is the most complex character in the novel. He is a bisexual man that is in the equation for the thrills he can get out of his situation with Jane. Art finds out soon enough what Cleveland is all about, but in the end he too is seduced by a guy that is a manipulator of the worse kind. It is also hard to believe, the way Cleveland is presented in the film he is the criminal he is supposed to be. Art, on the other hand, appears to be a closet homosexual, in spite of the sexual relationship he was having with Phlox, something that seems contrived and phony.Any film in which Peter Sarsgaard appears is worth a look. He is the most lively character in the picture. Mena Suvari shows up as a brunette with such a different look. It is hard to recognize her at first. Ms. Suvari is at her best in the film. Jon Foster is too bland to get anyone's attention. Nick Nolte plays Art's father. Sienna Miller, in spite of her looks, is an enigma in the movie.One thing that plays well is Theodore Shapiro's fine musical score. It gives the picture some class. Michael Barrett captures the spirit of the city, and its surrounding area in great image"
The Women             ,cliffcarson-1,1,comedy,2008,9,"Like a lot of people familiar with some of the reviews, I had prepared myself for a flat remake full of catty women priding themselves on being put down artists. I didn't plan to see this movie. It was almost by default that I did. In fact, if it hadn't been playing around the corner at a second run movie theater (and at discount prices) I wouldn't have seen it. After all, I'm not a particular fan of anyone in the cast. Like a lot of people I thought, what are all these rich actresses doing remaking this dated story? I'm not a big fan of the original 1939 Cukor version either. Yeah, the comedy plays well on screen but in reality, no friendship could survive the way those women treated each another. The June Allison musical remake of the 50's is as gaudy and depressing as any movie ever made, so going in I already had a bias against this type of thing. LET IT BE KNOWN, no matter what you've heard about THE WOMEN 2008, it is DEFINITELY the best version of this story ever film. I think the people disappointed in this new version are the ones hoping to see these characters as they were portrayed in the original. Women backstabbing, cat fighting and sabotaging each other while exchanging quick catty put down lines. Director Diane English has not remade THE WOMEN of 1939, she has re-imagined the material into a film that actually MEANS something. A transformation of the old material that is full of new characters that, for the most part, are every bit as memorable as the ones in the 1939 version. The only similarity they have with the original are the names. This movie surprised me.If any story needed to be ""re-imagined"" for a present day audience, it's this one. I've never been a fan of Meg Ryan and I'm not a charitable audience in any movie, but Ryan completely won me over by the end of this film. These actresses know they're contending with a 1939 classic, but under the direction of English, they follow their own instincts and in doing so have redefined the characters and made them memorable and touching on their own. It's refreshing to see women on the screen presented this way. Grappling with decisions that will affect their lives, their families, their careers, their friendships and most importantly, their consciousness. Also refreshing is how English doesn't pander down to her audience. She gives us material that we have to rise up to. The characters are given decisions that we as an audience wonder what we would do in that situation. As a director, her pacing and edits are quick and assured. She knows the material and knows how she wants to present it. What elevates this film above the 1939 and 1956 versions are the ideas presented in it. The nasty cattiness between the women has been replaced with more thought provoking ideas. Only the manicurist, played by Debi Mazar stays true to the 1939 character. The rest of the cast are basically new characters with the same names. Eva Mendes is a knock out and not as hateful as the Joan Crawford characterization. Without question, the real surprise of this film is Annette Bening. English gives everyone a chance to shine in this film, but it is Annette Bening's character that gives the film it's center. If you're looking for a Rosaline Russell interpretation you're going to be disappointed. This is a new character and Bening makes her every bit as interesting and memorable as Russell made hers, only in a different way. I liked the way her character comes clean with Meg Ryan at the table about selling her out. I also liked the scene between Bening and her best friends daughter on the park bench. Equally as wonderful are the scenes of Bening pushing her ideas for the magazine on her reluctant associates and eventually selling her ideas out in order to save her job. I also thought it was smart on the part of English not to have a physical cat fight between these ladies. English winks at her audience by having Bening toss a banana at Meg Ryan and hitting her on the head, but only as a way of getting her attention. I also disagree the the criticisms of the way Bening looks in this film. She is nothing short of beautiful. Also wonderful is the casting of Candice Bergen as Meg Ryan's mother. The chemistry they display here seems an interesting extension of the mother and daughter roles they played in 1981's RICH AND FAMOUS. Jada Pinkett Smith is very likable and Carrie Fisher is memorable in her one scene. I could have done without the final baby sequence at the end of the picture and I had problems with the casting of Bette Midler. In all fairness, the audience in the screening I saw this movie in loved that baby delivery sequence, but I'm a guy and it kind of grossed me out. Bette Midler has become one of those actresses that thinks she can do no wrong in a movie, but whether it's the part as written or her acting, I was uncomfortable watching her. Her delivery of the ""lamour, l'amour"" line lands with a thud if you're familiar with the '39 original. OK, so this film did not fair well at the box office, but look for it to strike a cord and become popular on television. The message of this movie being that one does not need to be in a relationship to feel complete. You can be complete on your own, whether you're a man or a woman."
The Brothers Bloom             ,robbierobinson,1,action,2009,2,"I am giving two stars because I finished this movie frustrated and could not wait for it to end. Like a con, I suppose, a movie should not be too clever for its own good. ""Bloom"" leaves clever in the dust and heads for self-important and pretentious. At times I sensed the makers rubbing their hands together with glee congratulating each other on being so damn smart. On the plus side, Rachel W. was very good and her romance with Adrien B. did hit a soft spot with me. Perhaps the international scenery was meant to add glamor or intrigue,but it just made it seem more contrived and precious. Should have shot it in Cleveland,it might have actually made the movie less slick but more attractive."
The Lucky Ones             ,nathaniells,,adventure,2010,9,"This is one of the funniest movies about serious topics, and I thought the acting was excellent. Almost every scene in the film has the three main actors in it, and the dynamic between them is fun to watch. The three soldiers coming home on leave find themselves stuck together, and a road trip adventure ensues. The circumstances they get into tell us a lot about the characters, and each scene gives more depth to the individuals and the relationships that develop. I really liked all three main characters even with their flaws.I laughed more during this movie than I usually do during comedies so I guess that means it has my kind of humor. Unlike the review by ""Super and Mik"", I didn't think it was slow or the ending at all predictable. I thought the plot was engaging. I rated the movie 9 out of 10 stars, but I'm not sure what could have made it a ten. It's well written with a balance between comedy and drama. It's perfectly cast, and I also liked the directing and attention to detail. I highly recommend this flick. I don't understand why it flopped at the box office."
Street Kings             ,Quinoa1984,,misc,2008,7,"I didn't go into Street Kings expecting a masterpiece, and I didn't get one. What I did expect is what I got, more or less: a competently made corrupt cops drama that throws on some heap-loads of stereotypes (not just racially or ethnically but just movie stereotypes, which may possibly be true to form them), and even crazy hysterics. If there is any significant achievement it's in taking the cop movie into such depraved depths it's like looking at a very entertaining infected boil: you know it'll pop any minute, and the pus might just run out a little bit here and there till there's more to squeeze out. There's almost an underlying current of hopelessness that gives the movie some intellectual lift, but at the same time it's such a time-waster that unless you're hardcore fans of the actors it's just about worth a rental.Keanu Reeves goes from wooden to soggy-bottom wood as a cop who has been doing some dirty tricks to catch the bad guys lately (like setting up two Koreans- who are bad dudes for sure- by having them jack his car and then catching up with them to pop caps in their behinds), and he might be ratted out by his former partner. But when his partner is killed in very conspicuous circumstances, he goes to investigate it further while on a quasi-probation for even being at the scene of the crime (the crime, by the way, has one of the cheesiest ""don't die on me"" moments I've ever seen, laughably bad in how it's executed, no pun intended). Now, the conclusion shouldn't be at ANY surprise to anyone in the audience who's at least seen ONE other work by James Ellroy, the film's co-writer.What does give it just a bit of extra lift is the extreme quality of the conclusion, how things seem so ridiculous that in any other hands this would be total nonsense. David Ayer, the director (and writer of Training Day, the perennial new millennium corrupt-cop saga), does have a good handle on the material though, even with ham-bone performance; Forest Whitaker is one of them, sadly, as he basically retreads his persona from The Last King of Scotland as the ""King"" of the corrupt cops. There is some not too shabby work, like a nearly phoned-in-from-House performance from Hugh Laurie (not unappreciated if you are a House fan), but it's mostly from supporting players like Jay Mohr in odd mustache and Common, the rapper, as one of the 'thugs'. It all kind of blends together as a pulpy orange of a B movie, good for something to not ponder too long over, but not as horrible as you might expect for a genre piece. It's a flavor of the season."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,Simon_Says_Movies,0,animation,2008,6,"For those looking for a sunny escape as the weather grows more bitter this fall season, I have some backhandedly cheerful news. The good new is: That Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (cringes at title) is actually significantly better then the hackneyed and infinitely disappointing original. The catch: It is still not quite good enough. Let me first say however that I am not expecting this review to be read and adhered to by young children, but rather is directed towards the public as a whole. Thusly, I would imagine, in fact I am almost certain, that young children will adore this film. But even myself being a huge fan of animated films, I will give tentative praise to Madagascar 2, when addressing those of an older demographic.The original Madagascar was a hodge podge of childish slapstick, inside jokes strung together with a meandering narrative, speckled with characters voiced by nondescript bland voice actors. While not all these follies have been rectified here, some have and others have been partially reconstructed and the result is a more touching and mature animated feature. The animation has also been ramped up, and despite having the same recognizable visual stamp, is far more vivid and textured. All the key players are back; Alex the dancing lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the bootylicious hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), Marty wise crackin' zebra (Chris Rock) and Melman the paranoid giraffe (David Schwimmer). As the troupe leaves Madagascar on the penguin refurbished plane, they are joined by King Julian (Sasha Baron Cohen), his aid Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and an obnoxious tagalong named Mort (Andy Richter). Arriving (dangerously) on mainland Africa, the New York natives find a land of wonder of endless savannah and collections of animals<U+0085>like them. Among the natives is the lion king Zuba (voiced by the late Bernie Mac) who happens to be Alex's father. After a tearful reunion, danger looms as the watering hole suddenly dries up, and friendships are strained.One of the most prominent recurring issues lies with the voice-work. Ben Stiller is bland, but when he does attempt to zest it up, it becomes readily apparent it is him. Gloria's character is unmemorable, as is that of her silent admirer Melman. David Schwimmer is funny because of both delivery and expression, but his skill is halved when doing voice-work, and leaves an awkward character. One thing I will raise compliment to, is the creator's choice to dial back Melman's germ-a-phobic tendencies and focus more on the character, but he is, alas, still someone of a downer in an Eeyore type way. Added to the cast is the scheming lion Makunga, voiced surprisingly banally by Stephen Baldwin who vies for Alex's father position at the head of the pride. Boasting the much needed spunk, is Rock as Marty, Mac as Zuba, Will I Am as a womanizing hippo named Motto-Motto and Cohen as King Julian who gets more screen time, and wastes ner' a second. And how could I not mention the penguins, which have not yet become gimmicky or annoying and add a lot of mature class to the story.Overall however, Madagascar 2 bears an eerie resemblance to The Lion King, both in setting and characters, with the lost son, manipulative lion and wacky sidekicks. While not a deliberate rip-off, the comparison is unavoidable and only bears reminder of how superior that film is. There is also a disastrous subplot involving a stranded tour group led by an ill conceived and unboundedly obnoxious character called only ""Nana"". All in all, kids will be entertained, and adults never bored, but it is not great. Not even compared to other DreamWorks offering such as Kung Fu Panda. If your child needs to rush out and see this in theaters, then be sure to oblige, but no harm would be done in waiting for the DVD.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
Frost/Nixon             ,Rodrigo_Amaro,0,misc,2011,10,"Nixon might had lied countless times but this film doesn't, except for some artistic license or other that is necessary to make the story more spicy or to fill a drama and tension that might have never existed during the famous Frost/Nixon interview. Ron Howard directs ""Frost/Nixon"" a thrilling story with the behind the scenes of one of the most famous broadcasts ever presented in television, and that is the meeting between Former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and English TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen) after the President's impeachment. This meeting will be just like a long awaited boxing match between two heavyweights and it will take all of their power, intelligence and courage to make of this event something memorable and it will be memorable. Behind these two fearless men there's a great team assisting, played by Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Matthew McFayden, Rebecca Hall, Oliver Platt and Toby Jones.Transforming a play of success into a film is a very difficult job but writer Peter Morgan adapted it perfectly, with wonderful dialogs exchange between Sheen and Langella and all the actors, balancing drama, comedy, heated discussions, and of course, using quotes of the real interview, one of the most successful events ever presented on TV, very historical. Allied with a magnificent screenplay there's a highest quality of the performances. Langella might sound and look like a Nixon caricature but he manages to portray the President in his emotional and darker sides, a figure that needs to be doing something useful other than just be a retired politician, always in the arena even if that arena is a TV show where he might get trapped with his demons, face to face with the American public. Sheen makes of his Frost a entertaining man who gives a leap into a whole new field (a serious interview with a former president) where he needs to find a way to survive or win what could be the battle for his career, his reputation, but more than that he wants to be a star in America making the interview of the Century. Two men without their masks in front of a whole audience trying to win a battle where the winners are us the viewers delighted with such incredible moments. The supporting cast is top-notch and is amazing to see all of them together in such a brilliant project.Explosive in its content, thrilling in its presentations without losing the rhythm and the movement, ""Frost/Nixon"" comes as one of the most absorbing films ever made. It was everything I expected and more! Brilliant! 10/"
The Reader             ,westpenn49,1,drama,2009,NA,"If you have not seen the movie or if you have not heard to plot synopsis please take my word for it, this movie is powerful, it may shake you to the core. It is about hard choices and how we deal with them. Now please stop reading.p l e a s eHanna's secret, that she is illiterate is so crucial to who she is. We tend to understand why she acts as she does, but one of the central and pivotal decisions in the movie is Michael's decision to do nothing about his knowledge of that secret. Pay back for the hurt that she has caused? I do not think so. It is more a decision to honor her startling choice of responsibility for 300 deaths over revelation of her secret. there is no doubt that Hanna also bore guilt for the deaths. She is seemingly the only honest person in the courtroom, telling the truth when all have lied. It is only about herself that she lies. Michael could have confronted her, could have revealed the information to the court in several other ways, certainly through his professor he could access the right people, but he keeps Hanna's secret for her and suffers for it even more than he had before.This is a story of honest and proud people trying to remain true to who they believe themselves to be. She does not intellectualize her decisions, ""I was a guard."" ""You can't let prisoners run loose!"" It never occurred to her to ask why these people were prisoners but one look at her life and we see that she too was a prisoner. This does not absolve her of her guilt, but it does explain her actions. Unlike the other guards she understands too late that there was another way and for that she accepts responsibility.But even more than the admission in court, her decision to send Michael to New York produces the most compelling scene in the movie as the agent of the guard confronts the victim and survivor. It is heady stuff and though the victim is sometimes criticized for being cold and bitchy, how else could she be when a stranger brings such news and an apparent plea for forgiveness. And what seems like a cold inquiry, ""What was your real relationship with that woman?"" turns to be the source of redemption for Michael, he finally admits to another his secrets, in the scope of things they are not big, but they have weighed on him for over 30 years by that time.One last thing, the strange sad, beautiful gift of a tin. It was the wrapping that was more valuable than the gift.I did not always understand the motivation of the actors, but in the end their unexplained motives play out as in real life leaving us the viewers to pick up the pieces and move on."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,rexit-1,0,misc,2008,7,"""Il divo"" (i.e. ""the divine"") is a view of Italian politics in the 70ies, 80ies and 90ies, centered on its main character: the 5 times prime minister Giulio Andreotti. He is a tiny man, quite fragile looking (hunpback, dog-eared), but very witty, and with a huge aura of power around him (one of his famous aphorism is: power tires those who don't have it). He was a controversial character: first depicted quite as a saint, then as the great maneuverer, and at last as a politician able to welcome the evil to reach his aims. At first sight, this movie surprised me. First of all i was surprised by the ironical and grotesque cut that Sorrentino gave to his movie. Then i was surprised by the judgement suspension that this movie gives to the main character: yes, of course, there are tons of evidences that Andreotti had to do with evil persons to keep his power, but the movie director never says ""he is the evil"". At the second sight i found out there is more. At the second sight the main character faded into the whole background. This is a movie about Italian politics as a whole. This movies points out how italy has become the country that is nowadays. It shows the slow downhill starting from the first idealists of the republic (such as DeGasperi), down to politics such as Andreotti (for whom ""a tree needs manure to grow up"", a sort of Machiavelli's ""a greater aim justifies any deed""), down until the politics that just want power for power's sake (for this reason the portrait of Cirino Pomicino - this name looks like a joke, but it isn't! - is wonderful). So no surprise when you read about an Italian politician that is judged for corruption or something even worse: it's the consequence of the downhill of the politics that common citizens cannot stop anymore, simply because citizens have no power anymore, it is all in politicians' hands and they share it from hand to hand. I can understand that foreign viewers can find this movie boring and difficult to understand. But forget for a moment it is a movie about Giulio Andreotti, and watch it as the history of 30 years of a real country's politics. Veeery frightening the scene in which Andreotti, caught by insomnia, walks in an empty street surrounded by a 20 men's heavy armed escort. In a ""normal"" country, straight people should be able to walk safely in any street with no need of any escort at all. That's all imho..."
Changeling             ,aharmas,1,misc,2008,10,"There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as ""Mystic River"", ""Letters"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and now ""Changeling"". True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.Eastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn, Freeman, Swank, Hackman, and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood's movies, and that leads to the center of this film: Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks, let's state something clearly, the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force, proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras, but that when she is working for a director, she gives her best, regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona, keep it to yourself, concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.As the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child, Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won't quit, and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child, and it's quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film, as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.The film contains amazing production values, as we are taken back to an era that doesn't exist anymore. The recreation of the time Los Angeles was on its way to being a real city is incredible, as we see it before it fell apart and spread all over a gigantic geographical area, losing its identity. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film, and there are some moments bound to become classic, as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe.All in all, ""Changeling"" may be very difficult to sit through, but it is not less impressive, effective or good than any of the last five films Eastwood has made. As a matter of fact, it's just one masterpiece from the man who could teach Hollywood a few lessons. 2"
The Bank Job             ,diane-34,0,crime,2008,10,"Diane and I watched this marvelous movie several days ago on the recommendation of a friend and we were far from disappointed; the movie was a cracker and we both indulged ourselves in a crime movie with out the accompanying Hollywood histrionics of car chases, crashes, fistfights and assorted bloody mayhem to entertain the folks in the Heartlands.Because the story was true and the details of the case even 37 years after the fact are still officially masked, the whole viewing experience is extremely powerful. The movie is of course plot-driven and what a plot it is. It must be hugely difficult for the actors in such a movie because they know, regardless of how well they conduct their acting tasks, the audience will be absorbed in the script and the""what happens next syndrome."" However, all the actors in hindsight, did not interject one (at least for me) discernible misstep in their collective performances.The sum total is a movie of sublime excellence that only the British seem to be able to carry off so well. It is in this respect an old fashioned movie, meant only in superlative terms. It is a movie to be savoured in all respects."
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,Guam_Critic,1,adventure,2008,8,"My preteen child says ""Its good"". We have been waiting a month to see this film, following the advertisements up to the opening weekend. I could enjoy the film because I can suspend a sense of reality as the plot unfolds.A wise film goer should never expect reality from talking animals. Especially from Disney studios.The movie is shot from the view of a wealthy Beverly Hills resident going into Mexico for the first time as a tourist. She does not speak Spanish, and is unfamiliar with places where people live on a dollar a day. So the film is filled with the false perceptions that a totally clueless and wealthy tourist would gain. We get to laugh plenty at her childish nature.Politically-sensitive viewers should avoid this film, especially pro-Latino sympathizers. The lack of Political Correctness falls on both sides of this border. Although some aspects of Hispanic life are portrayed negatively, it is somewhat equalized since the heroes were Mexican (both humans and dogs) and the Anglo Americans were portrayed as clueless rich folk.Go see it if you have small kids, enjoy animal adventure flicks, and are not upset by unrealistic portrayals of ethnic groups."
Good Dick             ,michellemanning7098,1,misc,2011,2,"I do not think this movie was as fantastic as other reviewers seem to claim it. It did not have a significant story line and I felt no love or connection to the characters. I felt the plot was random and empty and the movie was not necessarily put together well. My favorite characters in the movie were the other guys that worked in the video store- and they had a small contribution to the plot progression (which didn't exactly ""progress""). After reading the synopsis I was pretty let down by the movie. The synopsis had a better story line than the movie did. I was actually dreadfully bored when watching ""Good Dick"" but I continued to watch it in hopes that something extravagant would happen. But that never happened, so instead I finished a movie that I was, to put it bluntly, disappointed in Sundance for"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,kjp_asian,0,adventure,2012,10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. One of the best ""chick flick"" movies and even my whole family watched it. I highly recommend watching this. Some poignant scenes ....made me cry towards the end. I believe I'm starting to like Kirsten as an actress, I am not a fan of Twilight.William Hurt portrays his character well. By spending time in a confined space on his own accord was a great idea on his part or the director;s, Humbling himself to understand the character and placing himself deep within the role intensified his part in this movie.I loved this movie. I loved how this movie explains loneliness can affect lives and what some can do to go to distance to achieve happiness and harmony. But I might be wrong...that is just my opinion and maybe my opinion doesn't really matter. What matters is that I enjoyed this movie and I think others will enjoy it also. It's worth a chan"
"Surfer, Dude             ",Gordon-11,0,comedy,2009,NA,"This film is about a world famous surfer who tries to live according to his ideals, and resists a very generous offer to endorse a surfing video game.The plot of ""Surfer, Dude"" is paper thin, so thin that is almost non existent. The film is just 75 minutes long excluding the credits, and there is not even material to cover half of the screen time. Usually when the plot is non existent, there is something else to make up for it. In ""Surfer, Dude"" there is no fun, no humour, no moral teaching, no witty lines and not even nice scenery to look at. The only thing that they could come up with to keep viewers interested is plenty of nudity by numerous topless women. And seriously, does Matthew McConaughey really need to be topless all the time? ""Surfer, Dude"" is hence reduced to a narcissistic vehicle for him to expose himself. ""Surfer, Dude"" is a boring disappointment."
Iron Man             ,g-bodyl,0,action,2008,10,"Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10"
Trucker             ,sfiver,1,drama,2011,NA,"The two times I've seen this movie I've missed the first ten or so minutes. Often those initial scenes can lay the entire foundation of what follows.Simply stated, I liked the film. The ""belated"" mother and ""angry"" pre-teen concept is rarely explored. It is normally the child/father reunification, which I suppose is more common. It is very rare for a mother to abandon her infant leaving the child's total care to the father.The film's overall synergy is the intimate portrait through the screenplay and extremely honest dialog between mother and son. Its downfall rests in the same place.Michelle Monagan's ""Diane"" is not fully believable as the runaway mother turned rig-driver. I place this malfunction on the director. Her seemingly instant acceptance as Peter's mother is hollow. However, when that bump (although it is apparent throughout the film) is overcome it becomes a bittersweet love story. Young Jimmy Bennett's ""Peter"" is relatively excellent. When the two characters are left alone, which is a great deal of the picture, the film works best.Dying father ""Len Bonner"" (very curious name) played by Benjamin Bratt offers nothing to the overall story and script. His screen time could not be more than 8 minutes. His importance to 11-year old Peter appears distant and unrealistic. It would've been justifiable to simply have buried him at the beginning of the picture.Overall ""Trucker"" is a worthwhile watch, if for nothing else than for Jimmy Bennett. I'm guessing from the IMDb stats that he was about 12 or 13 when this film was made. Further research shows he currently plays the nerdy, teen-age genius on TV's ""No Ordinary Family."" His career is one to watc"
The Dark Knight             ,himaank,0,action,2008,10,"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
Gran Torino             ,park_christian,0,drama,2009,5,"I've seen a number of Clint Eastwoods films, and although he is an excellent actor/director, this particular film lacked anything that could be considered as cinematic specialty. The story is mediocre and the choice in actors were ""okay"" at best. The acting and the script didn't seem to come together well, and there was a lack of passion. Basically, it seemed like the actors were acting, like they WERE reading a script and not completely immersed in their roles.I'm not saying it was a bad movie, i just mean to say it wasn't a GREAT movie. I was very surprised to find this title in one of the top 250 IMDb movies."
Summer Hours             ,real-to-reel,1,drama,2010,2,"Outside of the few film segments featuring the exuberance and playfulness of children and adolescents, the remainder of this film consists largely of half-baked characters and unsurprising dialog -- involving an upper-crust 'art society'-type family and their coveted material things (of inheritance). I was unable to get behind the (too predictable, ho-hum) characters, unoriginal story line, and tiring moving camera: I dropped out after about 45 minutes of careful viewing and then selectively fast-forwarded through the rest. This is one of those films which seems to have surfaced from a combination of ample production assets plus a lack of creative vision. Furthermore, many cinephiles like me are tired of encountering 'too familiar' actors in films; instead, we much prefer to be exposed to fresh, even unprofessional, talent. Major film directors Rossellini, Pasolini, and Bunuel, for example, were fully aware of the filmic (and economic) value of using unknown/lesser-known actors -- and they did so often to great effect. Binoche and Berling are fine actors, but as with Tom Hanks and Gwyneth Paltrow, hey, we're just plain tired of the lack of intrigue such overly recognizable (and therefore somewhat predictable) actors bring to the screen. On a related note, Alan Ball, the academy award-winning screenwriter of American Beauty, once said, ""I can't write characters that have no flaws; they don't seem real."" Summer Hours does eventually expose character flaws (or call it human nature), but the flaws are embodied by characters of a kind that discerning viewers may find difficult to believe, care about, or relate to. Not enough existential intrigue or human diversity here: too much stale white bread to chew on."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,pschwebe,0,animation,2008,6,"99 words or less:If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one. The first movie centered around how the characters cope, as a group, with landing somewhere strange and unexpected. This movie is not quite as focused. They've broken it up into several sub-plots involving the main characters.That being said, well, it's funny. It's got the zany kind of humor of the Bugs Bunny/Warner Bros. pantheon. Tongue-in-cheek, self-referential, nothing new, but hey, it's entertaining, the animation's wonderful and it-all-comes-out-right-in-the-end. Fun fluff.I feel better now."

Nights in Rodanthe             ,PWNYCNY,1,drama,2008,7,"This movie is like a baseball player trying to hit a home run and gets really close to hitting one out of the park but never quite makes it. The producer of this movie is trying to convey some kind of important message to the audience and does a good job trying but succeeds only in sending bits and pieces. This movie also raises other questions: Is Hollywood still able to produce a love story that succeeds in keeping the audience's interest? Is Hollywood still able to produce a love story that is not corny? Is Hollywood still able to produce a love story that is well-acted and well-written? Amazingly, shockingly, unbelievably, after watching this movie, the answer to these questions is a qualified yes. Parts of this movie are tedious and can bring a viewer to the brink of slumber, but the movie sufficiently recovers to keep the audience at least awake if not thrilled. The story avoids corniness and the usual Hollywood contrivances that render such Hollywood movies unintentionally laughable and has an upbeat ending in what is, for Hollywood, an attempt to tell a dramatic story involving deeply emotional themes. Diane Lane's performance is outstanding. She is definitely the star of this movie. If you decide to take the time and spend the money to watch this movie, please remember that it's made in Hollywood, so don't expect profound philosophical insights, but do expect a movie that you may actually like."
The House Bunny             ,puffball97,1,comedy,2008,6,"I went with my mother and my nine-year-old niece to see ""The House Bunny"" in the early morning in a relatively empty theater where there were only women. Of course it won't be the most memorable movie I've seen, but for late August, it's not all that bad.Comedienne Anna Faris is perfectly cast as a carefree, big-haired and hare-brained Playboy bunny who after celebrating her 27th birthday (that's 59 in bunny years) at the Playboy Mansion, where she has lived much of her life, gets kicked out of there by yours truly, Hugh Hefner. With nowhere to turn, she looks at a sorority house that seems to resemble her previous house, only not as big. There, she accepts the job of a house mother to seven social misfits who make up the sorority Zeta Alpha Zeta. They need 23 more pledges before they are totally ousted as a campus sorority by the beautiful but snooty Pi Alphu Mu sorority.Do the clichés sound familiar? Yes, they do. It seems like the creators of this movie grew up on ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" one of my all-time favorite movies and the granddaddy of all jocks vs. nerds and losers who become winner comedies. So they decided to make a ""Nerds"" comedy a generation later with a feminist perspective. Faris's character, appropriately named Shelly Darlingson, first takes on all the wallflowers and makes them like her with flashy clothes, heavy makeup, costume jewelry, and platform shoes. At first, it is successful and boys fall for them. Soon enough, they see Shelly as frivolous and teach her to have brains as well as beauty. This leads Shelly to a forced, clumsy conversation with the man of her dreams (Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks). At the end of the movie, everyone wins except for the Pi Alpha Mu sorority.There is a fine cast. Anna Faris perks everything up in what could have been a total lamebrainer. Her appearance and high voice get laughs, but when she does a dead-on ""Exorcist"" voice by saying everyone's names in order to remember them, that is the real deal. Colin Hanks and fellow Hollywood Offspring Rumer Willis, daughter of Demi Moore (and looks a lot like her) and Bruce Willis, provide able support. Katharine McPhee, the American Idol Runner Up of 2006, is made first ugly, then beautiful, as one of the sorority members. Listen for an ""Idol"" reference in which Faris tells Hanks she listens to Paula and Randy and that Simon is mean. The rest of the cast is amiable as well. We tend to know more about Shelly and the misfit sorority than the snobby girls or the hunky boys. Small parts by Beverly D'Angelo as a snide veteran house mother and Christoper McDonald as the prissy dean are provided nicely as well.Now I would not put this on a must see list, but it is okay for a lazy day. As they dump out leftover movies for the summer, I would rather see this than a truly terrible one I was made to see with a friend - ""Stepbrothers,"" where Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly did nothing but scream their heads off and I was so exhausted the night before that I fell asleep and could barely stay awake. For ""The House Bunny,"" I was awake the whole time through."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,tedg,,animation,2008,NA,"Vegetables who act as if they are human (and eat vegetables of a different order).Some of them act as pirates in a show, and become ""real"" pirates in just the same way, with just the same distance of abstraction.Its complicated by the further addition of a mechanical race that emulates the vegetables (that are emulating humans). And a further magical ball that masters everything. On the other end are a herd of living cheese curls and another of boulders.This is another of those films which have all their narrative value in the way these abstractions are drawn. The story doesn't matter in the slightest; no character matters. No ""message"" exists. It only has value in the way it engages the child-viewer, and the way it engages is by presenting layers of imagination, obvious methods of abstraction.Kids used to play by imagining and acting stories. Its a value associated with inner dialog, and abstract reasoning. It is an essential life skill. Kids don't do that anymore because advertising has convinced them that play is toy-centric and stories come assembled from a store.That opens up a need for movies that play with the abstractions of inner dialog, and visually explicable layers.I wish they were more open, more ambiguous and child-generated. And we know enough about cognitive science to know that the age group that this targets shouldn't be watching TeeVee AT ALL.But this IS pretty complex stuff. For instance, they have no arms or legs, and this is dealt with differently. The arm hand operations are simply performed as if arms and hands did exist. The walking is handled quite differently, as if they really had no legs; they hop.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life"
Space Chimps             ,HaagenSugaDan,,animation,2008,8,"I might as well say this straight away, this movie moved me. As a simple kind of man I've always believed in keeping things short and simple, and simply put, I have not seen such a movie in years. My three youngest adored it, but this isn't just a movie for kids. In fact it is a rare jewel, a movie that truly appeals to all ages. To say I loved it would be an understatement, in fact I'm not entirely sure what I felt when I left the cinema. Great CGI, great voice acting, great story, = great movie. Instead of following the sheep flocking to the massively over-hyped Batman movie, I saw this, and boy, was I rewarded. Go and see it, you won't be disappointed."
Quarantine             ,kevin_crighton,1,horror,2008,6,"Angela Vidal and her cameraman are making a documentary about the fire brigade. Joining up with a couple of them, called out to an apartment building, they soon discover something horrific is going on....Quarantine is a an American remake of Rec. This means it has two major problems to overcome. First, Rec was to me the scariest movie I've seen in a cinema for almost 18 years (the last, was The Exorcist III)! The second, is that it IS an American horror movie remake. Now, the track record for this has been awful. Consider the evidence - The Ring, The Grudge, One Missed Call, The Wicker Man to name some. Hell, they can't even remake American movies! The Hitcher, When A Stranger Calls (I still shudder about that one!), Prom Night, Halloween. So this movie starts with two major points against it.However, despite a couple of minor issues, and one major one, it's not that bad.The reason it works, is that the director John Erick Dowdle has taken the scares from the original and simply re-done them. In fact the movie is almost a shot for shot remake of Rec! The fact that despite having seen Rec, the scares still work is a testament to not only how scary the original was, but also how well they've been re-done.As I said, there are a couple of minor faults. Some of the make-up effects, don't quite work. The other minor fault is that the cast, while good aren't as convincing as the original cast were. Case in point, Jennifer Carpenter as Angela. At the start she's fine, but by the end she's a bit over the top in hysterical and terrified mode compared to Manuela Velasco.But the major fault, and this one is harder to overlook is that they've changed what is actually going on. In this movie, it's suggested that it's a strand of rabies that has caused the outbreak. In the original, it's never really revealed what is causing it, although events towards the end suggest a possible supernatural cause. But because they've changed it here, it means the final scenes don't work as well, and don't really fit. And the final shot, which was revealed in the trailer by the way, again doesn't work in the remake.The movie is slightly longer than the original, spending more time with the fireman at the station before the events begin, and has a little more emphasis on what is going on outside also, but these little changes don't affect the movie that much.How you view this movie will depend on the original, Rec. If you've not seen the original then it is a pretty effective scary movie, especially the last 15 minutes. However if you've seen Rec, then this movie offers nothing new, and isn't as good overall."
Ghost Town             ,dalt99,0,misc,2008,6,"Ricky Gervais is a funny guy and he is allowed to show off his humor and dry wit in a wonderfully hilarious way throughout most of this movie. It starts off with him in his office. As Bertram Pincus, he is a dentist and a woman is in his chair gabbing non-stop about her family life. Gervais' character could care less about her life. Throughout the first 45 minutes or so of the movie we learn that Bertram is not only a loner but a self-centered jerk. Not a rude, screaming name-calling jerk but a guy who speaks his mind and just isn't afraid of hurting peoples feelings. This makes him seem more real and so the humor is much more realistic and not over the top like so many movies seem to be these days. For example, in one early scene a fellow dentist in his office is inviting him to cake to celebrate the birth of his child. Most people would say, ""great, be right there"" and that would be it. In other movies, the jerk would say something like ""Why do I care about your damn baby?"" Instead, Bertram looks at him for a few seconds with a slightly annoyed look on his face and asks ""Anything else?"" It's dry biting wit like that which kept me laughing out loud through the first half of the movie. Another scene with him in the hospital has a nurse asking him general questions that everybody has had to answer when checking into a hospital such as what is your date of birth and what's your address. In other movies he might make up some silly answers to these questions but true to his character he just refuses to answer these ""irrelevant"" questions and the back and forth that goes on with him and nurse had me in stitches. For me though, once the movie gets into the second half with Bertram helping out Kinnear's character, who is a ghost after dying early in the movie, the movie starts to feel like every other romantic comedy with cliché misunderstandings and the ""I saw that coming from a mile away"" ending that mostly blows it for me. The biting and dry humor is there throughout the movie but it becomes less frequent as the ending draws near. So, as much as I enjoyed the first half, as usual, once the romantic part of the comedy comes into focus, the comedy becomes more cliché and less realistic. Even my friend who is a HUGE romcom fanatic was rolling her eyes and looking bored through most of the second half. The first half is funny and fresh with laughs coming at a rapid pace, while the second half slows down to a crawl at times and drags on with plot devices borrowed from hundreds of other romantic comedies. Too bad. Just like Gervais' character, this movie started out to be different and real but in the second half it decided to conform to every other movie of it's type."

I had never seen a movie like this before, nothing happens on the movie, all you can see is the neck and head of the actors besides some parts of this movie doesn't make any sense, the godfather is the best movie about Italian mafia this one is awful. I don't know how people can watch this kind the movies I'm not against foreigner films but now I know how a good history can be turned in a terrible mistake.

21             ,mike872,0,crime,2008,4,"21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movieseems bent on helping casino ecurity Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is not an MIT prof but a professional gambler.The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and the four orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another.In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense. He'd have been caught on the second visit without a disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip the Ben to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller. Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma and the four fellow MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them even graduated from MIT.Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was marekt designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity."
Igor             ,rjray,0,animation,2008,8,"As a fan of CG animation and cheesy horror, I was really looking forward to this one. It wasn't as good as I had hoped, and not nearly as good as it *could* have been, given the talent. But the premise was nicely original, and the actors put in some good performances. Steve Buscemi steals almost every scene he's in, and Eddie Izzard was really good. Jennifer Coolidge was another standout, as was Sean Hayes. I think Cusack made a very funny character, certainly more fun to watch than the Disney lead in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The animation style is very reminiscent of The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride. Overall, I really enjoyed it. It was a nice break from the steady diet of comic book films and action films I've had this summer."
The Lucky Ones             ,shockdoctor,,adventure,2008,3,"After watching the trailer for this movie, my wife and I were interested in seeing it and jumped at the chance to go to a free, advance screening.During the movie, it kind of felt like the story was going somewhere and even though it was fairly slow, I was interested. Then the movie ended, and it felt like nothing had happened at all. Despite the decent acting and the initial promise of the story line, the ending to the movie just made it feel like we had wasted two hours of our life.My wife also hated the way Rachael McAdams character was written. She said that she thought her character was written to be the stereo-typical sad, unintelligent woman.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you need somewhere to go to take a nap for about 2 hours."
The Incredible Hulk             ,kylehodgdon,0,action,2010,9,"For everything that was wrong with 2003's ""Hulk"", 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" does right. It's kind of too bad that this movie came out right after the blockbuster ""Iron Man"" because it kind of became a bit overlooked. I did like ""Iron Man"" just a tad more than this, but only by a small amount. This was every bit as much an awesome superhero movie that ""Iron Man"" was. Most people are somewhat familiar with Hulk, so they did not start this story with the birth of the Hulk character. Instead they could really start the story off quickly. I think that was a good idea. We saw that in ""Hulk"" and it was not necessary to show it again. I thought Edward Norton played a great Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler also played a very good Betty Ross. Unlike the 2003 Hulk, this one really looked much, much better. Not only did his look improve, but his actions had more power than the 2003 version. The Hulk character is a tough one to make a story around since his power only works when he is angry, so I was impressed that this story really made sense and was very good.The Abomination character was also done very well. To me, it might take a certain kind of enemy for the Hulk character to have and they nailed it with him.The final scene of the film definitely made me very anxious to see more Marvel films, especially the one that will cap them all off: The Avenger"
Death Race             ,Theo Robertson,0,action,2011,4,"Being a big fan of Roger Ebert one thing I have quickly noticed about his reviews is that the worst insult he can give to a movie is "" that it resembles a video game "" . Click on the external reviews on the left and look up Ebert's review and you'll find in one short paragraph of his that it's impossible to add anything because he has all the angles covered Still I may as well contribute something to this page . At least one thing the producers of this remake have got right is if you don't like the opening sequence then at least they're putting their cards on the table letting the audience know where the movie is going . If you get invited round to a friend's house for them to show you their new racing game on their play station and you're not very entertained merely watching a game then you probably be too thrilled by watching this remake of DEATH RACE 2000 One can't help thinking that after casting Statham and McShane perhaps the producers should have just made their own film instead of doing a remake of a film that far from being a masterpiece was at least very entertaining . The first third of the movie is by far the best part . Blue collar worker Jensen Ames receives his pay packet at the end of the month and goes home to his wife and before he knows it he's in a rough tough prison where inmates are beaten up for infractions such as swearing or because the guards feel like it . Looking on the bright side inmates are still allowed to smoke so it's not all bad . Good news too if you're a lesbian in a female prison because the inmates make Angelina Jolie look like Freddy Kruger Since the film then needs to justify it being a remake featuring car chases and a large body count logic gets thrown out of the window . It's only the roughest toughest meanest mother crushers who get to take part in these gladiatorial racing games . Anyone doing time for minor crimes such tax evasion is not considered so it's okay for Ames to go on a race killing members of the Aryan brotherhood and other assorted violent criminals because Ames is really a good guy . It's never revealed why the state would think it's a good idea why all these psychos get armoured cars complete with 30mm cannon to race about in but one never questions the internal logic of a video game"
Wanted             ,nicbarber,1,action,2008,4,"I am a massive James McAvoy fan since his Shameless(UK) days, so was a bit iffy on how he would transfer to an action movie. Despite a fair performance from him (even if his American accent is hard to believe and turns back to his native Scottish every now and then), my friend who dragged me along apologised profusely once the film had finished. Here's some of my problems with the film. 1.) The Script. If the script was good, I'd be able to get over the lack a story line. It started poor, I was hoping for an upsurge, but it never came, making Jolie,McAvoy, Freeman (and the rest, including the guy from Hustle (UK) -what was his point?) just look daft.2.) The first 20 mins, at least, is about how the main guy's life is crap. In the matrix, this lasted about 5 minutes before getting into the action. 3.) All McAvoy does in the 2nd 20 mins is scream! 4.) How much slow-motion does one director need? even the kissing scene? really!5.) The Twist really is cringeworthy - you can tell that the script read: Cross- ""Wesley, I'm your father!"" Before they realised that George Lucas had already used that line, so they had to quick-change it to ""You're my son!""One redeeming feature - you get to see Morgan Freeman say 'Kill that Mother-F****r. I always knew he was Samuel L Jackson in disguise!Action wise, it's good if a bit unbelievable, (but that's what films are for...) and the special effects are OK. Shame about the script... 2"
Lakeview Terrace             ,Quinoa1984,0,crime,2008,5,"I'm sure Neil LaBute is a talented director- I've enjoyed both Your Friends and Neighbors and the criminally underrated Nurse Betty (not seen In the Company of Men or Shape of Things, but heard great things about both, not so much the Wicker Man redux)- and Lakeview Terrace occasionally flashes some moments that reveal his understanding of the subject matter at hand. Other times, he just lets the screenwriters do it for him, and it turns out far less fascinating or really disturbing as it could have been. Early on the story speaks its promise: a conservative LA cop- yes, conservative first and foremost as one notes the character's disdain for democrats or just liberalism in general- played by Sam Jackson sees a white guy (Patrick Wilson) and black woman (Kerry Washington) move in. From the get-go there's hostility, if at first more subtle and just annoying. And there's some possible questions that could be raised in the course of the running time of the picture, if just as possibilities.But the problem, very soon to see, is that everything that motivates Jackson's character to act the way he does becomes twisted around a plot contrivance. I won't spoil it (not to really shield you from it, just because it's not worth it if you intend on seeing it), but something from Abel's history that shouldn't be so blatant and be more ambiguous or allow Jackson as an actor some room for subtlety or room for interpretation is shoved down our collective gullets. One might wish that there would be more room for three-dimensionality in general, but at best we get just 2D and at worst it's basically one continuous drumming beat until we almost kind of dread Jackson's character coming in on Wilson and Washingtons' scenes, not so much because he's supposed to be menacing but because it throws off the flow of the story. It's not even that Jackson is bad in the performance, on the contrary he does the best he can and sometimes does bring that flash or just flinch of the face that reminds us how good an actor he can be.LaBute can't figure out entirely how to proceed with a highly charged drama, however, without a heavy-handed metaphorical device. It is a fact that the Southern California has been a hot-bed of wildfires spreading all about, destroying lots of pricey property and leveling to waste millions (maybe billions) of dollars of revenue. The tactic here in Lakeview Terrace is to take that symbol of fire burning down a city and transplant it into the burning down of racial bonding and peace and yada yada, and it's not really a metaphor/symbol/whatever that hits right away - but when it does, yikes is it an over-bearing claptrap made especially for the climax (I was almost pining for that also hackneyed Haggis formula of crashes in Crash).And, again, motivation and really well-defined characters end up sinking this after the promising first act; as soon as Abel's agitation turns to practically psychotic behavior, it's hard to actually connect with this past something out of a horror movie. And I don't mean that as something for a cathartic reaction or other. Wilson and Washingtons' characters don't help much either as we're privy to a contrived sub-plot involving an ""unintentional"" pregnancy (not to mention Jackson's own semi-interesting sub-plot with him screwing up on the force). By the end it turns to being laughable as a quasi-revenge quasi-what-the-hell treatise on uneasy racial relations where just some more hints of unintentional racism, as opposed to just the sinister presence of big-bad-black-*cop*, might be an advantage. 5.5/10"
The Duchess             ,Rave-Reviewer,1,misc,2008,7,"The latest slice of period drama to grace our screens is this biopic on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who during the 1770s was patroness of the Whig party and prisoner of a marriage which made her, among other things, suffer the indignity of having her husband's mistress living under the same roof. These heritage dramas are an industry all by themselves; the armies of prop hirers, wig and costume makers, researchers, production designers, location scouts and (mostly) British actors who go to make them must find themselves in almost permanent employ. The BBC does them, the Americans have a go at them, and the public can't seem to get enough of them. The Duchess is a superior example of the genre, though nowhere in the league of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, and combines the spectacle of Keira Knightley looking glamorous in a range of frocks and wigs, while at the same time honing her acting talents (no more those rictus grins), with the guilty pleasure of following the uncomfortable parallels between the fortunes and indiscretions of the ancestress of Lady Diana Spencer with those of the Princess of Wales herself. Lowering over the whole proceedings is the truly superb presence of Ralph Fiennes's Duke of Devonshire, Fiennes an actor who can convey polite discomfiture or threatening ire with slightest twitch of the mouth. In his hands the Duke becomes far less a melodramatic villain than a product of his time, and you almost feel sorry for him. Go and see The Duchess; only those who have had children will balk at the liberties taken with childbirth and breastfeeding. But not even that will spoil the fun."
Frost/Nixon             ,MartinHafer,0,misc,2011,9,"What I am about to say may sound a little mean. However, until recently I never took Frank Langella all that seriously as an actor. With film credits like ""And God Created Woman"" (1988), ""Masters of the Universe"" and ""The 12 Chairs"", I hadn't seen very much from him that was outstanding in any way. However, here in ""Frost/Nixon"" he demonstrates that my preconceptions was definitely wrong--he is a darn fine actor. His performance as Nixon was wonderful--especially when it COULD have come off as a parody--like Rich Little doing a Nixon impersonation. But, he was able to capture the man very well--and, provide a bit of insight into a very enigmatic man.As for Michael Sheen, who co-starred and played David Frost, he was excellent as well--but he did not dominate the movie like Langella and really couldn't due to his character. Making Frost any different would have been unrealistic and the viewer is naturally drawn more to the Nixon character--even if they dislike him.As for the movie, it's a film that is probably going to appeal to you more if you know a lot about the Watergate affair. This means that younger folks who didn't live through and remember the 1970s will get less out of it unless they know their history well. As for me, I'm a retired history teacher, so even if I was only a kid when Nixon resigned, I understand what had occurred and the figures involved. So, when names of the various people involved are mentioned or what exactly Nixon's involvement was in the cover-up are discussed, it would sure help to know the basics. If you are fuzzy on this, reading through Wikipedia or another website wouldn't hurt.Looking at the film's box office receipts, I could assume that because Watergate is a rather distant memory is why the film made so little money. After all, the acting and writing certainly were not at issue--they were top-notch. And, I must also admit, the film was quite cerebral and there aren't a lot of things to appeal to teens or someone who likes explosions or raunchy comedies (you do get to see a gratuitous butt near the end, but this isn't enough to appeal to this crowd). An amazingly good fil"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,corrosion-2,0,crime,2008,NA,"Terribly Happy is a stylish Danish noir based on actual events. It's a classic ""fish out of water"" story. Robert (Jakob Cedergren ),a police officer is sent from Copenhagen to a small Danish village as its new Marshall. He soon finds that the village people have their own set of rules and laws and are not ready to accept outside interference with their coda of justice. Although at first Robert tries to play everything by the book, he is soon drawn deeply into the villagers' web of deceit and corruption.The director Henrik Ruben Genz creates a very bleak atmosphere set against the Danish countryside. The film is full of black humor, reminiscent of Coen Brothers, specially Fargo. The casting is particularly good, with Kim Bodnia outstanding as a wife beating lout. Terribly Happy is tightly directed and is gripping from start to finish. Recommended."
Adoration             ,doug-697,0,drama,2008,9,"Adoration is a drama that plays like a mystery. But it's a complex mystery as there's a lot going on and you're kept guessing and trying to keep up.The movie has something to say about racism, the effect of the death of parents on children, family responsibility and both rejecting the bad in one's parents and accepting the good.There are three primary characters in the movie. A boy who lost both his parents, the mother a Christian and a Muslim father, in a car accident. The uncle, a tow-truck driver, who has struggled to raise the boy in the home the boy grew up in. And the boy's English teacher who encourages him in a ""Drama class"" experiment which goes badly wrong. Each are in the middle of a inner struggle. The boy had been lead to believe by his cruel racist Grandfather that his father had deliberately killed his mother. The Uncle, feels guilt because he could have prevented the accident. And the boy's teacher, who gives questionable guidance with suspicious motives, but whose demons are not revealed until the end of the film.I found these three characters to be very interesting. The boy, like most his age, is tech savvy, which is the match that lights fire. The Uncle projects a basic, humble decency which out- weighs his flaws and ultimately wins out. And the woman, suitably abstruse as the woman in a mystery should be.There are a few memorable scenes. In one a woman appears in a very conservative Muslim headscarf, heavily adorned with metallic coins, looking like someone from a Star Wars movie and is invited into the Uncle's home. The cultural divide between the two seems gigantic, like they were from different planets, even though the woman spoke perfect English. This will hit home with people living in a city like Toronto. (as an aside, I may be completely wrong, but I thought what she was wearing is, in fact, a wedding scarf, which would make no sense with her original statement that she was ""just driving around"" and saw the nativity scene on the lawn, but would make sense with the real reason that it was a test of the Uncle.)While this movie might have grand themes of prejudice and death of family, what appealed to me most was the depiction of the strength of common decenc"

Marianna Palka is sensational, what comes to mind to describe a film like this is to imagine clerks blended with garden state with a little Piano on the side interwoven with a deeply serious subject matter that is tackled with intelligence, sensitivity and wisdom. In my opinion its rare for someone to be able to obviously put so much of themselves into a film they have written, directed and starred in to have enough perspective to be clear in what they are expressing without it losing sight of itself. I never felt that with this film once, which is again another reason to recommend it.I only reference those films because I hold them in such high regard. This film can be added to that list.

The Brothers Bloom             ,Avalanche_647,1,action,2009,3,"The first thing I asked myself when I walked out of the theater was: ""What's with the silly hats?"". It was of course afterwards that I realized that this question, however the most pertinent, was far from the only one I would ask myself that night.In fact, going trough all those questions, I came to realize that ""The Brothers Bloom"" did not make one iota of sense to me. And, what's worse, I wanted to make no further effort at all to try and understand the movie better - which is rather uncommon for me.throughout it's labyrinthian plot, this ""conmovie"" from beginning to end seems to be trying only one thing: to con it's way out of any form of explanation. In stead, the plot just keeps wiggling and wurming it's way to the most unsatisfying and enigmatic conclusion I saw in years."
The Incredible Hulk             ,Rxblinkboy,0,action,2008,8,"Honestly, as soon as I heard they were making another Hulk movie I was surprised. When I heard they had cast Ed Norton, I was shocked. So going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. Coming out, I feel like an idiot because it was really masterfully done. Lettier does an amazing job, Norton was fantastic, and as far as a comic book movie goes, this one is just about on top with little nods and mentions. If you don't walk out of this film screaming HELLL YEAAAA, then you are not normal. Far better than Ang Lee's attempt at the green man and as far as this year, it's definitely Marvel's year. No better way to make up for Spiderman 3 than releasing Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk just a month apart. Thank you Marvel for cleaning the mess Spiderman 3 left and clearing your name.

The Reader             ,jpm-onfocus,1,drama,2008,7,"David Hare wrote one of my favorite female characters in ""Plenty"", Meryl Streep brought her to life in the most extraordinary way. Here, Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have the intellectual aspirations of ""Plenty"" but there is also a form of mental illness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are to be pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmaker start to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in the moving ""Billy Elliot"" and the shattering ""The Hours"" I can't quite pinpoint what it is but in ""The Reader"" that element is more obvious than in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There are moments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in more than one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewarding experience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured Ralph Finnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and Lina Olin in a dual role. 1"
Yes Man             ,Jackpollins,0,comedy,2009,7,"The comedy, Yes Man stars Jim Carrey as Carl Allen, a man, who upon realizing he's losing his friends since he never wants to see them, agrees to go to a seminar as asked by an old friend named Nick (John Michael Higgins). The seminar is a yes seminar, in which a man named Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) talks about the importance of saying yes to everything. Carl makes a deal with Terrence that he will say yes to everything, or else have bad luck for not saying yes. This leads to meeting a gorgeous biker chick/aspiring musician named Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The relationship, although involving an age difference is sweet, tender, and funny. Carl soon figures out the most important lesson of them all: you will not succeed in life being the boring, always refusing guy he is. As you dig deeper in the story, Carl soon figures out how to live life (going to nightclubs, traveling the world, getting hyper on red bull, etc.) Rhys Darby also steals some scenes as Carl's wacky boss, Norm.

Fireflies in the Garden             ,sandieabreo,0,drama,2010,9,"I was pleasantly surprised with the concept of the story line, not to mention the quality of the photography and the especially the acting. Ryan Reynolds displayed his ability to exact emotions not usually seen from this fine young actor. He continues to grow with each movie he makes. Julia Roberts also stretched her limits as did William DeFoe. Even though William DeFoe usually plays dramatic roles, his ability to be the villain (abusive to his son) I thought did need to be refined a little more. I enjoyed the movie allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions with regards to the secrets that these characters each held; along with the realistic display of a fractured family and how they start to repair the past wrongs. This movie showed great promise to be a headliner and what a shame we'll not all have the opportunity to see i"
Adoration             ,druid333-2,0,drama,2009,10,"Without a doubt,Atom Egoyan is one of Canada's finest directors making thought provoking films,nowadays. 'Adoration' is just another shining example of his craft. A high school student who has just written a short play about fictional events that happened in the life of his parents,manage to produce a tempest in a teacup about terrorism. The premise of forgiveness is also explored. As with any Egoyan film,the elements are provided in the form of an abstract jigsaw puzzle that the audience is expected to pull together (which is what I admire about his films). His films are also slowly paced,testing the patience of his audiences (especially the ones who are used to things being tied up in a nice package in ninety minutes,or less). The cast is made up of mostly an ensemble of unknowns (at least here in the United States,but I'm sure anybody who knows their onions about Canadian actors will spot their favourites). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for mostly rough language & some brief sexuality,but is generally okay for older teenagers with a long attention span"
Space Chimps             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,,animation,2008,6,"When I saw the trailer for Space Chimps, I honestly thought it looked cute and fun, also they mentioned that it was made by the same folks who did Shrek, so I figured that it was going to be gold. I was first off a little surprised that it didn't do so hot at the box office, not only that, but it has a pretty low rating here on IMDb. I was thinking how this movie was probably awful, but how could it be? It's an animation film, so I still wanted to see it, I checked it out today and honestly, it's not a 4.4 rating movie, I think people are being a little too harsh on it. I agree that it's nothing special, but it's a cute movie that had it's moments. Opening the same weekend as The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia, we needed a good hearted film for the family as well, and Space Chimps does deliver on that.Ham is a chimp who is the grandson of a famous chimp astronaut who was the first chimp in space. When there is possible life found on another planet, three scientists decide to experiment and instead of risking human life, the send out the chimps including Ham to space to find the alien life form. Ham, Luna, and Titon are sent out into space, but Ham isn't taking it seriously, constantly joking around, hitting on Luna, Titon constantly taking credit for everything. When they do land on the planet, they meet some interesting creatures and have to save the planet since one alien, Zartog, wants to take over.Space Chimps isn't a bad movie, it's just nothing special, I'd recommend waiting for the rental. It's a cute movie thought for the little ones. But I did enjoy a few scenes, I loved the line Titon says to Ham ""Are you David Bowie?""... you'll have to see what I mean, but there are some cute and fun moments. The animation is so-so, the voices are decent, except some moments seemed a little stereotypical and cliché. But as a family kid movie, I would say that this is a go, just don't expect anything like Shrek.6/10"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,wmjaho,0,adventure,2008,7,"I'm always a little apprehensive about ex-con redemption films. They are generally predictable, and the emotional puppeteering is all too easy and familiar. And I must acknowledge that in The Yellow Handkerchief, there is more than a little of all that. But I don't think that's at the core of the movie. Rather, this is a story about three individuals, all lost and lonely, led by fate into a beat-up convertible, and finding themselves unexpectedly on a little road trip in post-Katrina rural Louisiana.Award-winning German producer Arthur Cohn put together this project, and Indian director Udayan Prasad made some great casting calls. William Hurt is at the center as Brett, a just-released ex-con battling his demons (which are gradually revealed throughout the movie) and tenuously reentering the outside world. It's a role that comes naturally to Hurt, more like his classics The Big Chill, The Doctor and The Accidental Tourist than his arresting departure in The History of Violence. The inescapably sexy Maria Bello shows up mostly in flashbacks, as the love of his pre-prison life. Eddy Redmayne (Gordy) and Kristen Stewart (Matine) steal the show as the youngsters who meet in a store, and find themselves moments later asking Brett to make them an unlikely threesome.Prasad does a great job of sharing with the audience the unadorned emotions at play as these three feel each other out, and gradually get comfortable together. There is natural tension, as Brett is older, obviously hardened, and something of mystery, and even more so when they find out he is an ex-con. But also anger, fear and disgust, before the softening. The strengths and weaknesses of each character are slowly exposed as their journey leads them in search of acceptance, hope and love. And talented cinematographer Chris Berges brings an eerie sadness to the Louisiana bayou country, not nearly recovered from the ravages of Katrina.The Yellow Handkerchief may move too slowly for broad public acceptance. But the story never lagged, holding the audience throughout, and rewarding them at the end. One might accuse the ending of being a little hackneyed (and one would be right) but that hardly dulls the shine of a movie that leaves you feeling positive and optimistic.Sundance Moment: Prasad, Cohn, Hurt, Bello, Redmayne and Stewart were all at the premiere. Best line was from Cohn, who said some people told him this was a ""little movie."" ""There are no little movies or big movies,"" he repeated twice. Sundance philosophy in a nutshell."
The Bank Job             ,ccthemovieman-1,0,crime,2008,8,"Jason Statham is well on his way to becoming typecast. It seems like he's in a ton of these kind of action films lately, although this movie is a bit more subdued and complicated than some of them. At least in this heist flick, there are several twists and turns and you have to stay alert to follow who is exactly on the up-and-up and who isn't, and Statham isn't punching out 10 people at once.This is another one of these modern-day films in which the crooks, the thieves, the bandits - whatever - are the ""good guys"" and the police and the government officials are the bad guys. This seems to be a big favorite of the anti-authority filmmakers world in the last 40 years whether it's in Hollywood or London. Regardless, it's a very entertaining film and Statham and company are fun to watch. That's also nothing new as the tough ""Transporter"" star has become a regular at playing these kind of nice guy/macho/thug roles.Statham plays ""Terry Leather,"" a man recruited by a former hottie/model girlfriend ""Martine Love,"" (Saffron Burrows) to rob a bank. Statham is a family man but desperate for money and, obviously, not very honest. Thousands of pounds/dollars is in it for the thieves but valuable compromising sex photos are the real goal of the people who want the bank depository drawers robbed. Those want to be grabbed before the owner uses them and ruins some high uppity-ups in British government. Several people wants photos for other reasons. This whole thing isn't simple; there are number of sub-plots along the way regarding who wants what in the bank and for what reasons. There is also a story involving a Malcolm X-wannabe kind of creep who is into extortion and murder. Actually, everyone is pretty much a creep in this film, just to varying degrees. They are all interesting, too, and several of the minor characters have a good sense of humor, too. In particular, I liked Daniel Mays as ""Dave Shilling."" Add some very tense robbery scenes, some sex early on, some double-crosses later and you have a very serious Keystone Cops type story where you're never quite sure what crazy thing is going to happen next.A fun two hours of diversion, supposedly based on a true-life account, but knowing filmmakers I suspect much of this is made up for dramatic purposes. That's okay, we just watch to be entertained, and this is entertaining"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,vrillsharpe,0,animation,2008,2,"My 14 year old son passed on this, so I went by myself. I should have heeded his warning, ""Dad, it IS a kid's movie."" It is in fact.But desirous of a Star Wars fix, I had to go.And I am sorry I did. What a waste of time! I probably would have gotten more out of playing Battlefront II on my Xbox. Replaying Knights of the Old Republic would definitely have been better.There wasn't really a story here, and what story there was pretty much an affront to any decent writing in any of the novels or comics in the last 30 years. There are many fan movies that are a whole heck of a lot better. Many fine things have been said that lay out the failings of this movie, so there's no need to repeat them. Most of the characters are as much cardboard as the vaunted breakthrough animation techniques. That's enough to tank any movie.Couldn't we have had a movie that didn't pander to five year olds? This thing should have come with a Warning. ""Warning! Watching this fetid pile of ripe manure, will cause you to develop a severe allergic reaction toward the Star Wars franchise."" 1"
Hancock             ,BlackHawk847,0,action,2008,9,"I saw the movie tonight and enjoyed it a lot so here's my take: Pro's:Good special effects (even though there not all done) Excellent hour and fifteen minutes (the movie is probably 100 minutes in length if I had to estimate the pacing in that time period was spot on) Good combination of humor and action (I'd say more humor though say in the vein of Beverely Hills Cop, which had a good mix of humor and action) Will Smith nails the character (even if the character goes through a number of sudden changes out of nowhere) Even though there weren't as many action sequences as expected they all were pretty memorable especially a fight between Hancock and another superhero (I won't spoil it)A really good twist that I didn't see coming at all (when you see it you'll understand) Cons: The villain wasn't fleshed out at all in any way (they really didn't need to have one in the first place and could have changed a few of the last scenes)The last 25 minutes shifted more into a drama and didn't totally fit the character of Hacock of the first hour of the movie Charleze Theron didn't have much to work on for the first forty-five minutes besides not liking Hancock The relationship of Jason Bateman's character, Ray and his wife Mary isn't fully fleshed out and the chemistry isn't all there (towards the end Will Smith has better chemistry with her and there scenes together are juicy and easily the best parts of the last twenty five minutes) Overall I'd give the film an 8.5/10 because it was an innovative look at a superhero other then all the Batman's and Supermen we're given a truly conflicted character who isn't fully invincible. There are many quotable scenes, funny moments, and good special effects that you haven't seen in other movies before. I expect this film to make a lot of money at the box office this summer and please many Will Smith fans along with action fans or people who are looking for a solid popcorn flick. 1"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,novagirl11,1,misc,2018,9,"I still like the first one better, but this is a very good sequel, continuing the relationships and the girls' lives. The issues caused by lack of communication are a bit annoying. The soundtrack is not as memorable as the epic one from the first movie, but that was a high bar to meet. Rewatching these does make me hope that a studio picks up the script proposed for the third movi"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,clark-157,0,animation,2008,7,"I just saw it with my three kids, and the youngest two (ages 4 and 7) loved it, the older one (18) not so much. In fact, most of the flaws discussed below were pointed out to me by the 18-year old...It's visually breathtaking, filled with attention to detail (incredibly subtle facial expressions, great use of light/shade, powerful scenery, nice music (although the lute music is somewhat anachronistic <U+0096> yes, I play the lute, in case you're wondering!)), and overall quite powerful. The only real weakness is the plot. I do not want to overstate the weaknesses in the plot -- I'd recommend it to parents of younger children (maybe 10 and under; even my 4-year old really enjoyed it, and he usually isn't able to maintain his attention span for an entire movie). But IMO the plot weaknesses include:Roscuro, the good rat, turns bad <U+0097> REAL bad! <U+0097> so quickly it makes your head spin. Why? The story implies that this conversion to the Dark Side occurs because his attempted apology to Princess Pea (Roscuro had earlier accidentally tumbled into her mum's soup, the shock of which resulted in the queen's death!) turns out very badly, combined, presumably, with the frustration he feels to be stuck in the dank and dreary rat world after having experienced the freedom of living freely amongst humans. The speed and intensity of his turnaround strains credulity. (Roscuro is played by Dustin Hoffman, who was Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy (1969); type casting? ;-) The fact that he turns good again just as quickly is also somewhat problematic. This, however, is somewhat more credible to me because of we are given to understand that, unlike other rats, Roscuro has always been essentially good. He is portrayed as a sympathetic outsider misjudged by virtue of his ratness. Miggery Sow, the aptly-named (i.e., plump) lady-in-waiting to the princess, also turns bad with astounding alacrity, and appears to have developed a pretty serious case of dementia as well, due, we surmise, to a difficult life. This is a bit more believable to me, but the big problem with this character is that, after coming very close to having had Princess Pea eaten alive by rats, there is absolutely no repercussion for this act. At the end we see her back in the country with her dad, happily tending the fields. What happened to the dementia? Where is the punishment for kidnapping the princess and attempting to murder her? Where is Miggery's apology or show of contrition?The film's narrator, performed with wonderful serenity by Sigourney Weaver, tells us that forgiveness is ""the most powerful thing you can feel"" (after earlier telling us that hatred is the most powerful thing we can feel... And here I thought it was love!), and this presumably is by way of explanation for why the princess apologizes... But for what? For being somewhat short on one occasion with her dimwitted, kleptomaniac servant (Miggery), and being scared of a crazy-looking rat?The character of Despereaux is consistent from beginning to end. He is a quixotic non- conformist who becomes enamored with chivalry after reading about it in a story, and he makes it his quest to save the princess. When others write of the positive values in this film, I suspect that it is Despereaux's character to which they mostly refer.But ultimately, I believe it is meant to be a film about redemption <U+0097> we are told that saying 'I'm sorry' will, essentially, make any wrong right, but the plot doesn't lead me to buy into it, particularly in the case of Miggery Sow who never apologizes for anything and gets away with her abduction of the princess scot-free.As some others have commented, another weakness (or at least strangeness) is the Boldo character, who is magical, and made out of vegetables. Why? He is apparently the chef's muse... but what's he doing in the film? There's no back-story about where he came from, or anything to explain why we need this character. I'd be curious to know how the film compares to the book; I'm guessing that most of the plot problems are not the fault of the book, but I guess I will have to have a look at the book to find out.Again, I think it's a good film, definitely worth taking your younger kids to.I just find it perplexing that with the humongous budget they must have had to hire so many huge Hollywood stars and and the many talented creative people who made it look and sound so good (amazing, really), they couldn't figure out how to avoid some pretty serious flaws in the plo"
The Escapist             ,Digsys_Dinner,,crime,2008,9,"It was only yesterday that I had the chance to watch a film that is little known, yet somehow managed to make it to my nearest Vue cinema in-between some of the current, perhaps contrived blockbusters that are on our screens currently. So it was only with great surprise that this film, which I had heard great things about after it debuted earlier this year at Sundance had a screening, after some persuasive actions on a friend, I was able to settle down for what I hoped would turn out to be a memorable prison film. At a first glance The Escapist would appear to be your usual affair of a prison drama, however Rupert Wyatt has done far more than that in this wonderful existential, puzzle box of a film, it drives on with true mystique and leaves you as the viewer questioning the true structure of the narrative as it thrives you along to the thrilling, lynchian climax.The opening of the film begins the puzzle with what appears at first to be a strange narrative choice, you join a number of inmates that are seemingly in the midst of a prison break. The thumping electronic score sets your heart racing with a mixture of confusion and interest. Just as you think your in the middle of the escape, the director makes what seems to be a very questionable editing choice. He appearingly jump cuts back in time, before the escape. The film itself constantly jumps between the escape and the lead up to the escape. Throughout the first half of the film I must admit I found this seemed to hurt the pace of the film, but that's only if you take this as a conventional Prison-Escape film. This isn't Escape From Alcatraz. And this narrative style that is explored through the film becomes clear more and really begins to pick up the pace in the second half, and the climax of the film really does show this choice of structure really did compliment the story. You genuinely are knocked out by the films climax, it's on the same level as Memento, and you feel equally fulfilled by the end of The Escapist.The cast is really five star, lead by the wonderfully diverse Brian Cox as the haunted, subdued life sentence serving inmate Frank Perry. Arguably his career defining performance. He brings multiple layers to the character impressively without much dialogue, it's a powerful, albeit silent performance for the most part, but you genuinely feel for his character, and without giving anything away you will understand why when you do see the film, as the main story point is what leads to the engineering of the escape. Cox is joined by a fantastic supporting cast of some of the finest English actors around today. For the most part there appearances are often short, but there screen time does more than enough to create the tense, look behind your back atmosphere you would expect in any prison film. Steven Mackintosh gives a chilling performance as the stereotypical inmate that is always the prisons big bad. He takes a distinct liking towards Perrys new cellie, with some unnerving results. His fictional older brother in the film, the ""leader"" of the cell block is played by the wonderful Damian Lewis who I became a big fan of after Band Of Brothers. He has considerably less screen time here but for me, his chilling stares, and few words were some of the most memorable for me after the credits rolled.The cinematography of the film is quite simply incredible. With a bleak grey tone to the film that keeps the existential atmosphere brooding in the background. Much of the film takes place in vast maze's of underground tunnel works. The filmmakers managed to captured a claustrophobic feel towards the ongoing story. Full of black shadows and long, seemingly endless age old tunnels that are barely lit by the flickering orange flame from their cell-made torch's. The cinematography really helps compliment the enclosure of the prison, both inside it, as well as the escape. Their really isn't anywhere to go, its dark, brooding, and downright terrifying. As you would expect a prison to be! The Escapist really is a revelation in regards of modern cinema. It just reels you into the story from the get go and takes you on a bleak ride through the dark underbelly of the prison, metaphorical in its tone, Rupert Wyatt really has crafted something wonderful here. The film defiantly leaves you with that deep satisfaction that Britain has been getting some blisteringly good films as of late, alongside films like Dead Man Shoes, it gives you the sense that there is still a lot of great to come."
A Christmas Tale             ,winkiecat,1,comedy,2008,1,"Tedium as only the French can do it. I checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in, and with 143 minutes left, I also considered walking out. I won't even try to discuss the incoherence of the ""plot"" or the inability of the characters to be personable because at about 1 hour in, I realized none of this mattered. It was not merely self-indulgent or pretentious, it was a vacuum. A soul-sucking vacuum. This film has no saving grace, no enjoyable character, nothing funny, and nothing sad. It isn't smart enough to be drama and there's no moment that's in the slightest bit farcical. The most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. I was tricked by those reviews, but you don't have to be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back."
Good Dick             ,pinkpixikiss,1,misc,2008,8,"I saw this movie last night at the Birmingham Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival during the encore showing and really just fell in love with it. The plot was in depth, the characters were amazing, and while some parts of the movie would keep you laughing, there was a deeper meaning hidden in the movie that was very moving. I think everyone watching the movie could find a certain aspect of a character, situation, argument, etc, that they could connect with. The movie put real life issues that many struggle with in perspective. It was not sugar coated or over done but was reality. I loved everything about it and would love to see it again."
College Road Trip             ,asilber-1,1,adventure,2008,7,"My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. The kids loved it so much, they saw it twice. The ""Double Dutch Bus"" scene was just terrific. Donny Osmond's character was so funny and I was glad my kids got a chance to see him since I was a big fan of him back in the '70's. The kids are big fans of Lucus Gabriel and Raven and I thought they gave great performances. Raven is such a talented person. I liked how her character in the movie was ambitious and determined to excel academically and still have friends and be pretty. We also enjoyed the scenes in the sorority with the stern Sorority supervisor. Nice to see all those college girls being supervised! And Grandma with her friends were big fun. The pig added a lot to the movie's fun and it was so cute. Although he did a fine job with the material, Martin Lawrence was a bit wasted in this movie. The kids didn't notice cause they don't know how incredibly funny he can be. The overall best thing about this movie was the music. The music had us dancing in our theater seats; we can't wait to get the sound track of this movie."
The Escapist             ,drcath,,crime,2009,10,"Frank Perry (Brian Cox) is a long term prisoner in a London jail where the guards look the other way and one would be wise to avoid the attentions of Rizzo (Damian Lewis), the boss inmate and his unhinged junkie brother Tony (Steven Mackintosh in scenery chewing form). The arrival of a new cell mate, Lacey (played by newcomer Dominic Cooper) coincides with Perry receiving the first letter from his family in fourteen years. His daughter is a heroin addict and close to death. Perry decides he must get out, to see her and make things right while there is still time. He goes to his closest friend Brodie (Liam Cunningham) and they enlist on-the-edge pugilist and thief Lenny Drake (Joseph Fiennes) to put together their plan.But the film begins with the escape, cleverly setting up many questions in the head of the viewer, which are then answered in flashback. We want to know why Frank starts the escape attempt what appears to be a stab wound, how drug dealer Viv Batista (Seu Jorge) gets involved and why Lacey is part of the team when he has arrived in the prison so recently. The answers come, but slowly so that it's only at the very end that the little hints and clues scattered through the story of the escape attempt itself make sense.This structure and the final plot twist would alone make this film worth repeat viewing, but not just for that. Writers Daniel Hardy and Rupert Wyatt (Wyatt also directed) let images rather than words do the talking, and with a cast of this calibre it pays off brilliantly. The actors are allowed to use their faces and bodies to tell us the story: Brian Cox letting his face fall into a pile of regret when he reads the letter, Damian Lewis's posture as he walks past the cells to find out what happened to his brother, the tiny shifts of expression on Dominic Cooper's face as he relives his forced dalliance in the showers with Tony, from self pity to self hatred and back again. It's top notch stuff.Comparisons with ""Shawshank Redemption"" are inevitable, but while ""Redemption"" was really a story about hope, ""The Escapist"" is actually a film about redemption, about the single unselfish act that can redeem wasted years, perhaps a wasted life. And, as Perry points out, that we're only as free as we allow ourselves to be."
The Strangers             ,circuitdump-1,,horror,2008,4,"First off, let's start with a note. It was 'inspired' not 'based' off true events. People need to learn the difference between the two. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is 'inspired' by true events, but still people believe it really happened. It never happened... it was inspired by the story of the serial killer Ed Gein who would take body parts off of women and make furniture out of them, and other forms of cruelty.The Strangers was 'inspired' by true events which means they probably took similarities from stories of The Manson killings and other killings of the same sort. So really the director had free range to do whatever the hell he wanted at the end, and I believe he failed.I heard about this movie a long time ago and was so excited that it was finally being released that I saw it at the first midnight showing. At first, I was enjoying the set, costumes, and I believe the acting was pretty well done. I believe the director achieved a very creepy feeling, but too many times did he use to obvious cop-out of making loud noises to 'startle' the viewer instead of genuinely 'scaring' them. The site bloody-disgusting.com made an excellent article describing the differences between these.In the end, I remember about two scenes and the rest is a vague blur. The scene with Glenn Howerton (of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia! fame. Woot!) was probably one of the most tense and unsettling scenes of the film. The other being the portion where the record is skipping.This movie is a strong example of anti-climactic. The ending was a cliché. I won't give it away but I will say that it did not leave me feeling disturbed nor did it leave me with a sense of accomplishment. Two things I look for in an ending to the flood of ""home-invasion"" horror flicks. I believe two recent films do a great job of accomplishing these factors. The recent VACANCY and FUNNY GAMES are leaps and bounds greater than this film. They do a much greater job of making the protagonists feel helpless and I strongly suggest both of them.Hopefully, I could help some. I know many will disagree with me, but quite honestly that's fine. Many of today's moviegoers enjoy paying $10 to jump out of their seat because someone's face appears in a window or a sound guy hits a wall really loud. It's the sad truth and Hollywood banks on crap like that. So it isn't going to end anytime soon.Thanks, Alex 2"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,on_the_can,0,animation,2008,7,"This film is gonna have two sets of detractors. One set will be of people dying to see George Lucas crash and burn because they didn't like the prequels. The other will be people who, regardless of their feelings about the previous movies will enter with an ill conceived expectation for a great story. The rest of you, like me will have a blast watching this thing.This movie is basically an extended pilot for a soon to premiere animated series and it plays as such. We are introduced to our characters, some new and some old and watch them set out on missions that take them through hair raising battle after hair raising battle. There is no conclusion, yet no cliff hanger, just a solitary mission, another day in the lives of Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi. In other words, no attempt at any great earth shattering plot, just a lot of good solid action and fun. Whether or not the TV series will develop more complicated story arcs and sub plots is only known by its creators right now, but its the simplicity that works here. I went into this movie expecting nothing but big action, cool characters and a slick look, and that's exactly what I got. The heart of the Star Wars franchise has always been its fun, and this is a cartoon...they're taking advantage of the opportunity to take the explosive larger than life elements of the films and skew them to an altered animated reality...which is what makes cartoons worth watching.I loved the design of the whole thing too. It is very graphic and unique and I can understand that it may not be everyone's cup of tea but for me it's a great look. In a time when movie theaters are saturated with CG animated fair, many of which are so concerned with out doing one another with their increasingly real skin textures and bump mapping, it's refreshing to see a film that wants to be different. If you want something to look real, you might as well get a camera. For those of you who thought this graphic simplistic look was some kinda time/money saver, give yourself a shake, they wanted it to look this way. And if you're an animator like myself...take note.Bottom line, you're not gonna walk out of this movie a different person, and its not gonna win any awards...but it's a hell of a lot of fun. 1"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,donwc1996,,adventure,2010,NA,"I am a big Peter Sarsgaard fan. Ever since The Dying Gaul I have been looking and watching for every film he's in. Kinsey was another tour de force - proving as I suspected that Sarsgaard is the next big male star on the horizon. He's not handsome in the matinée idol way but there's a quality about him that is true star - he lights up the screen when he's on and you just cannot take your eyes off him - and contrary to the beautiful people he has a depth that grabs you and makes you wonder what he's going to do next - he's totally unpredictable - in Mysteries of Pittsburg he shines brightly especially in scenes with Jon Foster who at the moment is starring with Jenna Elfman in the CBS sit-com Accidentally on Purpose which is based on a book by a local journalist here in Northern California. Jon Foster is another fast rising young actor whose future seems bright and the sparks really fly between him and Sarsgaard. Their scenes shake the earth in terms of eroticism, unlike anything I've ever seen on the screen. They're so totally into women - both of them - that when they're into each other - it's not only a shock because it's so unexpected but it really does make one rethink things as I had to do since I've never understood how men can do the nasty - but here it seems perfectly natural, so natural in fact that I really had to think I was ignorant on the subject. The film moves at break-neck speed but the ending is a solid thud - a major disappointment in fact it's so trite and predictabl"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,ingsoc747,,adventure,2009,NA,"Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few gripes. - The screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book. - Plot has been grotesquely altered. - Voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages (which may read well but are not the same when spoken, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The acting is more wooden than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - This is supposed to be set in 1983??? Feels more like 2003... To be fair I couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it's possible that it redeemed itself... (sarcasm). I truly hope that no one paid to see this, or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer but he should be ASHAMED of this adaptation.No stars."
Iron Man             ,Merklin,0,action,2008,9,"In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character."
Four Christmases             ,lwaha,1,comedy,2009,1,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies of 2008. The movie suffers from the lack of chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon. It's the core of the movie and we never believe in them as a couple. We drift through the movie from one embarrassingly unfunny scene to another including a sequence where Vaughn's brothers, who are Ultimate Fighters attack him, an attempt to put up a satellite dish where everyone and everything falls over. More pitiful scenes follow. A reenactment of the nativity scene is presumably added to pad this garbage out and just when you think things can't get worse....they do! The final 10 minutes goes for soppy sentimaentality with the couple's 'relationship' which is totally out of keeping with this surprisingly mean spirited 'comedy'. It doesn't matter since we never believed in them as a pair to begin with. This train wreck is ended when a baby, for the second time, projectile vomits over Reese Witherspoon. An unbelievably awful film."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,g-bodyl,0,animation,2011,8,"It's sad that movie producers don't make this kind of movie anymore. This is a classic, wonderful fairy tale that is good for the whole family. It does have a few flaws such as this movie is too dark for a G-rating. But the movie itself works and it's not boring like many people say it to be.This is about a mouse who is different from the rest of the mice. After being kicked out of this tribe, he befriends a rat and together they must save a kingdom from darkness.This movie has an impressive voice cast. Matthew Broderick does a good job playing the hero mouse.The animation is pretty good. It looked like the animation was drawn. I liked it though. It reminds me of old Disney movies. In fact, this has a great moral like the rest. I liked this film a lot. I rate this film 8/10"

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,action,2008,7,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the 19 year long awaited sequel, the big summer blockbuster is finally here! I was lucky enough to see the premiere tonite, my hopes were up, the audience was pumped, everyone was just excited, why wouldn't you be? This was the Indiana Jones to blow the trilogy out of the water. Unfortunately, I'm feeling a little empty, I am such a huge fan of the trilogy, movies that hold memories for me as well as excitement still to this day when I watch the Indiana Jones movies. Indiana is back, this film had a little bit of the old style that I was looking forward too, however, I feel like we were lied too. The makers of the film told us there would be no CGI unless it was needed like the old films, not only was there a lot of CGI, the older films had special effects, but they were real, this was a little too cartoonish at times. Not only that, but I felt like the 50's stereotype was being too rubbed in our faces: the jocks vs. greasers, the cold war fear, nuclear bomb testings, the Russians, and the aliens. I'm not going to lie, while the movie is flawed; this is still a fun action packed adventure film that is worth the full price ticket. I think the story was just more of a tribute rather than an actual movie on it's own.Indiana Jones is back, when the Russians have kidnapped him, Irina Spalko wants him to take her to find a crystal skull that is supposedly the skull of an alien. When they find it, the skull is to be returned to it's kingdom and supposedly they will hold all the power to the kingdom. Indiana manages to escape, meeting a young boy, Mutt, who tells him about Professor Oxley, who Indiana went to school with and how Mutt has heard about the skull and wants Indiana to find it with him. Together they set out to find it with the Russians on their tail, to meet with a familiar face, Marion(Raiders of the Lost Ark, you remember?), to find out another little secret about Mutt and Indiana.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I do have positives about the film. We have our fun adventure film, rooting for the good guys, laughs, and excitement. Harrison Ford still has Indiana in his blood, no one could ever take his place, Shia made himself a worthy co-star and their chemistry worked very well. Marion was a nice touch, bringing back something to the fans of the trilogy. The only problem I have with this being more of a tribute is that if you watch the trilogy, while they are connected movies, if you were to watch The Temple of Doom first before Raiders, you'd get the movie without having to see the first one. Since this is a very long awaited sequel, I can see why they would want to please the fans, but there is a new generation who unfortunately might have not seen Raiders or The Last Crusade to understand this sequel on certain characters and lines. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is definitely worth your time, but as a fan, I can't help but feel that the ending made me question what the sequel's true motives were: money or for the fans? Judge for yourself.7/10 1"
Lakeview Terrace             ,Simon_Says_Movies,0,crime,2008,7,"Seven. Yes, seven. No, I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller, nor am I referring to Samurai, Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.Particular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory ""shocker"" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.Samuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.Fashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.Few endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.Read all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/ "
One Missed Call             ,DirectedByBrian,0,horror,2008,2,"Like many lousy horror films, the premise to ""One Missed Call"" isn't half bad, though perhaps a bit recycled. In this one, Leann Cole (Azura Skye) receives a strange voice-mail message: Her own voice, panicked, terrified, and screaming. Two days later, she dies in a freak accident, uttering the same words and screams that she heard on her cell phone.One by one, the members of Leann's circle of friends receive phone messages of themselves moments before death <U+0096> only to end up dying exactly as indicated. Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) witnesses all this but can't explain it. And when her own phone rings, Beth hears her coming demise and has barely a day to discover who is placing the calls and why.Whether you liked ""The Ring"" or not, there was a certain novelty to it at the time. Then came ""The Grudge"", ""Dark Water"", ""The Skeleton Key"", and a dozen others. With ""One Missed Call"", Hollywood isn't just scraping the bottom of the barrel, they're turning the barrel over and seeing if any residue is clinging to the underside.Andrew Klavan wrote the screenplay, based on a Japanese novel and script. I can't speak for the quality of his source material, but Klavan does nothing to elevate the story to any level of class. If you thought the original Halloween was ridiculous for having Jamie Lee Curtis run upstairs(!) and hide in a closet(!) to escape her supernatural stalker, then Beth's foray into a hospital's air ducts will have you groaning in sheer disdain.The acting is decidedly poor. But it's not the kind of lousy acting that speaks ill of the performers. Instead, it feels like director Eric Valette actually requested the delivery we see on-screen. It may have something to do with the fact that Valette is a native Frenchman, that his last film job was six years before, and that ""One Missed Call"" is his American debut. He's reaching across cultural and linguistic borders for the first time, and it shows.But there's a bigger problem running through the entire film.Every film creates its own universe. Some are worlds just like ours, some are complete fantasies. But all of them must create rules of operation, including how the spiritual elements function. Even if the audience isn't aware of the rules, the writer and director must have them in mind.""One Missed Call"" creates rules, and then inexplicably ignores them at random. For example, as the victims each get closer to death, they begin seeing strange apparitions. These apparitions are the same every time, and are actually clues to what is going on. But when one character dies in a Catholic church, in addition to the apparitions she also sees the icons of Mary and the Apostles begin distorting into gruesome figures. It may be a cool visual effect, but it breaks the rules and has nothing to do with anything before or after.That same death illustrates another violation. All the previous deaths have been made to look like freak accidents, but the girl in the church is visibly strangled by a ghostly figure.I would suggest the rule-breaking is because the director cared more about cool shots, cheap scares, and phony tension. Our evil spirit moves quickly behind frightened characters, heard only because the sound crew puts in an overused ""whhht!"" to get us to jump. But the spirit proves that it does not need to materialize at all in order to stalk and kill, so why bother whhht-ing around the place? And if time and space are no obstacle, why travel through the cell phone at all? Why bother warning people they are about to die? And why do all of Beth's friends get two days' warning when Beth only gets one? Why drag the apparitions into it? Why list one of the stars as Ed Burns in the opening credits, and Edward Burns in the end credits? <U+0096> If they can't even get the credits congruent; what hope do we have of anything in between being any good? Instead of playing out the basic premise with care and consistency, Valette and Klavan mash various creepy ideas into the story until what's left horrifies us only because of its sheer stupidity."
The Duchess             ,co201gs,1,misc,2008,10,"This film really, really surprised me.Yes, it's from the director of Bullet Boy - but I'd only ever seen Saul Dibb's Line Of Beauty so I was expecting a pretty standard period piece with Keira Knightely - who I have never rated much as a credible acting talent.Boy does she impress here - she is fantastic. The Duchess of Devonshire is the perfect character for her to play, and it's obvious Keira immersed herself in the role, and completely understood every single motivation of her character.I recommend everyone to go and see this film! 1"
Bolt             ,cjd-16,0,animation,2008,8,"It's official. Disney is finally back! ""Bolt"" is a return to the old formula of having a story that works on both the level of entertaining the kids with jokes, and keeping the parents watching with a touching character-based story.At its base level, ""Bolt"" is quite possibly the funniest animated film that Disney has ever made. And thankfully, the best humor was not wasted on the movie's trailers. You think you've seen it, but oh, there's so much more! The audience at my theater, kids and parents alike, were laughing like crazy throughout the film, including one joke that kept them laughing for a good minute afterward. (I wouldn't dare spoil it here.) Rhino, the little hyperactive TV-obsessed hamster who has no idea how small he is, steals the show. Almost everything that he does is worth a good laugh, and all of his humor is perfectly in-character... not annoying in the least bit, unlike the Disney sidekicks of the 90's. And there are no fart jokes or potty humor, or other such overly-easy kid-friendly jokes that make adults smack themselves on the heads. It's classic character-based humor, which everyone can appreciate, throughout the film.The movie's base premise, a character who thinks he's something extraordinary when he's really not, may sound like a rehash of ""Toy Story,"" but it isn't. They only sound similar on paper. The execution, and what the film's drama and basic plot points focus on, are completely different. In ""Toy Story,"" Buzz's ignorance was self-induced, while in ""Bolt,"" Bolt's ignorance is the fault of the studio, who keeps him ignorant for the sake of making a more convincing show. ""Bolt"" is more of a story about love overcoming cruelty than a self-actualization one.As a serious film, ""Bolt"" works for the most part. The first 30 minutes or so, from the opening pet shop scene to the end of the Ohio trailer park scene, are spectacular, showcasing the lightning-fast action scenes that Bolt thinks are real, plus using the wonderfully detailed and subtle character animation, (which is remarkably lifelike,) to capture the tender Penny-playing-with-Bolt moments. You really feel for Penny and Bolt because of how believable the animation is, and those first images of them together really stick in your head throughout the film.The only place where the story fizzles out a bit is in the middle and some parts of the end. The parts where Bolt actually learns that he is not in fact a super dog, and has to cope with it, were not redundant, but they certainly weren't inspired either. It kind of rushes through them, and doesn't dwell on them, which makes such an intense change in character a lot less significant than it could have been. (This is not a spoiler, by the way... the plot shifts in a completely different direction once this part, which everyone knew was coming, is over.) I personally think this lack of perfection is because the team had only 2 years to finish the film after Sanders left, and didn't have time to iron out the story and dialog in the middle. This keeps the movie from being a masterpiece. If the whole film was as good as the first 30 minutes, it could have been. As is now, it is still a sensational family comedy achievement, but falls just short as a serious character-study film.Nonetheless, ""Bolt"" is one of Disney's best films from the last 10 years, and is not to be missed. The kids at the theater unanimously loved it, especially loving the hamster. If you have a family, don't miss it! If you like good light-hearted comedies, don't miss it! If you're a lone Disney fan holding out for the return of the near-perfect character, music, and epic animation, though, you might have to wait until next year's ""The Princess and the Frog."" ""Bolt"" is certainly a treat, but is still just short of the levels of the 90's Disney Renaissance."
The Burning Plain             ,kosmasp,1,misc,2009,8,"If you watch this movie and ""Babel"" comes to your mind, you are not that wrong. As with the movie ""Babel"", you have a very complex story line, in which many people in different places seem to be somehow connected.The end is not the biggest reveal I guess and if you stay with the movie you will see it coming, but that's not that important. What is important, is that you have great actors and a structure that keeps you on the edge. Even when/after you guessed the ""twist"". So the road is a much more rewarding experience than the goal it reaches. Keep that in mind and you will enjoy the movie"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,diac228,0,animation,2008,7,"The original Madagascar was a break from the typical mold in family animated entertainment; it was fearless, didn't slow down to teach a lesson, and was not afraid of entertaining solely on physical humor. The content was light, but it was so satisfying that it wound up being Dreamwork's second best animated movie of them all<U+0097>behind Shrek. The zany cast of characters easily exceeds the number of memorable characters in Shrek, and contained more humor and creativity than all of the other Dreamworks animated flicks before and ever since.In the second installment, you see the writers trying to give the franchise a dosage of heart and sentimentality, which is what made Shrek the instant classic it became. A bit of heart can definitely propel an animated movie into masterpiece status (see Toy Story and Finding Nemo) however this is not the franchise to do it. Madagascar is about the cast and how they interact with each other and the conflict that is presented onto them. While the laughs are definitely here, the attempt for emotion constantly makes this film slows down and keeps it from being a superior installment when placed against the original. That being said, it's still a fun, entertaining, and unpredictable movie that continues the zaniness that made the original a personal guilty pleasure of mine.In Escape 2 Africa, we follow the New York zoo animals, the psychotic penguins, the monkeys, and the lemur leaders as they unexpectedly are stranded in the middle of Africa. While at first the main four (Marty, Alex, Melman, Gloria) are rather happy at their new environment, they quickly realize that it's not all that it seems, and that their new temporary home is splitting the four apart. In the meantime, the penguins attempt to repair the plane that they accidentally destroyed. The writers did a good job in presenting all sorts of new gags and yet again refrain from referencing pop culture too much (although the Twilight Zone nod was hilarious). But, they couldn't deliver the emotional impact because of one main reason: this franchise wasn't meant to ever slow down in terms of pacing. Like a roller coaster, this movie moves sometimes extremely fast, and then can grind into a halt in the next scene. Lastly the main four don't interact much with each other, but more with the environment. There literally are at least 8 plots happening at once<U+0097>some of them are good, some of them aren't.The voice acting remains decent, but there are fewer lines by the original cast, and more from supporting characters and new characters. Bernie Mac, rest in peace, but his performance was rather bland and could have been done by anyone else. Alec Baldwin didn't have much of a chance to lend his comedic skills either. Yet again, the penguins and Sacha Baron Cohen steal every scene they are in, no matter how mediocre the previous scene was. Cohen (as Julien) has an obvious knack for comedy, and delivers every line perfectly for two movies in a row; not bad at all. Ben Stiller had fewer chances at being funny, as they had to handle all the major slower moments. Chris Rock's role was surprisingly limited, especially for someone who did so well in the original.The one major improvement from the original was the animation, which was crisp, fluid, and flowed better. Surely it's undeniably no Wall-E (Or even 2007's Ratatouille), but it's still respectably an improvement over previous work. The jokes themselves are hit-and-miss like the original; the only difference is this one has more misses. Plus it's the recurring jokes that are missing; the hula girl, feisty tourist, repetitive herd, and lion-dancing bits all didn't elicit much laughter from the audience, nor from me. We just needed much more Julien, and much more penguin-action. Maybe in the future the focus will shift; in the meantime they are just grabbing all the spotlight and attention.Bottom Line: Exactly what Scrat did to Ice Age: The Meltdown years ago, we have minor/supporting characters becoming the main hit and running the show. While the original four characters take a backseat and add emotion to a franchise that's too fast-paced for this sort of stuff, we have the penguins and Julien taking over the movie and keeping it from being another totally disappointing animated sequel like every straight-to-video Disney sequel, the ugly Shrek sequels, or Ice Age 2. The entertainment level is still magnificent the second time around, but it won't age as well as the first Madagascar did. Leave the heart to Pixar, because those folks have nailed it perfectly for years. Dreamworks can serve as the escapist cinema in terms of animation, but if they continue imitating and try to outdo Pixar, it will just dampen the quality of all their movies. Madagascar 2 is the prime example of this: purely fun and entertaining until it tries to distribute family values. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is also proof that those hilarious penguins need their own movie, pretty much immediately.Yes, right now."
Street Kings             ,DarkVulcan29,,misc,2008,8,"Keanu Reeves's acting has been called Luc warm by the critics, I don't think he is the worlds worst performer, There are so many other performers I'd like to give that crown too has the worst, but he does not fit in that category. So far his performances are not Oscar worthy, but he manages to make them memorable for the most part.Set in the mean streets of L.A. veteran cop Tom Ludlow(Keanu Reeves), who has had a strong chip on his shoulder since his wife died, uses dirty methods to get the bad guys, but his captain(Forest Whitaker) does not care, has long as he gets results. But then things begin to come down on him, When he is caught up in a shooting of a former friend turned enemy(Terry Crews), Then Tom starts being investigated on why was he there. Tom secretly begins his own investigation, he has the feeling he might have been set up, will he find out the truth, or will the truth get him killed?

Lakeview Terrace             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,crime,2008,2,"Lakeview Terrace, what could have been a great thriller turned into a complete and total mess. I'm honestly surprised that this movie has the rating that it does, I'm trying not to insult anyone, just honestly, how could you take this seriously? It was so horribly written and I was actually looking forward to this film. My major problem was that the character development, there wasn't any, you go on this roller coaster ride where you think you might understand why Samuel L. Jackson's character is the way he is, but instead they go back into making you just brutally hate this guy. This is how beyond insane this movie is... Samuel L. Jackson goes from this stern, uptight guy to a bully, to a chainsaw maniac killer, to just plain psychotic, and honestly this guy is never given a solid reason why he turns this way, you're just left with five million questions and on of the worst endings I've ever seen.Chris and Lisa, an inter-racial couple, the nicest couple you will ever meet, the couple you would love to be friends with finally got a home of their own in what seems like a very nice neighborhood... well, that is until they meet Able, their black widowed neighbor who also happens to be a police officer... who also happens to not approve of their relationship. From the get go Able is pretty much a rabid dog who threatens Chris off the bat saying to leave the neighborhood and that he doesn't like them. He just cannot be reasoned with, when Chris and Lisa have an unexpected surprise they were not ready for that gives their marriage a shake, Able isn't helping when he goes as far as to threatened their lives.Honestly this is one of the worst films I have seen this fall season, it was beyond unrealistic and you have no compassion for some of the characters. Not to mention there is a constant rubbing in your face of the race issues, it's not just Samuel L. Jackson that doesn't approve of this relationship, all of the family and friends make some kind of disrespectful comment on it, I personally know 3 inter-racial couples and they don't receive that much hate or disapproval, it was hurtful on that level. I recommend you stay away from this movie, it's slow paced and the thrills are a let down. The story doesn't make much sense and I just found it to be pointless.2/10 1"
Ghost Town             ,Vic_max,0,misc,2008,NA,"While this movie is comedy, it's not really a major ""laugh-fest"" or anything - but it is very well done and interesting to watch. If you're a fan of Ricky Gervais, he's only an actor here, not the writer or producer - so don't expect lots of Gervais-inspired humor. However, do expect a clever and charming romantic comedy.Basically, the movie is about a dentist (Gervais) who temporarily dies during a routine medical procedure. This experience gives him the ability to see all the dead people who are milling about. One of them is resourceful enough to get Gervais' character to interfere with his former wife's engagement ... and the story progresses from there.Gervais puts in a great performance as the socially repugnant dentist. Unpleasant as he is, he's fun to watch and you want to see what his every next move will be. Greg Kinnear (who plays the ghost pressuring Gervais) does a good job too; he's pretty believable in his role. The other characters are more or less one-dimensional and not quite as interesting. However, together with Gervais and Kinnear, everyone more or less of shines.While the story is a bit predictable, the interesting characters, charming nature of the tale and all-around quality of movie-making make this film worth a watch."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,russcampbell-1,0,animation,2009,4,"This was a movie that was ""just there."" I remember being doubtful about Ratatouille. After all, rats and food? Didn't sound like the best combo, but Ratatouille grabs you and pulls you in. Not Despereaux. I was waiting for it to happen, but I was sorely disappointed. The plot was meandering and had no drive to it. I think I chuckled at one thing during the movie, but mostly it was devoid of humor. My kids may have laughed once, too. They didn't leave with the normal ""can we get that on DVD"" questions. You're waiting for something to happen, for something to peak your interest, for a little heart palpitation, a little humor, an interesting plot twist. It's just not there. One person called the movie a ""hack job"" on the book. I can't speak to that, since I did not read the book, but I hope - for the author's sake, at least - that the book was better. I'd recommend that you wait to rent this movie. Your kids may like it, but I doubt they will find it as good as Ratatouille, Cars, Shrek, or some of the other quality kids films, so don't waste your money in the theater. For a $5 rental, it's OK. But for the big bucks they charge at the theater, no way!"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,mikelbarnett,0,animation,2008,1,"As long as there's been 3d technology, (1950's I think) there's been animation made for it. I remember specifically, a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it. I don't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus, was feeding an elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts. This was made to watch in 3d probably 1960's. If you happened to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it's origin. There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses. This claim was a bad move because it's not difficult to prove them wrong. On top of that, this just looks like a bad movie"
Changeling             ,littlemartinarocena,1,misc,2008,7,"The production design and Angelina Jolie's performance dominate this lengthy but rushed tale by director Clint Eastwood. Los Angeles 1928 is truly stunning. We walk the streets of a Los Angeles we've never seen but it looks and feels eerily real. The magic of CGI used to its best advantage. Then, Angelina Jolie, giving a mature and powerful performance as the victim of a disturbed mind and a corrupt police force. Then, the rest, doesn't seem well thought at all. Doesn't Angeline have a photograph of her son to show everybody that the child delivered by the police is not her son? The children, all of them, look and sound like performers of an elementary school theatrical production. Why I wonder? When the period details in the movie are so accurate, why the heaviest of details, the credibility of the supporting performances, are so weak. The writing doesn't help. The baddies are totally bad and the goodies are totally good. Jeffrey Donovan's corrupt cop is really unforgivable. So on the nose without nuances of any kind. Terrible really and very, very annoying. ""Changeling"" however survives its movie of the week heart, thanks to a truthful and compelling Angelina Jolie. I'm repeating myself I know but so does the film."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,reginald-anselm,0,animation,2012,9,"This movie has its good and bad sides. The first thing that really annoyed me was the behavior of the battle droids.

I am a very, very acceptable person and I did really enjoy this movie and the comedy, but the behavior of the droids was just... illogical. Secondly, at the beginning of the movie, Obi-Wan and Anakin discuss how Anakin should put in a *something* for a new Padawan. What?! Jedi Knights choose their Padawans after long observation and consideration and meditation, they don't go shopping for them. And Ahsoka's personality did not fit her ENTIRE LIFE's training.Well, another bad thing was the era. The Clone Wars have been done to death. If one would make a cartoon series, then I think a good place to start would be A - The time between Episodes I and II or before Episode I. B - The time after Episode VI(the Jedi Knight games' era).But now that this has been said, let me say that there are a few things that I really did not like about this movie. 1. General Grievous only got a 3 second cameo. 2. Asajj Ventress. Again. While his interaction with Obi-Wan is fun in later CW seasons, I just don't like the idea of Sith Lords having Dark Jedi bodyguards at all. 3. The cover of the DVD has Yoda brandish a lightsaber. We never saw Yoda wield his lightsaber in the movie. 4. Chancellor Palpatine looked ugly. I mean, this is the character whose grandfatherly smile re-assured the entire Republic after all. 5. What are the chances of Ahsoka staying alive by the end of the Clone Wars? 3720 to 1. 6. Lack of proper traditional R2-D2 and C-3PO banter. 7. Obi-Wan gets underused in the second half of the movie. 8. Ziro speaks English(sorry I mean Basic)????????? 9. Lack of proper traditional badass villain(Dooku was not rly badass in this movie)."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,blackburnj-1,1,misc,2008,7,"The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (awful) or the television series, ""The Tudors"" (soft-pornographic trash), then it is ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film ""Longford"" and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"", his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.That's not to say that it isn't entertaining. Far from it, the film is, for an hour and a quarter, perfectly pleasant, with intrigue, scheming and romance aplenty. A lot of the credit must go to the performances, which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Natalie Portman is impressive as Anne Boleyn. She ranges from scheming and nasty to genuinely sympathetic. It is her most notable work to date. Scarlett Johansson is fine, but everybody is still waiting for her to realise the potential she showed when she announced herself on the scene in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"". The supporting cast are a joy to watch. Eric Bana is excellent as Henry VIII, but it is the schemers in the background who provide the best entertainment. David Morrissey is having a lot of fun, whilst Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are great as the Boleyn parents.It is a perfectly bearable watch, but unfulfilling. There's an awful lot crammed into the hour and fifty minutes. As year after year of history is skipped through, the film's focus continually shifts, failing to allow certain characters from gaining appropriate intensity. Henry VIII is not as proactive as he might, or should, be. He is more driven then driving, whilst his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), is given very little time on screen, thus sidelining a character which should be a figure of great interest. But your expectations are dashed mainly because the film reaches its climax with half-an-hour to go, with an emotional pinnacle being reached and never again surpassed. A rape scene, which seems to be the start of the culmination, with so many points of interest going on in it, proves to be the end of it. The last thirty minutes, whilst quite stylish, are drawn out and slow, and end with a final scene that can only be described as cheesy.It's a shame that this film is nothing more than admirable in places. But it is a good film for this time of year (that springtime lull between the quality of Winter and the bombast entertainment of Summer). It is an entertaining and satisfying way to pass an afternoon, but it won't live long in the memory. "
Goodbye Solo             ,Chris Knipp,0,drama,2009,9,"This third feature from Iranian-descent North Carolinian Bahrani takes a theme from Abbas Kiarostami's 'The Taste of Cherries,' of a man seeking a driver to help him commit suicide, and makes it as American and Edward Hopper as night movie ticket windows, sleazy motel rooms, road houses, cabs on call, and fractured families. Bahrani's surefooted story blends elements of Kafkaesque nightmare and shaggy dog story and, though well grounded in realistic, no-nonsense images and everyday settings, is also surrounded in mystery. What's behind this plan of William (Red West) to be driven from Winston-Salem to the windy heights of Blowing Rock? We only know that he has some sketchy relationship to a boy selling tickets at a movie theater, has sold his house, and then, helped by the cab driver, grimly moves into a cheap motel room with a few belongings.For a driver, William has somehow gotten saddled with Solo (Souleymane Sy Savane), a friendly and garrulous Senegalese with a Mexican wife, Quiera (Carmen Leyva), and a clever little stepdaughter, Alex (Diana Franco Galindo. Quiera is pregnant with Solo's child, but they are at odds over his plan to become a flight attendant, and Solo seems half in and half out of the house. From the evening when William gives him a hundred dollars as advance on a $1,000 payment to take him to Blowing Rock on a set day, which he strongly suspects is to do away with himself, Solo refuses to let the gruff old man alone. He takes William out to play pool and drink and then sleep it off at his house. When his wife objects he moves into William's motel room for a while. He makes sure no other drivers from the W.C.C. cab company pick up William. William is trying to shut down, but Solo won't let him.After a while you realize the focus is not so much on what will happen to William as what will happen to Solo, that Solo's own situation is shaky, mysterious, and perhaps desperate, and that you're not going to find any ultimate answers about either of the two men who are now so oddly conjoined. The key to the story is the story, and Bahrani makes excellent use of the inner and outer nature of his two principals and their checkered careers. Red West was a Marine, stuntman, and boxer, and later a bodyguard for Elvis Presley, and his face has a John Ford cowboy hero's weathered graininess. When he lights a cig and stares into space it's no act. Sy Savane is a one-time fashion model and African TV star and a Winston-Salem cab driver who was a flight attendant for an African airline. He knows the answers to the flight attendant exam Solo's studying for, except that Solo fails the interview. He is athletic and handsome and the radiance of his smile suffuses his whole face. But for all his confidence there's a sense that Solo's dodging about the edges of Winston-Salem because he has friends on the dark side, but he's still an outsider. Bahrani's previous 'Chop Shop' focused on Latino kids eeking out a living amid the competing de facto car parts dealers in the Iron Triangle of Willets Point, Queens. Here he takes it all back home, because North Carolina is where he grew up, even if he felt like an outsider. 'Goodbye, Solo' feels more securely grounded but also more open--an impression visually underlined when Solo drives Alex and William out into the softly multicolored mountainsides around Blowing Rock.The virtue of the film is that it focuses so simply and wholeheartedly on its actors and their characters. There is no quirky Jim Jarmusch wit in the taxicab scenes, never any loss of focus on the confused urgency of Solo's and William's divergent quests. The conclusion may leave you feeling lost in uncertainty amid the fog and whirling winds of Blowing Rock. There's nothing particularly neat or tidy about this ending. But the whole movie is worth the long look William and Solo give each other before they part for the last time. This moment more than the rest of the movie conveys a sense of Bahrani's attention and curiosity--which come with a healthy awareness that he hasn't got the answers, but he has got a grip on some of the big questions by now. Though he gives us only a piece of the puzzle, his interest in new immigrants is admirably free of indie cuteness or dramatic flourishes, and the whole movie is edited with a sure and classic touch that makes this feel like the second great American movie of the year about real people, after James Gray's 'Two Lovers.'"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,moossaboossa,0,adventure,2010,8,"There are movies, such as this and many others, that sometimes don't appeal to people do to the slowness of it all. Nonetheless, I was surprised to see the low rating that it received. The Yellow Handkerchief tells the touching story of three broken individuals, each with their own troubled past and lingering issues; who share one thing in common: the need to escape. The entire plot is centred around a long car journey, in which Martine (Kristen Stewart) and Gordy (Eddie Redmayne)slowly unravvel the mystery of Brett Hanson (Willian Hurt) an unhappy man, recently released from his sentence in prison. The movie is an Indie movie, and it does appear to be rather slow. The script isn't as chatty or invasive as the blockbuster movies we're used to, and there is a lot of scenery. But regardless, the theme of the movie is easy for people to relate to. You don't have to be a convict, or an abandoned child to understand it- the entire story, is about making mistakes. And eventually, the message becomes clearer: that the people who forgive you, and offer you a second chance, are those who love you the most. There are so many different ways to see this movie, that I will point out that that's only my interpretation. I highly recommend this movie, but only if you're in the mood for a more symbolic movie rather than fast paced; action packed thrillers.."
The Square             ,therunner42,0,crime,2008,10,"This is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. Joel Edgerton is clearly an amazing talent as he writes and features in this highly unusual version of a somewhat common plot line. The story is full of twists and turns and really keeps you enthralled to the very end. There are high quality Australian actors in this film, who work together to produce some terrific scenes, that are realistic , dramatic and entertaining. The only disappointment was we were one of about five people in the audience. Considering it was a Saturday night and the The Square's first week at the cinemas, I felt very sad for the Edgerton brothers and also worried that if fantastic Aussie films like this one aren't drawing audiences, then what will? Australians need to get behind Australian film, particularly when it is this good."
W.             ,em89072002,0,misc,2008,6,"This film bored me. It's a sad story of a pathetic character. Essentially W's life-story is reduced to a two hour melodrama more suited for a 'movie-of-the-week' TV slot than the big screen.It's understandably difficult to condense anyone's life-story into two hours of film, but a focus on a specific incident or time period in W's life would have allowed for more character development all around. Here, there was just too much of the overall story so as the numerous characters were paraded-out they came across as shallow and two-dimensional.The episodic flashbacks were over-used and made for a pretty choppy film.The rocky father-son relationship was hammered home pretty hard; I was almost expecting W to cry out 'rosebud' in the middle of the night.For what it provides, this film just ran too long; much like the main character's current administration."
The Merry Gentleman             ,SnoopyStyle,,crime,2017,7,"Kate Frazier (Kelly Macdonald) escapes from her abusive policeman husband Michael (Bobby Cannavale). She moves to Chicago living an isolated life avoiding questions about her black eye. Professional assassin Frank Logan (Michael Keaton) is becoming suicidal. She sees his silhouette after his latest kill. Police detective Murcheson takes an interest in her. She befriends Frank over a Christmas tree, not knowing his real job.It's a sad, slow march in the first half. Macdonald and Keaton keep the interest quite well. Murcheson needs a more compelling actor. Keaton takes his first step into directing. He has a steady and confident hand. His performance has the quiet intensity. Cannavale has a great threatening sensibility. I would love to see Keaton attempt another directing gi"
Milk             ,Michael Fargo,0,misc,2008,10,"I had little expectations walking into this film. The trailer for this movie has appeared at almost every feature film I've seen for the last two months. But, the trailer is a facile example of this minutely detailed story of the rise of a leader and his martyrdom. While I'm familiar with the story from other sources (Shilts' ""The Mayor of Castro Street,"" and the 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk""), Gus Van Sant and his cast bring a new immediacy to this story.None involved in this project could have anticipated the political climate of the premiere of this film: Both the hope of the Obama Presidency and the propaganda that helped Proposition 8 win in California. It seems a perfect environment for this story to reach across America.The dignity with which all of this is told and acted is its success. At the same time, it doesn't shy away from the culture of the Castro. Perhaps the greatest compliment is the rendering of Dan White here. He is neither demonized nor excused.We also don't get a white-washed version of Harvey Milk. He's there on the screen with all his foibles and kinks. Although his humanism shines in Sean Penn's unsettlingly accurate portrayal. It was Milk's love of--and impatience with--the rest of us that makes him a legend. And that is center stage in this film.What Van Sant gives us is both humbling and an inspiration. 1"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,TxMike,0,animation,2008,NA,"This was a DVD from my local public library. I enjoyed it more than I expected to. The animation is just superb, and it has a very well engineered surround-sound track. All in all a very enjoyable short movie.The story is set in July 1969 when Apollo 11 was to launch and make its historic trip to the Moon. As history witnesses it did and, even though the 3-man crew were on the Moon for less than 3 hours, it opened the way for possible future exploration of worlds beyond the Earth.The central characters here are all various types of flies. One of them, Grandpa McFly (voiced by the great Christopher Lloyd of BTTF series of movies) told his grandchildren flies his story over and over, how he was on the plane when Amelia Earhart in 1928 flew solo across the Atlantic, and when she fell asleep he saved the day by flying up her nose to make her sneeze and to recover from the dive just in time. That scene is very graphic!Well, the grandkid flies wanted to do something exciting too, and living in Florida devised a plan to hide out in a worker's lunch pail to gain entrance to the Apollo 11 preparations.The animation is really very, very good, and it was fun watching these little animated flies, and listen to their dialog. The animation of the spaceship in orbit and on the moon's surface is very nicely done.SPOILERS: The 3 small flies make it onto Apollo 11 and their fly relatives and friends get to a TV and see them in the background during a broadcast from the space ship. A crisis happens when the Lunar Lander is about to go into Moon orbit when an electrical problem shows its ugly head. The flies find the problem, an unplugged wire, and pool their strength to push the plug in just in time. So, just as Grandpa McFly had saved the historic Earhart flight, these little flies saved the Apollo 11 fligh"
Cook County             ,the_skeptic_reviewer,1,drama,2008,NA,"I went to see this film at SXSW to keep a friend of mine happy and all I can say is...WOW! I'm not a film student or critic by any means. I'm just our average Joe that is not often overly impressed with most of the films that come out of Hollywood. THIS film, though, was well worth my time and I thanked my friend for getting me to see it.Ultimately this film is about good, evil, and finding redemption. Xander Berkeley plays Sonny, a father who has taken a wrong path in life and is trying hard to make up for wasted time and broken relationships. You are not always sure what he is up to or if he will redeem himself or fall back to his old ways, but he finally finds his redemption through sacrifice in a most unexpected way.Ryan Donowho does a very fine job as Abe, a teen in the unenviable position of being his 6-year old cousin's protector in a house full of meth addicts. Abe is doing the best he can and shows a lot of heart, but ultimately the situation is way over the head of somebody with such limited resources and life experience.Anson Mount simply puts on the performance of his career. I can't say enough about what he put on screen. You're not going to like his character Bump, Abe's uncle and the father of a 6-year old girl whose life he seems determined to ruin in the worst way. He is a man who has completely lost any moral compass he may have had. He is the black hole in the cosmic center of this household. There seems to be no end to his addiction and self serving decadence. Mount brings a realism to this character that may well make your blood boil.The film is raw and real. As one other reviewer stated, there are parts of this film that are hard to sit in your seat and watch. However, this is only because you'll want to jump into the screen and do something to change the course of events that define the impending train wreck of these peoples lives.To me this film was a little choppy early which is the only reason I didn't give it 10 of 10, but in the end this is of minor consequence. This film is powerful. If you are looking for a glossed over look at drug addiction, go somewhere else. This film will slap you in the face with it."
Cook County             ,JustCuriosity,1,drama,2008,NA,"Cook County premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. This excellent feature from first time writer/director David Pomes provides a disturbing look at the horrors of Meth addiction which, until now, has been mostly chronicled - if at all - in documentary films. There have been many excellent features on the highly cinematic issue of drug addiction including to name, but a few of the very best, Leaving Las Vegas, Trainspotting, and Requiem for a Dream. Cook County, while not quite as good as these classics, falls into their tradition.One reason that Meth addiction seems to be underreported in the media and rarely seen on screen is that it is a problem of rural America. American films are mostly set in urban and suburban areas and often seem to be barely aware of the existence, much less the difficulties and complexities of life in rural America.The story is a powerful one of a family in the complete meltdown of Meth addiction. The affect of the family crisis on the 6-year-old little girl are particularly disturbing to watch. The script is excellent. The characters and their relationships to each other are well-developed. The acting is excellent - particularly Ryan Donowho is particularly good.The scenes of the characters using Meth that show how it affects their behavior and judgment are compelling and very believable. There are a few places where elements of the plot are left ambiguous and its difficult to tell if the confusion is the result of poor editing or intentional ambiguity. But these flaws are minor and ultimately unimportant.This is an important film and it deserves wider distribution since so many people are unaware of the dangers of Meth addiction."
The Reader             ,editor-131,1,drama,2009,9,"""The Reader"" isn't about the Holocaust, about Auschwitz, about German collective guilt or the guilt of complicit or evil individuals, even though it features a World War II war crimes trial. It is not about a love story, though there is a beautiful, sexy love story depicted in it. It is about the transformative power of art, in particular, in this case, literature. And literature, a teacher at one point in the film says, is centrally about the control of information<U+0097>the protecting, the withholding, the selective disclosing of information (whether by characters in the story or by its narrator). If we accept this thesis, literature is crucially about secrets, and ""The Reader"" is largely, primarily about the harm keeping secrets can do. When Michael (Ralph Fiennes) decides, after all, not to visit Hannah (Kate Winslet) during the trial he is observing as part of his training as a young law student, to press her to disclose to the court the information that would partially exculpate her from the worst, false accusation against her<U+0097>which could lessen her sentence<U+0097>it is hard to figure. But it makes sense if we understand, as above, what the film is about, and see that he has decided to let her harm herself with her pridefully protected secret just as she so deeply hurt him by her refusal to admit the same secret to him. That's why he later doesn't write to her along with sending the tapes. Why, when he asks whether she thinks about the past, he doesn't mean their past, but her own guilty history. Why he is not more tender in that visit. In sending her the tapes, he thus clearly is not re-enacting a lover's tender mercies. He is offering her an avenue to her own richer partaking in the kind of exploration of human moral experience, questioning of choices and, ultimately, self-examination that literature presents opportunity for. And, one surmises, it works<U+0097>additionally prompted by the emotional distance evinced and moral query posed during his final visit to her<U+0097>with the sad but perhaps just twist represented by her subsequent, final choice. He later unburdens himself to his daughter, as, earlier, the lifelong emotional distance he has held himself in in the protection of his own deep secret has earlier been revealed to have harmed her (among others, we must assume), and his relationships with her and them"
One Missed Call             ,Clarinerd0102,0,horror,2008,7,"Prior to going to see this movie, my aunt and I had read several reviews bashing it. So, we went into the movie with considerably low expectations, which may be the reason why it managed to exceed them. Yes, the acting was mediocre, the effects were somewhat cheesy and we were left confused at times. But for what it was, it was actually pretty good. The nice thing about the movie is that aside from 5 or 6 inappropriate words, it is surprisingly fairly decent for pre-teens. There was no nudity or sex, just a little kissing. Another plus is that the detective is very pleasant to look at ;) Hardcore horror flick lovers probably wouldn't enjoy One Missed Call, but if you're just looking for a fun one to squeal through, this is it. It'd be great at a pre-teen/teenage(or older) Halloween sleepover."
Wendy and Lucy             ,dead47548,1,drama,2009,9,"This is minimalist film-making at it's finest. A message film in the most subtle of ways. On the surface it's a simple, beautifully told story of a young woman falling apart due to economic crisis as she is looking for her lost dog. But writer/director Kelly Reichardt imbues her film with this underlying look at the self-centeredness at America. She's not saying that every single person is worthless (there's a wonderful subplot with an old man who helps Wendy), but that the average American is just too focused on their own selves to not even notice this innocent, decent young woman who is falling apart. People walk by and see her sleeping in her car but instead of thinking of what they can do to help, they just laugh and keep walking. Even a seemingly decent person like the mechanic Wendy takes her car to when it brakes down, doesn't notice how far down she is. Or maybe he just doesn't really care.Maybe it would be different if Wendy was openly looking for help, but she isn't. On the inside she is completely falling apart, but she puts on this front of indifference as if everything is alright with her. She tries to reach out to her sister and her husband, but they immediately act as if calling them is begging for a handout so she falls back on the lie that everything is fine in her life. But if you look at her for more than five minutes, you can tell that things are far from decent. Stories like this happen every day and no one bothers to realize it. Throughout the film you can hear, or see a few times, a train rolling through the scene and passing on. Reichardt uses this to symbolize the fact that America just rolls on by people like Wendy who are in such a state of decay, but they are moving too fast to stop and notice that she exists, let alone what a poor state she's in. It's a remarkably intelligent film under the veil of a beautiful story of a woman losing her dog.Reichardt's remarkably subtle, intuitive direction leads this film but it would have been nothing without Michelle Williams' revelatory performance. She brings all of these emotions of anger, depression and even joy at the end right underneath the surface, but then holds them just below. It takes a highly skilled actor to make you instantly realize what's going on inside of them, without allowing themself to pour all of that out. So in the moment where she does breakdown externally, it makes for a much more severe impact than if she had been crying the entire film.I personally found Wendy to be a very relatable character. She's an isolated, lonely person but she's that way because she chose to be. It's not that she thinks all people are worthless, but the people she meets are just so self-centered and uninteresting that she doesn't bother taking the time to try and become friends with them. And likewise, they don't take the time to notice anything about her. Instead she has friendship in her one true companion, her dog Lucy. So at the beginning of the film when she loses Lucy, I wept in sadness. And at the end, when they are finally reunited, I wept with joy."

Goodbye Solo             ,jordan2240,0,drama,2010,5,"I'm afraid I'm with the group who found this to be terribly boring. Perhaps I'm just too stupid for this sort of film-making, as I just don't get it. Character studies are one thing, but is it too much to ask that someone actually do something interesting. Drawn-out facial closeups do not an interesting movie make. After suffering through the first half-hour/forty minutes, someone actually showed some emotion in a scene I can't even remember now, and I thought I was about to see why this movie garnered such lush praise - but I was wrong. Right back to nothing happening. I don't need everything to be wrapped in a neat little package, but it would have been nice to know at least a tiny bit of what motivated the characters to act as they did. Because of this film, my girlfriend will no longer trust my movie selections. I'm lucky I'm not going ""Solo"
Gomorrah             ,crey014,,crime,2008,7,"Garners more respect than a spot on favorites list, ""Gomorra"" chronicles five seemingly disconnected stories with one thing in common: all are heavily influenced by a criminal organization run by the Camorras, an ominous mafia organization with a tight grip on Naples, Italy. Stylishly delivered, with extra kudos on editing and cinematography, Film will no doubt attract fans of the violent underworld, but might be disappointed by its verite approach, even if it perfectly captures reality, as such. Absolute antithesis to depiction from the American mafia, film is gritty and has zero entertainment value but in retrospect, picture was produced with such depressing intentions.Multi plot film features more on characters attracted by the allure of the Camorras than the Camorras themselves. The five stories were plucked out from a novel by Roberto Saviano: the non-fiction that thrived on the best seller's list in Italy. Stories range from a coming of age teenager wanting to be identified with the mafia to a fresh university graduate looking for a promising vocation. Through varying levels of perspectives: from the violent eyed to the diplomatic, ""Gomorra"" stuns as it lists the organization's almost totalitarian control over the underbelly of Italy. It creates the impression of a country rotting from the inside out. With each story written by a different writer, what could have been an interconnection disaster is controlled well by director Matteo Garrone.Ambitiously edited, fine balance between chaos and narrative is clearly defined by Marco Spoletini. First 40 minutes won't bode well for viewers looking for an easy diversion, as it is edited to confusion creating the illusion that the film started midway. Nonetheless, the stories do emerge, to great relief and from there on out, film would have established its style to a keen audience.Cinematography, too is top notch. Marco Onorato paints Italy with a dull set of colors, resembling more of a third world purgatory rather than a honeymooner's travel brochure. Even Venice's bright reds and blues are muted with grey and brown with a hint of overexposure. Overall effect adds stupendously to the film as it gives it a sense of space and absolutely squashes any sense of hope an over-reader might derive.Accuracy is greatly appreciated here. Film tries to blurry lines between dramatic film and documentary with impressive results. Details are all intact: dialogue is accurately more dialect derived, shooting locations seem extracted from a news clip and most thesping is done on dead-on accuracy by first timers.With production values on stratospheric levels, film's overall intention is transparent: absolutely naught empathy is allowed, allowing audiences to soak in the moody atmosphere and simply co-exist with the protagonists clearly tested by circumstance. This will be its main predicament in garnering a more universal success as it asks a lot from an audience whose expectations might lean towards the slick of ""Cidade de Deus"".With everything into consideration, film is too well choreographed that it becomes as intimidating as the organization that it exposes. Multiple plays won't be troublesome as every single detail here has a sense of subtext of tragedy unwilling to be diluted by repetition. However, might only be uncovered by fans willing to revisit.Picture won the Grand Prize of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. 1"
Space Chimps             ,user-27549,,animation,2008,5,"I can say for most viewers in my cinema by their -sighs-, that Space Chimps was a led down. Although SOME bits were ""almost"" half-funny, most of the movie was portrayed through dull characters and not such a good storyline. The disappointing thing was, that this movie could of had so much more to give and un-tapped potential, but instead was just a let down for me.Personally, this movie would not be entertaining for most people above the age of 15+, yet more for families with their little kids.Overall, it was a mediocre, and should be viewed by either kids, or people that like repeated jokes, and already used story lines. Rated 5/10"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,tjschiffer,0,drama,2009,7,"First and foremost, the actors in this film all deliver incredible performances, exactly what you would expect form such names as Julia Roberts, Willem Dafoe, and Emily Watson. I would say that I was surprised by Ryan Reynolds excellent performance but ""Definitely, Maybe"" had already convinced me that Reynolds can shine in a mature, non-comedic role. The cinematography also deserves to be noted and adds to the fact that this movie should have been great.While the character development was somewhere between adequate and amazing depending on the character, this movie absolute lacks a complete storyline. While the father-son relationship is somewhat over unnecessarily overdeveloped, leaving essential all other relationships remaining a mystery. This is extremely true for the odd relationship between Michael and Jane. It was the unbalanced relationship development and less than substantial storyline that left this movie unfinished and full of holes. To me, it felt like waiting for something to happen only to realize during the credits that nothing has, that somehow everything had magically worked itself out during a long blink.I have to give this film a relatively high rating due to the acting alone and the fact that Ryan Reynolds deserves it. I hope to see him soon in any role he chooses, whether it be comedic or dramati"
Prom Night             ,HolyMythos,1,horror,2008,4,"Now I haven't seen the original version, but I can tell you that it's probably better than the remake. The movie's PG-13 rating takes almost all of the thrill and suspense out of the film.The beginning of the movie starts off sudden, but afterwards there's a nice drought of action until the first prom killing. The PG13 rating makes the death scenes quite bland and boring. You won't see the victims actually getting attacked, but you'll see silhouettes and blood smears. That's about it.The characters in the movie make it seem like you're watching a movie of The Hills. The girls are the classic ""dumb blonde"" stereotypes while the men are the typical ""hard jock"" stereotype. Any angst there is between the characters is very dry and holds no real meaning to the overall movie.The plot is very predictable, I sat through the entire movie correctly guessing what was going to happen next and when something good was going to happen.All in all, this is a good movie if you're looking for some good laughs, but overall don't expect to be extremely happy with the final product. Personally I'd wait for the movie to come out on DVD. If you've seen any other slasher film, chances are you could guess every next move in this movie."
I Sell the Dead             ,Woodyanders,,misc,2014,8,"19th century England. Eager young Andrew Blake (a fine and engaging performance by Dominic Monaghan) and his seasoned mentor Willy Grimes (splendidly played with lip-smacking rascally relish by Larry Fessenden) make a living stealing corpses from coffins and cemeteries: The dastardly duo encounter vampires, zombies, and even an alien throughout their fiendish exploits. Writer/director Glenn McQuaid offers a flavorsome evocation of the period setting, does an ace job of crafting a deliciously macabre tongue-in-cheek mood, and ably mines a wickedly funny line in spot-on twisted gallows humor. However, McQuaid's key triumph for sure is the quirky, colorful, and cinematic live action EC Comics-type style and sensibility he brings to the playfully ghoulish material. The natural and likable chemistry Monaghan and Fessenden in the leads really keeps the picture buzzing; they receive sterling support from Ron Perlman as hearty Irish priest Father Duffy, Angus Scrimm as the corrupt and demanding Dr. Quint, Brenda Cooney as gutsy'n'sassy apprentice Fanny Briers, and John Speredakos as the fearsome Cornelius Murphy. Richard Lopez's sumptuous widescreen cinematography provides an impressively handsome and baroque look. Jeff Grace's robust score hits the spirited spot. A real trea"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,Otoboke,0,animation,2008,NA,"The 3D animated film is certainly not a new idea, and while the extent of applying real 3D through the use of glasses dates back to before Toy Story graced our screens, the technology has been somewhat underused. This is no coincidence however, as most will agree that with 3D glasses, along comes gimmick at the expense of story or narration. Fly me to the Moon certainly doesn't do much to shun away such allegations, as the experience is essentially a lame excuse to try out some really nice looking 3D effects and animation, but it is this impressive aesthetic that gives the film life that it would never have had before. Through this extra dimension the movie achieves a sense of compulsion with the viewer, engaging on a level only touched on by the greatest of cinematographers; Fly me to the Moon certainly feels like a trip into outer space, and on this basis alone should you decide whether or not to give this one a try.Outside of the obvious sensory appeals of the film, the remainder of the much more standard and straight forward elements of film-making are dull and uninteresting in comparison. The story, which follows a trio of youngster fleas as they go on a brave adventure into space through means of hitchhiking in astronauts helmets, has its wonderful moments which will be sure to resonate with anyone interested in space travel. Although once again, without the punctuation of the wonderfully animated environments and smooth, crisp character designs, such moments would probably be fruitless; a little like watching a grainy, black and white version of 2001 with the sound switched off on the ten inch display. Nevertheless, the characters, although extremely standard fare for children's movies, provide adequate motive for the film to move forward and keep exploring all the images of space that lie ahead. The adventure is nonsensical, overly contrived and more than predictable, but for children at least, it will provide some entertainment. For the adults, it's all really just a timid excuse to watch all the glitter fly around on screen.Where the film begins to lag behind however lies in the tacked on subplot involving some seedy Russian antagonists out to blow the moon-mission out of sheer jealousy. Although the depictions of Russia at the time is a little distasteful, lacking the needed comical edge to win over the audience in regards to their obviously caricature nature, this isn't the major flaw inherent to the development. Instead rather it is simply that it lacks any real coherency and fails to establish any sense of relevant link to the much more engaging main plot. Plus, taking place largely inside the brown hues of wherever these fleas live, and lacking any real amusing characters outside of ex-adventurer Grandpa, the segments which are spliced in between all the adventure and action feel perfunctory for the sake of maintaining standard structure expected of the genre and all the more uninteresting as a result.In the end, whether or not you will enjoy Fly Me to the Moon depends on two factors: what age you are and what your disposition is in regards to 3D movies. While it would help to be under your teens and be fond of the three-dimensional gimmick, there are nevertheless other areas in which the movie can please. The main focus being that of space exploration and living out your dreams at the cost of risking your normal, everyday life is always playing out in the subtext of the film, but its presence is palpable enough to warrant engagement with all that is going on behind the fancy effects. Sure enough with such films as Space Chimps and big-shot WALL-E not long behind cinema goer's minds, it would be hard to justify another trip into space without having some serious backing from other elements within the film. In this respect, Fly Me to the Moon too often fails. With an overly formulaic script, flat character development and some spotty plotting, the feature does little to convince you that it is anything but a treat for the eyes. So unless you really enjoy your animated-children's-3D-space movies, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this, but there is still fun to be had here for those who are.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.ne"
Saw V             ,bt-16,0,crime,2008,1,"Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures...what the crap! I'm offended.""Saw V: What happened?"" Did you run out of money? Listen...I realize it's just a movie. But when you have the four before it and you set a certain expectation, there is just no excuse for what we just sat through. I have seen movies made for $7,000 that had more substance than one single frame of this movie.Score was mostly reused from 3 and 4. When you could hear it at all.Unrivaled pacing problems.There were massive technical problems. Looks like the digital intermediate never got finished.Better than 80% of the movie is just reaction shots with no dialog. People standing around staring at stuff and each other. The other 20% is Straham SAYING THE PLOT OUT LOUD.Speaking of which, this movie was very short. Am I correct when I guess that there were somehow massive problems with the movie and you guys went back and added Straham infodumping the plot and just took out the action and replaced it with dialogue-less reaction shots because there wasn't time to do anything else? - Did that include editing out the third act in its entirety? - Did you guys hold the Saw IV special edition DVD until after this movie was released so you could recoup losses from this movie because people will be so angry about 5 that they will be GLEEFUL to buy 4 on DVD? - Did you re-edit it in such a way that you knew you were going out on this one so you just tried to make do if you *HAD* to go out like this? - What in God's name happened? How can a movie be messed up this badly? It's like...you have the SAME crew. HOW DO YOU SCREW SOMETHING UP THIS BAD!? Anyways, Saw was fun while it lasted. They just messed up on this one big time. The whole movie is a disaster. We lost half the audience at the midnight screening in the third reel (when nothing was happening on screen...like most of the movie).There was no twist. There was nothing intellectual. Jigsaw said things he would never say. The characters had no arcs, and they would go between being crazy and entirely coherent. Again, there was no third act. The ending was lame.Normally, people cheer at the end. At our midnight screening, people just looked around and stared each other like it was a joke.It was the kind of screening that was SO BAD that people called their friends because they had to tell someone how unbelievable it was.You guys lost me on the Saw franchise. Sorry.1/10 (It was, after all, at least successfully *PRINTED* to film. The one thing they got right.) AVOID"
Adoration             ,howard.schumann,0,drama,2009,9,"Atom Egoyan's Adoration weaves a complex tale of a young man searching for the truth about his family by perpetuating a lie in order to witness its consequences. Simon (Devon Bostick), a young high school student, tells his class that his Lebanese father Sami (Noam Jenkins) was a terrorist who attempted to blow up a plane with a bomb carried by his pregnant wife, Rachel (Rachel Blanchard), a talented violinist. In his presentation to the class, Simon says that he is the unborn child, his mother was the innocent being led to her demise, and his father was the killer out to murder 400 innocent people to promote a cause. The only problem with the story is that it is not true. The incident never happened. The film exposes the ease with which people are willing to accept what they are told without question and how modern technology has become a useful tool for those eager to disseminate falsehood.According to the director, the film is ""about people dealing with absences. He (Simon) imagines having a father who is a demon; he wants to go as far as possible into what that might mean."" Adoration begins with an indelible image  a young woman standing at the end of a pier overlooking a river playing the violin while her husband and young son watch in awe. Moving forward and backward in time with great ease, the film slowly constructs the events which have led to Simon's school confessional. The key player is Simon's French teacher Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian) whose own family was killed in Lebanon by a terrorist attack. Sabine reads an article to the class about an incident that occurred in 1986 in which a Jordanian man, Nezar Hindawi, sent his pregnant Irish girlfriend on an El Al flight with a bomb in her handbag, of which she had no knowledge until it was discovered by Israeli airport security.Heavily influenced by his bigoted grandfather Morris (Kenneth Walsh) to believe that his father intentionally caused his mother's death in a car crash, the vulnerable Simon constructs a parallel between the article read by his French teacher and the death of his parents. On his own, Simon posts his fake story on the Internet and has to deal with emotional responses from holocaust victims, holocaust deniers, students, and professors talking about terrorism, martyrdom, and heroism. It is a discussion that often sinks to the level of victimization as portrayed by veteran actor Maury Chaykin who blames the bogus airplane incident for ""ruining"" his life. Simon's uncle, Tom (Scott Speedman), who raised the boy after his parents' death, acts as a mediator between his nephew and the teacher who encourages Simon to tell his fake story in the school auditorium.Tom is a tow truck operator with a short fuse who harbors a deep resentment against his father for the way he was treated as a child and his encounters with Sabine contain some of the film's most intense moments. Aided by a tenderly evocative violin-prominent soundtrack by Mychael Danna, Adoration is an intelligent and imaginative study of family conflict and reconciliation that serves as a compelling probe into human behavior and the ability to distinguish between fact and fiction. Though it contains a great deal of ambiguity and character motivations tend to be somewhat mystifying, Adoration is a very involving film with performances that are uniformly excellent, particularly Arsinee Khanjian as the emotionally-damaged teacher and Speedman and Bostock who provide enough tension to keep us riveted throughout."
The Escapist             ,Robert_Woodward,,crime,2008,9,"Rupert Everett's new film, The Escapist, is a gripping prison break drama. Beginning in explosive fashion with the instigation of the escape attempt, the film switches back and forth between two chronologically distinct narratives: the story of the escape and the story behind the escape. The result is an inspired combination of grim realism and comic-book adventure.The escape attempt is hatched when Frank (played by Brian Cox), an elderly and world-weary inmate, receives his first letter in fourteen years, informing him that his daughter has become a drug addict and that her health is failing. When Frank decides that he must break out and see her before it is too late, a number of other outsiders fall in with him, each having their own reasons for trying to escape.The prison is an intimidating place, effectively ruled by inmate Rizza (a menacing turn by Damian Lewis) and his obnoxious brother Tony. Drug dealing is rife and the new inmates are subjected to a trial of humiliation and catcalls. The prison guards are mostly complicit in these activities, offering little protection for outsiders and dissenters. In a brutal demonstration of power, Rizza forces a disobedient junkie to cut off his thumb with a knife as an act of penitence. This is one of several jolts delivered to remind the audience that the prison setting is not just there for their entertainment: it is frighteningly real.There are a number of fine performances in the lead roles. Ralph Fiennes is excellent in the role of Lenny, a menacing, violent inmate who becomes a brave and resourceful hero during the escape attempt. Tony is a memorably revolting villain, played with aplomb by Steve Mackintosh. But it is Brian Cox who deserves the highest praise. The crucial, wordless scene where he comes face to face with his wife in the visiting room is powerfully understated and typifies his performance.On the other hand from the grim reality of the prison, the escape attempt is a taut and exciting adventure. The escapists use improvised gadgets to make their way through the subterranean caverns that they hope will lead to the outside world. The scenery, from long underground tunnels, to cavernous sewers to a disused underground station is often spectacular and the camaraderie that develops between the five men is deeply affecting.The two strands of The Escapist, the story behind the prison break and that of the prison break itself, are expertly juggled throughout. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout, and the film often segues between the two narratives at unexpected junctures. I will not attempt to spoil the final twist, but it is one of those great moments in cinema where all sorts of details in the preceding film fall into place (and continue to fall into place when it is all over).Apparently the prison scenes in The Escapist were filmed in a prison-turned-museum that was restored to its original appearance for the film shoot. It is a superb location, with enclosed walkways criss-crossing the central space and a dramatic spiral staircase that Everett uses to great effect in several set pieces. What struck my friend who accompanied me to the cinema is that there are no windows for the prisoners to look out of, only a skylight in the distant ceiling. Daylight takes on an almost mystical property as the escaped prison inmates strive to escape the subterranean passages adjoining the jail.The sound and music in The Escapist are also deserving of high praise. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch includes a thunderous theme tune and creates tension by use of frantic percussion. The sounds of the prison by day and by night are exceptionally well done, helping to create a stifling, claustrophobic world that encroaches on the minds of the viewers. By the end you cannot help rooting for the escapists"
Adoration             ,Rodrigo_Amaro,0,drama,2010,8,"Atom Egoyan's film ""Adoration"" is a complex and emotional story about how little lies can be dangerous and how the truth always will triumph at the end but with a little bit of pain. In this thrilling story almost like an emotional and frantic time bomb waiting to explode Egoyan present us conflicted characters trying to figure out how to deal with their emotions, losses, their concepts of truth and lies, understanding and love. To the audience it is a spider's web not very easy to follow where you always keep asking more and more questions about how this story is gonna end.In the story Simon (Devon Bostick) is a teenage boy who during a school task is asked by his French and Drama teacher Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian) to add intensity to its Drama exercise and present to the class as if all the things he was reading was true. Notice: it was lesson about a terrorist couple who exploded themselves in a airplane and Simon pretends to be the son of this couple. All that he says looks like the truth, he shocks the whole class and makes the teacher very impressed but it's not. He lives with his uncle Tom (Scott Speedman) a hard working guy with many financial problems; and Simon's parents died in a car crash and he not knows too many things about them. The story gets dark when suddenly Simon shares his fake story in a chat room sort of like if he was testing people's reactions about the story of the poor boy whose fathers died in a terrorist attack. This part of the film gets totally unconvincingly specially when Simon talks to other teenagers and we see their opinions, very annoying. Once again not a real deal of what teenagers really think and act, very phony. If you look closer you will notice that Simon almost doesn't replies to the other people, letting themselves talk what they want, mostly because he knows his parents past is not true, but he wanted to know how bad he could felt if people said bad things about his mother and father. But he gets that experience with his dying grandfather (Kenneth Welsh) who didn't liked Simon's father (Noam Jenkins) an Arab. Even with that he stays the same, trying to figure out who their parents were and the story behind the violin, one of the most precious treasures they left for him. Egoyan chooses to tell this story in a very non-linear way, pretty much like a puzzle with many missing pieces and in the end you'll get a very beautiful picture. This is very important, having the story presented in a linear way it would spoil the whole mystery behind everything. Although some connections are forced, situations seems very unbelievable and non convincing at all and the audience has to swallow it down if you think in another way thinking that it's just a film and things like that doesn't happen in real life you'll enjoy it. ""Adoration"" is also enjoyable for the excellent performances of the casting. Arsinée Khanjian is wonderful playing the teacher and the mysterious woman who visits Simon's house dressed as Arab. My only reservation comes to the acting of the main lead actor. I think that Devon Bostick was a good and a bad choice for the role of Simon. Good because a more famous young actor would be too distractive to play this role. And bad because I found him dead on scene, with lack of expression (although he's cute), but that might be because the script wanted a young guy with few emotional response. Speedman surprised me a lot with a strong dramatical role, and the few scenes of veteran Kenneth Welsh are excellent and the way his character's behavior turns from a dedicate grandfather to an hateful person is shocking. Brilliant study of character but not much believable. 8/"
Kung Fu Panda             ,jakubs-2,0,animation,2008,10,"One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,mgeorge-4,,adventure,2008,NA,"According to the above synopsis, this ""indie"" pic derived from one of the most vivid and persuasive first novels of the last 25 years or so has changed the main characters essential dilemma, which was not choosing between two girls while the romantically self-destructive Cleveland hovered on the edges before bringing things to a head, but figuring out if his close friendship with Cleveland's gay friend Arthur (Art/Arthur, get it?) was sexual attraction or merely bromance. ""Jane Bellwether""! Why not call her ""Schwing Bothways"" or ""Girlgirl Akshun""-- they're much more evocative names. What were Peter Sarsgaard and Mena Suvari thinking"
Iron Man             ,sidfargas,0,action,2008,NA,"All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Mark my words, Iron Man is such a movie. I've been privileged enough to view an advanced screening and, honestly, it's the best big budget movie that I've seen in many years. It hits a high standard of excellence for mass audiences by combining humor, a smart plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. The special effects and CGI are probably the best I've ever seen in terms of relatable effects. They're not over the top and don't overwhelm your senses. What's even more remarkable is this movie will surprise a lot of people with its depth while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Iron Man delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Street Kings anyone?) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Downey himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Downey has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed his performance.Minor SPOILER....My only real complaint is the rumor of a Sam Jackson cameo was not fulfilled. He is even listed here as playing the character of Nick Fury. He did not appear in the cut that I saw. After browsing, it's been offered that his cameo was probably just removed for the early screenings. I hope that's true and they put it back for the final cut. This means I'll just HAVE to see this movie again. LUCKY ME! 1"
Pathology             ,preppy-3,1,crime,2008,9,"Ted Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) joins the pathology department at a major New York hospital. He quickly discovers that some of the pathologists have a deadly game--they kill people in devious ways and see if the other pathologists can figure out how. Jake (Michael Weston) draws Ted deeper into the ""game"" and things slowly get out of control.To say this movie is disturbing is putting it lightly. The sick game the other pathologists play is disgusting--but it seems somewhat plausible. Seriously--who KNOWS what happens to your body after you're dead? Also the sequences of them cutting open dead bodies takes a strong stomach to get through. Aside from Ted the movie doesn't have one likable character (I especially hated Griffin) and they're mostly played by unknowns. The only name in the cast (Alyssa Milano) has a very small role. On the plus side this is VERY well acted (Ventimiglia, Weston and Lauren Lee Smith are exceptional), well directed and I was never bored. There's also quite a bit of female nudity and Ventimiglia bares his butt but NONE of it is remotely exciting in this context. And, thankfully, this is the first horror movie in a long time that doesn't have any of those stupid ""jump"" scares. Grim, depressing and just great--one of the first good horror films in a long time. I only give it a 9 because if you look at it closely it doesn't hold together. Still--well worth catching. Let's hope this entire cast makes it big."
The House Bunny             ,kevin_crighton,1,comedy,2008,5,"Shelley lives at the playboy mansion, and dreams of being a Playboy centerfold. The day after her birthday, she receives a letter telling her she has to move out. Ending up at the Zeta sorority house, a house in desperate need of pledges and money to stay open, she helps the girls, all outcasts at college to become sexier to get what they need, while they help her with a guy she has a crush on.....The House Bunny shouldn't work. It's got a mixed message, suggesting that girls need to use their sexiness to get what they need, while at the same time saying being yourself, with some confidence, and you can get the same. So in that sense I don't think it completely works.However, it is very funny in places. Anna Faris is showing herself to be a very funny actress, and keeps the humour coming through-out. Hers is the best performance here. The actress's who play the girls in the house are all different, but give good performances too, with the possible exception of Emma Stone as Natalie, the girl in charge of the house. It's not that she's a bad actress. I saw her recently in The Rocker and she was very good there. It's just that here, she seems to be trying too hard to portray the 'nerd' side of her character. It's not a bad performance, just a little uneven.The script has some good one-liners in it, and director Fred Wolf keeps things moving at a brisk pace. It's not the funniest teen comedy I've seen, but it has enough moments to keep you smiling, and for it's running time is an enjoyable movie."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,kari_d,1,drama,2008,7,"I surprisingly enjoyed the movie more than I thought and would give it a solid 7. It was well scripted, the filming was fantastic, and the acting was good - it was a very pleasant movie. I read the book, so I knew what the plot was about, so no surprises there (although I wish it included one detail that was in the book about the shooting). There was nothing truly spectacular or exciting to give it an 8 (but nothing truly spectacular happens in the book either, so the movie couldn't really change that), but nothing terrible/poor script/poor acting, which you usually find a bit of in a 6 or 6.5 stars. I saw it in the theater and it was the perfect ""girls night out"" movie. Also good for mother/daughter. Otherwise, wouldn't pay $10 to see it. It would be a great rental - see once and return."
The Women             ,maureenmcqueen,1,comedy,2008,2,"To say I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur film made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions (something I've never done)I was stopped by Cloris Leachman really. She rings true, the only one I should say. This new women are less modern than the George Cukor women of the 30's. This ones are ""acting"" for us trying to be with it but their ""conflict"" is exactly the same as it has always been, in movies anyway. The fun of the original was based on a crisp, vitriolic and very funny script. A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. All the elements that are missing here. TV actresses mingling with models and Oscar nominees/winners. There wasn't anything organic about it. The whole thing felt like a put on, improvised in the moment without a clear objective. 2/10 "
The Merry Gentleman             ,iwishicouldthink-1,,crime,2009,NA,"The Merry Gentleman is one of the most patient and subtle American films I've seen in some time. It involves two characters who will meet, who both have secrets, and who are both alone. We know their secrets. We know their predicaments. This film is not about plot, suspense, mystery, but about two people and their relationship.Frank Logan is a hit man. No film that I can instantly recall has told such a subtle and human story about man of that occupation and it has been covered extensively. We have our hit man comedies, we have our hit man dramas, we have our hit man action, we have our hit man at a crossroads stories, we have our idiot hit men, we have our desperate hit man stories. The list is so substantial that making a film about a hired hand is almost one of the least original stories that could exist. Merry Gentleman seems to have contradicted that claim though, but it does so by not making it the centerpiece of the film. We see Frank Logan kill. We know Frank Logan kills others during the film. However, he could just as easily not be a hit man. In this film his being a hired killer is only a device to meet the character Kate. That we don't look at him as a hired killer, don't think of him like that, is the genius of him happening to be one.Kate Frazier starts the film leaving her husband. She was beaten. Again, this is a familiar situation in films. We have our full gamut of battered wives films. Kate's story, like Frank's, is not about being a battered wife. Again, it's just a reason for her to leave, to find a new job, a job that when leaving she'll see Frank, standing on the ledge of the building across the street. She yells and startles him to stop him from jumping. He falls backwards. Of course, Frank was on that roof to shoot a man that worked in the same building as Kate. Frank and Kate actually meet when he helps her bring her Christmas tree into her apartment building  a scene that may have been a little forced. Again, Frank is there attending to business and again he encounters Kate. From this point on a friendship is formed.That the film keeps their relationship a friendship is admirable. They both just need a friend. Their lives are complicated enough, although that doesn't stop most films from adding a romantic line when it makes no sense. Kate, naturally doesn't know that Frank was the one on that building, what he was doing there, and why he was really showing up at her apartment. And Frank knows nothing of Kate's reasons for her sudden relocation. Why are so they good for each other if they don't really know each other? The film leaves that open to interpretation. Where does the film go? Well, that can't be explained but it comes to a head when Kate's husband shows up.What is so enjoyable about the film is having way more knowledge than the two characters. We know the secrets of both sides and Keaton lets the film play out so patiently that the film is enthralling. It has its humor, it has a bit of twists, but the film is all about the nuanced friendship that grows between two people and where that inevitably has to lead. We know where this film has to go  the characters have to figure out what we know. Don't they? And when they do what will happen? These are the questions that Keaton allows a very moody atmosphere to hide in the back of our heads while he tells and portrays half of the Frank and Kate friendship.It's always interesting when a long-time actor directs their first picture. For Michael Keaton, who went from decent 80s comedies, to being Tim Burton's go-to guy for a stretch, to a string of mid-90s romantic dramas and comedies, and spending the last ten years appearing sporadically primarily in kids movies, it was hard to know what to expect. It's safe to say that Keaton was never in a film reminiscent of The Merry Gentleman. For an actor that does have a good amount of range but has always been a little spastic and energetic, his performance was impressively understated and well played. His acting mimics the patience and mood of his filming, everything is allowed to happen in its own time.The film makes a point of showing Kate as looking like an angel when Frank looks down at her from the rooftop. Frank regards her as a gift when he finds her trapped under her own Christmas tree. Kate makes a comment halfway through the film that their isn't much difference between a ghost and an angel, one guides you and one haunts you but they both need something. It isn't clear if Frank and Kate are angels and ghosts to each other, but certainly they came into each other lives as we expect angels and ghosts do. We fear they'll have to leave each other just as a ghost and angel would as well. In the film, we'll question whether these characters are real at all, and what does it means if they're not. The ending of this film is as bittersweet as a story about ghost and angels would be. This is a film of sacrifice and of two people being gifts for one another and also of having to be ghosts and angels for each other too.B+ (67.5) @ A Reel Perspective"
The Dark Knight             ,guerillagorilla,0,action,2008,10,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars. 1,313"
The Lucky Ones             ,mr_popcorn,,adventure,2009,8,"Neil Burger's offbeat, quirky, dramatic movie is a triumph. It succeeds in all the aspects, from the technical parts to the acting, I can't find a single negative thing about it. Burger doesn't dilly-dally around, he went straight to the point of his subject, giving a fair amount of time for each of the three characters (McAdams, Pena and Robbins) to develop and eventually you can't help but really like them...a lot. Especially McAdams but more on that later. The script is tightly wound, the chemistry between the three protagonists doesn't seem forced, the movie doesn't force you to like them the moment the movie starts but instead, these colorful characters will gradually grow on you.Tim Robbins, one of my favorite actors, doesn't disappoint. 2008, I have seen him in two movies the other one being The City of Ember. And as long as a movie has Tim Robbins in it, I'm sold. That's why I watched the movie in the first place. Michael Pena, another great guy, gives off a good vibe towards the movie and once you know what's been bothering his character, you can't help but laugh at how one-sided and ridiculous his problem is. Pena gives one of his greatest performance on screen. And of course, the belle of the ball, the star of the show, Rachel McAdams gives a quirky, zesty and joyful performance as a lovable Southerner and I can't help but be reminded of another quirky, zesty and joyful character, Amelie. She just keeps the laughs rolling in and steal every scene she's in. She gives the character such depth that one might come off as one dimensional had it been portrayed by a lesser talent. Definitely an underrated performance for 2008.Highly recommended."
The Square             ,morrison-dylan-fan,0,crime,2012,7,"Recently catching up with a terrific thread on the IMDb Film Noir board,I noticed an IMDb member give a very good review,for an over looked Neo-Noir film from Australlia.Being intrigued by the sound of the movie,and having also enjoyed the great 1987 Ozploitation film Dark Age,I decided that it would be the perfect time to take a look at a Neo- Noir world from down under.The plot:Getting a job as a Foreman for the building of a brand new leisure resort,Raymond Yale starts to plan on ways which he can get extra ""benefits"" for the building of the resort.Holding secret discussions with lead construction work Barney, Ray soon begins to devise a plan that will secretly create ""kickbacks"" during the construction work,which will lead to him getting a nice bundle of extra cash on the side at the end.Despite his plans on how to get hold of the cash that is dangling in front of his eyes,Ray finds any ""spark"" in his life completely fade away when he returns to the suburban home that he lives in with his wife,whose ""spark"" for Ray has also gone a long while ago.Feeling that his marriage is beyond repair,Ray decides to start an affair with a woman called Carla Smith,who lives on the opposite side of a rive near Yale's house.Feeling a sense of danger and excitement that he has not had in ages,Ray decides to ignore the fact that Smith is married to a well known,ruthless local gangster called Greg ""Smithy"" Smith,and to instead start building a deep relationship with Carla,whilst continuing to make sure that no one else in the city catches on to what they are secretly up to.Keeping a good distance away from her husband so that he does not catch her spying on him,Carla sees Smithy secretly hide a duffel bag which seems to contain a huge amount of cash from a bank robbery that Greg has recently committed.Rushing to tell Ray about her thrilling discovery,Smith is left deeply disappointed when Yale tells her that they should just leave ""Smithy"" money alone and just wait for his ""kickbacks"" to get started.Not being willing at all to let the topic drop,Carla eventually gets Ray to agree on setting up a robbery for Greg's hidden money,which will inadvertently give them the very worst ""kickback"" that they ever could have imagined<U+0085>View on the film:For their slowly unravelling,tightly coiled screenplay,writers Matthew Dabner and Joel Edgerton, (whose brother Nash directs this terrific film) initially make the first half of the film a moody suburban Drama,as Raymond Yale, (played by a great David Roberts,who expertly shows Ray transform from being an extremely private individual,to someone who is willing to go to murky limits to keep the pile of cash under wraps) is shown to be completely dissatisfied in the direction that his life has taken.With Dabner and Edgerton having Ray display more affection for Femme Fatale Carla Smith, (played by the great,cunning Claire van Der Boom) than he ever does for his family and friends.Using the suburban setting as the main focus of the movie for the first half,Dabner and Edgerton slowly have the Noir side of the film brilliantly rise up to the suffice,as Ray begins to get a dangerous,paranoid doubt in his mind over which of his family and friends are actually showing their true selves,whist others prepare to increase the tension and stab him in the back,which leads to the film ending on a pure,sudden Black Comedy note.Despite this being his first ever feature film directing debut,Nash Edgerton display a strong style which suggests a bright future hopefully laying ahead of him,as the scenes of Ray getting an increasing feeling of fear,having Edgerton cleverly use a close-up ""floating"" camera to fully display Ray's dangerous ""up in the air"" mood,whilst using the second half of the movie,to create a number of really excellent, tense ""betrayal"" scenes that show Ray and Carla's cunning plans completely burn dow"
Gomorrah             ,soha_bayoumi,,crime,2008,9,"This is one great movie by director Matteo Garrone. It's a living example of contemporary neorealist cinema. Based on Roberto Saviano's homonymous bestseller, the movie explores the world of one of the most atrocious criminal organizations in the world, the Camorra. Using unsophisticated realist cinematography, editing and aesthetics, and through the choice of actors, most of whom are simply local residents of the neighborhood, the movie does throw you mercilessly in this inferno for over two hours, where you can smell the blood, feel the misery of Naples's slums and live that vicious circle of violence, despair and injustice. A masterpiece and must-see!"
Stop-Loss             ,alexbq2,0,drama,2008,NA,"I had an opportunity to attend an advanced screening of this film yesterday in Boulder CO. I am not in any way affiliated with film industry or the critique. I was just a lucky walk in.I've seen a preview of this movie a few days before and was not impressed by the trailer. It looked like another belated anti-war movie (better late then never), with youthful actors looking ruggedly pretty for the camera.What I saw was a fist full of reality mixed with a great story of, I guess, a youth becoming a man <U+0096> not in a sexual way.The plot is obvious from the trailer, so there is nothing I can give away. The ending was not surprising, at least to me. And the ending was both obvious and powerful.The beginning is very life like. If you've seen Gunner Palace, or been to this war, you'll recognize it. It starts in a format of home movies made by soldiers who serve in Iraq. It was apparently based on the films and photographs shot by actual soldiers. Some of this footage was included into these opening sequences, much was recreated by the actors. So it is ultra realistic. The only way to tell them apart is to look for Ryan Philippe, who is good in his role but stands out due to being easily recognizable.The film quickly moves into a war sequence, demonstrating the horrors of war. Do not expect to see the charge of the light brigade. It is not a massive battle, but you will see the bullets flying, and more importantly killing. If you were put off by the violence in Saving Private Ryan, you may want to close your eyes for a few minutes at this point. Past the gun battle we are back in the States. So the Iraq part is only about 20 minutes.The real story kicks in when Ryan Philippe with his war buddies returns home a decorated war hero looking forward to put the past behind him only to find out that his contract was extended by the Stop Loss policy and he is to go back to Iraq. The film does not become boring or preachy. And through the main character's journey both we and he realize that he has very few options: go to jail, abandon (physically) the country and everything he is and has, or go back to war. What choice can he make? So what was my point about the ""becoming a man"" story? Well, the way I see it, the main character's final decision, is not just forced on him. It springs not from fear or just inevitability, but from his sense of responsibility towards his parents and friends <U+0096> I'm not going to say 'country', this has nothing to do with flag waving patriotism. His accepting to go back, is an act of an adult. He accepts all the horror, the risk, the BS, the unfairness. He does it through a conscious decision. The decision is to take care of those who depend on him. That sounds pretty grown up to me.Thanks go out to Kimberly Peirce, who wrote and directed this film. And directly in front of whom I was sitting quietly last night while she was presenting her movie.You also may want to check out Harsh Times, Gunner Palace and The Execution of Private Slovik. "
Trucker             ,Cat21299,1,drama,2010,NA,"This movie has so many political overtones.I wasn't able to get into it.The shirt on the kid, the president in blood and the immigration comment. Come on,what the does that have to do with a female trucker and her estranged kid. The movie's director needs to take a refresher course on staying true to a movie's plot and stop trying to making political statements.The actor ,Michelle Monaghan is a good actress, but Adam Sandler made better use of her in The Heartbreak Kid.This site is seriously in need of a make over, why do we have to have so many words in a post and then you won't allow an exclamation.Geez , the time I wasted on this site will make you shout"
Frozen River             ,nevfahs,1,crime,2009,2,"A lot of people seem to like this film, so maybe I'm missing something, or maybe they find the characters more compelling than I do. But five minutes into it, my eyes began to roll from the laughable portrayal of characters and lifestyles obviously foreign to the writer, and direction that is surpassed daily by 12 year old you tubers. From the opening shot, an embarrassingly long pan of mostly a bathrobe, then a too-tight closeup of the actress doing an exercise from a community college drama class, to the ending, where we are to believe that everything is wonderful now that Dad's disappeared and Mom's in jail. Because now the 15 year old caretaker of his younger brother has a mentally and emotionally challenged woman and her baby to deal with, too. The filmmakers forgot to show any aspect of bonding between this new ""family,"" or what dynamic had made this arrangement beneficial to any of them ,and the fact that the main character expressly told the young mother to buy a ""single-wide"" for them to live in, and the last shot is of a truck delivering half of a ""double-wide, had me more worried than ever about the kids."" Or I should say ""kid"" because the younger boy was as neglected by the film as he was by his mother, who worked in a Dollar store, but still couldn't manage to get the kid a single token gift for Xmas. Bleah.The writer has an irrational fear of propane torches, and to set this up, has a shot of the young man applying the torch to a threaded pipe joint. Wearing welder's goggles. If this is such an important shot, couldn't the writer have at least talked to someone who had ever used a propane torch, to find out, oh, I don't know, maybe what they are used for? The character later uses it to accidentally set the trailer on fire, and later to threaten his gun totin' Mom, who has already shot the Dad in a domestic dispute. Bad move, it would seem.The lead character feeds her kids popcorn and Tang for breakfast and dinner, but buys cigarettes and shoots at stuff when she's annoyed. She spends no time at all with her kids, but only works part time at the Dollar store. We know why she's broke, but we don't know what she does with the rest of her time, except make sad faces at herself in the bathroom mirror and record and re-record the message on her voice mail.Apparently the business of smuggling illegal immigrants is so quick and easy, that I'm surprised more people don't do it. You just drive up to this trailer unannounced, and a guy comes out 5 seconds later with two people who get in your trunk, and he hands you 1200 bucks. Or, if he's out of people, you drive to a Go-Go joint, and the sceptical Russian thug finally walks around a corner (outside, in the frozen North, mind you) and comes out with two Chinese women who were just waiting for someone to show up, I guess. But watch out, because the frozen river you've been driving back and forth across for the last few days is bound to be melting, now that it's night time, where in this world of suspended logic, it gets warmer closer to midnight. Be prepared for long shots of non sequiters, like road signs with no useful information, lots of shots of the road in front of the car, stuff on the bathroom shelf, the inside of a bingo parlor with no meaningful relation to the story. Endless closeups of Melissa Leo's face, that have you wondering whether the director is her stalker, because she can't seem to stay very long on anything else when Leo is in the same scene.Leo's character is a negligent parent, manages to be late for the part time job she depends on, is violent, bigoted and rude, except to the dickhead manager of the dollar store, whose abuses she has endless patience for.There's nothing to like about her or the other lead, who for reasons no one can pretend to have understood, let someone take her baby away, so she hides outside their house and stares through the window at him. When she sees him in public, she walks up to the two women who have him, and stares at him from three feet away. But, using a rare Native American invisibility cloak, the women don't see her.My general impression is that the writer has sympathy for people like the characters, but doesn't really know any. Which is fine, I guess, but it's a mistake to try to show others what their world is like."
The Escapist             ,moviebus,,crime,2009,1,"A exceptionally bad movie which wastes some really good actors in ill-conceived dross.The Escapist is poorly written with an unconvincing plot that steals from every American prison break movie ever made.Unfortunately stealing great scenes from other movies is great if you can make them coherent in your film.A task that was quite beyond this director.The ending is the biggest cop out ever, well since Bobby Ewing woke up in the shower after being killed off a year earlier.Take my word, watch 'The Shawshank Redemption' for the millionth times, of Clint in 'Escape from Alcatraz.' Get the box set of 'Prison Break.'Under no circumstance rent this rubbish."
Sex and the City             ,xylokopos,1,comedy,2008,8,"The last film I saw that offered an equally dark and twisted view of the human psyche, was Pasolini's Salo: a glimpse of something truly dehumanizing and a portrayal of the triumph of evil. SATC works along the same lines, establishing characters without any redeeming qualities, absolutely devoid of decency and empathy. At a certain level, one can see the film as some sort of uber-feminist dystopia, replete with scenes of symbolic castration; or maybe some sort of super-consumerist manifesto, where existence is distilled as lifestyle and an hymn to superficiality; or maybe as a nihilistic social commentary, where self-centeredness and egotism are systematically rewarded.One thing is for sure: it is a deeply disturbing experience for the male viewer. The male characters in this film are gay, sex toys or rich daddy figures. The 4 females leads are predatory, utterly self-absorbed, devoid of any moral compass, guilt-infusing middle aged ""professionals"" - exaggerated caricatures of an equal-rights fantasy gone terribly wrong. It is a combination of American Psycho, In the Company of Men and Fight Club from a female viewpoint - an immature and violent wet dream that is justified based on the "" I am being me"" and ""I love me"" principles. I challenge any man to check out the scene where Kim Katrall's character dumps her boyfriend of 5 years ( that stuck with her through chemotherapy to boot) because she ""loves herself more"" and not get enraged and scared at the vision offered.Of course, a lot of suspension of disbelief is required, since at the same time, the film borders science fiction - it is hard to digest that these women, manipulative as the may be, can actually transform successful and emotionally stable men into pathetic, apologetic train wrecks.If you watched this with your wife and girlfriend and she didn't spot anything reprehensible in the main characters' behaviour, you, my friend, are in deep, deep, deep trouble."
Mamma Mia!             ,moutonbear25,1,comedy,2008,6,"Let me tell you. Just because I've been listening to ABBA almost non-stop since I saw MAMMA MIA! two days ago does not mean I enjoyed the film all that much. It's just the Swedish pop super group's music is so darn infectious. You would think that energy would translate to feel-great good time at the movies but sadly this is not the case. First time feature filmmaker, Phyllida Lloyd, spends far too much time dragging her feet when they should be dancing up and down the beach and no matter how many shots of the moonlight shimmering against the waves there are, the film is still a clunker instead of a stunner.When a musical is paper thin on the stage, it runs the risk of being just plain silly on the screen. On the stage, MAMMA MIA! is a somewhat justified excuse to revive a bunch of ABBA tracks wrapped into a completely implausible, overly romantic farce. Young Sophie (played on screen by Amanda Seyfried) is but 20 and about to marry the very supportive and very handsome, Sky (Dominic Cooper). Something is missing though. Sophie has lived on this tiny Greek island her entire life and helped run a crumbling hotel with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) but she has never met her father. As far as she knows, he left before her mother could say anything to him but a chance encounter with her mother's diary from the summer of her conception narrows the possible men to three. So rather than talk to her mother about her desire to know where she came from, she invites all three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding, pretending to be her mother looking for a reunion. Naturally all three men accept the invite and hijinks ensue. While the campiness of the whole affair is forgiven on stage because the suspension of disbelief doesn't apply, this screen version is too far removed from the stage to feel the least bit plausible.I believe in angels, something good in everything I see. And while there is very little good to focus on in MAMMA MIA!, at least there is always surprising Streep. She jumps up and down on beds, slides down banisters without the least bit of concern for breaking her hip. She can sing too. Much like she did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, Streep's performance as the lonely mother of the bride carries the film forward and, in the show stopping ""The Winner Takes It All"", elevates the film to heights it could never have achieved without her participation. Though the two don't get nearly enough screen time together, Streep and Seyfriend make a great mother/daughter combo. Seyfried's fresh exuberance seems like it might actually be inherited from her movie mom. The rest of the cast delivers varying results <U+0096> Julie Walters clearly thinks she is a comic genius but she comes off too brash; Christine Baranski is miscast as an older bombshell making for some particularly awkward moments with younger men; and someone should ensure that Pierce Brosnan never sings on screen again.Ultimately, MAMMA MIA! never connects all of its components. A melodramatic moment is followed by a peppy ABBA song, which somehow erases everyone's pain. In that sense, ABBA's music is the perfect choice to set the tone as it is some of the most depressing pop lyricism set to upbeat melodies in pop history. While the contrast adds weight to the songs themselves, the musical masking casts an air of falseness that never lifts. What your left with is a compilation of poorly choreographed, plainly sung music videos. No offence, Meryl, but you are long past your MTV days."
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,animaaster,0,animation,2008,10,"You have not seen a 3D film until you have seen this one. Sure the story is predictable. They go to the moon and they come back. That's probably why nobody ever made a film about the Apollo 11 mission. The fly-on-the-wall concept totally works though. The flies are adorable. Real emotions in a computer animated film, that's a novelty! The animation and the sets are first rate. It may not have the finishing touch of a Pixar movie, yet in many ways this film is as groundbreaking as Toy Story 10 years ago. Best of all it was great fun, a truly unique experience for the whole family! As for the 3D, I finally understand what the fuzz is all about!"
Igor             ,Stompgal_87,0,animation,2013,8,"I first saw this film when I rented it four years ago and it was creative but the majority of it was not very memorable. Up until now the only scenes that stood out were those where Igor's creation calls herself Eva when he tells her she was doing evil things and those that referenced 'Annie (of of my favourite musicals as a child).' When I heard this film was showing on Viva (a music and entertainment channel in the UK), I decided to give it another chance and I found it even more entertaining second time around.While the animation was decent and the dialogue was dark and witty, the characters were modelled in unique, surreal ways, although Heidi in particular looked a bit plasticky, a lot of the backgrounds were not as colourful as the characters and props and the special effects were rather cheap. Nevertheless, I found the side-characters of Scamper the rabbit and the robot-and-human-organ-hybrid Brain (mistakenly named Brian once or twice) very funny, the background music's mood ranged from spooky to tense to joyful and I liked the swing/jazz-type songs and the hilarious 'The Bigger the Figure,' a parody of Largo al Factotum from 'The Barber of Seville' as well as the gorgeous end-credits song. The film did remind me of any 'Frankenstein' movie and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' due to the main character bringing a woman to life and having a hunched-back. As for the writing, it had traces of word play (the character of Jaclyn and Heidi being a female version of Jeckl and Hyde, the second I've heard of since childhood favourite 'Julia Jekyll and Harriet Hyde'), irony (the blind orphans singing 'I Can See Clearly Now' at the end) and pop- culture referencing (in particular 'Annie'). I also liked how the Invisible Man was depicted as a TV show guest and commentator but I found the name of the film's setting Malaria rather depressing.Overall, this film was worth a second look even though it doesn't live up to the standards of Pixar and Dreamworks CGI films. 8/1"
The Bank Job             ,janos451,0,crime,2008,8,"If ""The Bank Job"" were fiction, it would be a fairly decent robbery caper. As it is, ""The Bank Job,"" a veritable documentary and realistic whodunit, is awesome. Unlike most films, this one requires a couple of advance tips: First, watch it with the improbable idea in mind that most of it is actual, hard-to-believe truth; second, don't be impatient. As the story of a 1971 bank robbery begins, the setting in London, the parade of seemingly unconnected stories and characters is rather confusing, complex, disjointed. But stay with it - there is a crescendo of excitement and excellence. The true elements of ""The Bank Job,"" some hidden until recently by Britain's ""D Notice"" censorship law (modified in 1993, becoming DA, or Defense Advisory) are these:1. A big bank robbery did take place on Baker Street in 1971, culprits never found, money never recovered. After initial big headlines, the story disappeared from the newspapers. 2. There was serious police corruption in London in the 1970s, cops on payrolls of drug dealers and pornographers.3. Princess Margaret was involved in a series of affairs, some caught on compromising photos which were not published by the otherwise relentlessly sensational British press, under the D-Notice rule. 4. There was a militant British black-power advocate, called Michael X, involved in a one-man, multi-country crime wave. (In 1971, John Lennon paid for Michael X's bail, something not mentioned in the film.)""The Bank Job"" director Roger Donaldson (of ""No Way Out"") brings together all these true threads in a way that may be true even in its totality, director and cast prevailing over some shoddy work from too many writers. The content is all true, the context is excitingly possible. Did the government, in trying to prevent exposure of Princess Margaret by evidence in Michael X's possession, mastermind the bank robbery? Was MI-5 or MI-6 (says a policeman in the film: ""I never remember which is which"") involved, and actually assisting the robbers? Again, possibly. The cast is remarkable: Jason Statham is the ringleader, the bad guy of ""Transporter"" and ""The Italian Job"" turning into a scourge of the really bad guys. Saffron Burrows, James Spader's vamp nemesis on ""Boston Legal,"" brings her remarkable name and looks to the criminally and emotionally ambiguous major female role.Peter De Jersey is a totally scary Michael X; David (""Poirot"") Suchet is a frightening crime lord; and a whole host of top British stage actors fill in big roles and small ones. Don't be misled by reviews speaking of a so-so thriller - ""The Bank Job"" is a great deal more than that, even to the point that you may want to see it more than once. 3"
The Incredible Hulk             ,guringo,0,action,2008,1,"For all the CG brute force on display, this is one lame flop-along of a flic.

The helicopter crash-lands into the church ruins, but try as they might to get out, an unconscious/dead soldier is propped in the only opening so that Betty exasperates in her struggle to escape as the fuselage catches fire (only for Hulk to hand-clap it out)...For all the violence they inflict one on the other, and for all their super-strengths, it's an indestructible chain that allows the Hulk to subdue Abomination. And it's Betty that stops the Hulk from killing him, he's vanquished, right, so just let him be...they'll super-handcuff his ass to a super-cell till the sequel...Every such finale must entail a crowd, no matter how preposterous for people to show up. Hulk departs a la Spidey minus cobwebs... aaga-gaga-gaga..."
Twilight             ,tieman64,1,misc,2013,NA,"""I really like Twilight. It is a very good film."" - Orson Welles The Twilight franchise stars Kristen Stewart as Harry Potter, a wizard who defeats evil Emperor Sauron and so reclaims her position as head of Starfleet's Jedi Order. Based on a series of books by author Tom Clancy, the film would spawn a massive fan-base, members of which often attend conventions dressed as werewolves, vampires and virgins.The first film in the series, Catherine Hardwicke's ""Twilight"" raises many interesting questions, like ""where do babies come from?"" and ""what do you do when two guys like you?"" It's also very original and has nothing to do with sex.10/10 - Masterpiece"
W.             ,junkymail50,0,misc,2009,1,"I'm not a Bush fan, but was disappointed to see this movie be such an obvious one-sided interpretation of hearsay and questionable statements that are used to mock a president. This makes it pretty pointless unless you really just hate the Bush administration and want to see a dramatized version of all the hate made into a mocking movie. Perhaps that is the intended purpose of the film, but it's not marketed in that way, it's marketed as a synopsis of Bush's life which is what makes it a failure. For this kind of mocking film (like Condoleeza Rice's character), it would've been funnier to make it more obviously funny (like a straight-out comedy) instead of trying to make it seem like a normal movie."
A Christmas Tale             ,lastliberal,1,comedy,2009,9,"The film deals with death, but not in a morbid way. One of the queerest scenes involved Abel (Jean-Paul Roussillon), Junon Vuillard's (Catherine Deneuve) husband, and Claude (Hippolyte Girardot), working the statistical chances of survival and the time left if Junon chose to have or not have a bone marrow transplant for her cancer. This is not something I could ever imagine happening anywhere else.Junon was so cool about the whole thing that you never really thought about the fact that she was dying.The entire family, sons and daughters, nieces and nephews, girlfriends, and others arrive at the family house to celebrate Christmas, each with their own funny and not-so-funny issues.The main issue working throughout the entire film is between brother and sister, Henri (Mathieu Amalric) and Elizabeth (Anne Consigny). Both actors were brilliant, and I am still not totally sure of the issues.There were other issues going on, and they are way too numerous to mention. The film deals with family and repentance, and forgiveness, among other issues.Arnaud Desplechin works like no other director I have seen and, while it may be distracting at times, it is never boring. The two and a half hours fly by.The children's Christmas play was hilarious, and dealt with the same themes.This was definitely one of the best films of 2008"
Adoration             ,manuel-pestalozzi,0,drama,2013,5,"Ever since I saw The Adjuster and The Sweet Hereafter I watch every movie by this director I can lay my hands on. This one is visually beautiful, well acted (with a notable exception) and touches important issues of today. And yet it left me rather disappointed. Atom Egoyan is a moralist who demands a lot from his viewers and invites them to check their own instincts. In reverse the viewers have the right to expect clarity and a straight story. Here, the director fails them. The story is too convoluted and contrived. It slows down everything and the whole does not find its proper rhythm. I found Arsinée Khanjian's persona and her performance problematic. It's got a syrupy intensity I found hard to stomach. The rather heavy-handed toying with the exotic is simply annoying. From her first appearance I thought, that person should not be allowed to teach intelligent adolescents. And appearing on somebody's front lawn in full North African (?) garb at Christmas Time? And then being asked to take that character seriously? Well, for me, it was too much. At least it gave me occasion to check my instincts, which is never a bad thing. So the movie may just have served its purpose ."
What Happens in Vegas             ,quirke_j,1,comedy,2008,6,I was in fear of going to see this movie.The reviews were appalling. At the last minute I relented and went expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised after 10 minutes my fears were dispelled and I actually started to enjoy the film. The basis of the film was predictable but the way the 2 central characters draw you in surprised me. They worked very well together and played off each other very well. Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny.I think the best thing about this comedy was that it left it up to the audience to draw their own conclusions on the characters of the central characters without laying (on as Hollywood usually does)it on heavy with the romantic or schmuty character embellishment.Just a funny story with 2 ( 4 including the supporting friends) very good comic actors. Give yourself a break its not overly typical Hollywood flick and I found it funny anyway ! PS I am not a teenager ! 1
Prom Night             ,notebook39,1,horror,2008,1,"I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. I never go by other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? I swear, I'm amazed there weren't any GROUP HUG ^-^ moments.I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English. The clichéd, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gonna happen.And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, ""I have to get my mom's shawl!!!"" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mom's shawl (that didn't match the dress By the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they take her BACK to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God.My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not just the, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was the, ""HE stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel"" and ""It's the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!"" moments. Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable. Disney movies aren't even this predictable.I'm gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn't buy it for $15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would've been better if only one thing would've happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. Oh, how lovely that would've been.Don't waste your time or money. Go see a GOOD movie."
Deception             ,antoniotierno,0,crime,2008,6,"The thing is that the plot takes too many turns, so many that the movie ties itself in knots and must resort to a lot of silliness to develop a finale and get out of the whole mess. The early moments are quite involving, showing the nerd-player friendship taking to something scary. Nevertheless, in spite of the good beginning, I figure the two leads have never the chemistry that would explain why they got drawn to one - another, so moments where the viewer would say ""OK, everything seems to work"" are very rare. The story gets then ridiculous in the end due to many plot twist that poop a film otherwise decent. There's also a cameo of Charlotte Ramplin"
Bolt             ,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,0,animation,2008,10,"""Wall-E"" was superb, I love and admire it/him, but ""Bolt"" does beat it! While the above mentioned (excellent!) movie did have some slow, insipid and predictable moments, in the spaceship setting - well, ""Bolt"" is coherent, self-consequent and true to itself from beginning to end! The script is based on a treasure of meanings: the world seen by the eye of a dog; the difference between fantasy and reality; the role of the audience in an entertainment project; and, first and foremost, the main idea: A DOG'S SUPER-POWER LAYS IN HIS FAITHFULNESS! Anyone who ever owned a dog knows how true (and sacred) a fact is this!Further, the same script is really intelligent - well structured and built up, with a solid dramaturgy and a captivating narration, right from the beginning. The starting premise, as expressed professionally, is: WHAT IF a dog, loyal with his life to his master, plays next to her the part of a super-dog in an action TV series? BUT WHAT IF, for him to act well, the trick is to make him believe that everything is true, and his super-powers are real? ...AND WHAT IF he gets lost by accident, and has to face the REAL WORLD (and his REAL SELF) to get back to his master? ...And this is how starts this truly initiatic trip, from New York City back to Hollywood, for the engaging Bolt, his acolyte Mittens (the stray cat who begins by being his sarcastic hostage, only to become his main supporter), and Rhino the hamster, his devoted fan. While the script continues in the same compact and fast-paced spirit, the direction adds up to it by being more than just adequate: it's expressive, enriching, imaginative, creative, bright. And what an admirable humor, what an elegant satire, what a perceiving look all over the American society, from the East Coast to California...! Of course, one should add that the graphics are superb, and the 3-D DOES WORK, friends and neighbors - it ceases at last to be just a cheap trick, and invests the story with style and perspective (not only at an optical level!) One last word, and the most important: yes, I'm an old bastard, harshly dragged along thousands of movies - but, when Bolt chose to die next to Penny, I wept."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,mossfoot,0,animation,2010,9,"I just saw this movie again, and stand by my original assessment of it. It's an underrated classic, with far more depth than most family movies. On the one hand it's more simplistic than, say, a Pixar film. It's more of a fairy tale like The Little Prince. And while I don't care for the character designs too much (though they do have an artistic charm to them), from a writing standpoint I would put Despereaux on par with the best Pixar films, maybe more so.Most of the main characters are seriously damaged, yet believably human (even the rodents). The way some characters fall from grace is more believable than anything Lucas came up with in Star Wars III.If it has a failing it's with some of the secondary characters, such as the Soup Maker's assistant (made up of vegetables) which just didn't really seem necessary.But the themes of anger, regret, sadness, depression, and the power of forgiveness makes this a movie I feel more children should be exposed to. It's a very much a children's movie, but deals very much with adult themes"
Twilight             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,1,misc,2008,4,"NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of ""so bad it's ALMOST good"". Yes, I just invented that category.The 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.Okay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.As far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good. 1,120"
Iron Man             ,z-mbe,0,action,2008,10,"As an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, I was excited but also very scared that this movie would flop.While Robert Downey is not the biggest name in Hollywood, he plays the part perfectly and I was greatly impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well.The humor works well for this film also. It's well-written and has a great cast.What impressed me the most was the CGI! They're breath-taking, but aren't distracting enough to let you miss the finer points of this movie.In conclusion, while not perfect, Iron Man lives up to its hype and my expectations as a reader of the comic. 6"
The House Bunny             ,rachnowen,1,comedy,2018,8,"This film was much better than I expected it to be, but to be fair I wasn't expecting too much, particularly when 'Happy Madison' appeared on the screen. However, it was really funny in places and even had thought-provoking sad moments too. It is your typical American concept of 'boys like bimbos' but this has a cute little twist, which I really liked. I just wish they would stop with the whole 'girls aren't sexy with glasses on' rubbish. Anyway, definitely worth a watch for silly, cheesy and sometimes very obvious laughs, just don't concentrate too much on Beverly D'Angelo's face, something strange has happened to it, and it it looks a little like melted plastic...such a shame. I gave it 8 stars because Emma Stone, as always is fantastic. She's believable in any role that she plays. Anna Faris is her usual funny goofy self, a part that she convincingly plays to a tee, and Kendra is in it. Everyone loves a bit of Kendr"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,judetripper,1,adventure,2008,8,"I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, Chloe was a lot more lovable than Wall-E and the story was more interesting. It was a fun adventure that the whole family will enjoy. The most heart warming character was an ex police dog who helped Chloe in her journey to find her way back home.There may be some frightening moments for the really small children but I'm sure everyone over six will be fine.I think the movie also had a message for our children that friendship is more important than pink leather booties and diamond necklaces.I only hope that the sequel is not too far away."
"Surfer, Dude             ",eduareke,0,comedy,2009,10,"There are a lot of mixed reviews about this movie. Some surfers rate it negatively because they think the movie is about surfing, and feel it does not portray the majority of surfers well, or feel offended by it.The movie is about ONE surfer, and the way he looks at life, not wanting to be part of the capitalist system others try to include him in.The plot is that. People trying to get the main character to do what they want, and him refusing to cooperate, brining upon him the hardships people with money can give you if you go against them.Nonetheless, the surfer in the movie stays true to his principles and doesn't give in.This is not a movie about surfing, or surfers, but about how the main character thinks surfing is all there is to life, and how he doesn't want to get involved into anyone's game, or be anyone's monkey.The film contains very nice shots, and a very nice soundtrack too, as well as some very funny moments. This is a movie to sit back and relax, and it might help you trivialize some things, like the state of your bank account."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,GibMart7,0,misc,2008,6,"I actually thought that the movie was pretty good. It's not as bad as the reviews that it's getting, just don't go in expecting to get an Oscar performance. The storyline was a little all over the place. Typical teen dance movie. BUT the dancing is amazing couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Robert Hoffman did a decent job, he really lays the charm in throughout the whole movie. The dance scenes make the entire movie. Ethnically, it is such a diverse cast of people, there is someone for everyone to identify with. The soundtrack is insanely good also. By the end of it you will be quoting lines and wanting to dance for sure. "
W.             ,doubleosix,0,misc,2008,7,"This is a very good movie, but not the classic it wants to be. It's funny and tragic, although not too informative if you've read a newspaper with any regularity over the last eight years. In short, there are no surprises.Josh Brolin gives an excellent performance as W., and the supporting cast is generally superb, although Jeffrey Wright, Richard Dreyfuss, and James Cromwell particularly stand out. Thandie Newton is hysterically funny as Condie Rice, but it's an SNL-type parody, not an emotionally honest performance.The film is obviously meticulously researched and carefully considered, which is why the sequences that are clearly either utter conjecture or merely political finger-pointing stand out by a mile.Bush -- whom I personally despise for his offensive combination of idiocy and self-righteousness -- is treated with fairness and sensitivity. The effort here is obviously to fashion him as a tragic hero; a man who genuinely wants to do good but simply doesn't grasp how hard that is, especially when surrounded by the likes of Karl Rove and Dick Cheney (who is, very specifically, the villain of the piece, as he is in life). And it generally works. I found myself feeling bad for the poor guy.However, while trying to make W. a sympathetic character, Stone pushes his theme -- ""It Was All To Prove Himself To Daddy"" way too far. He overplays his hand, including a mood-breaking dream sequence near the end. There simply has to be more to George W. Bush than that..... doesn't there? The film ultimately plays much, much better when Stone relies on actual transcripts and information gathered by experienced reporters, and those sequences, whether they are cabinet meetings, press conferences, or more personal moments, snap and zing. 2"
Nights in Rodanthe             ,aharmas,1,drama,2008,10,"Oh yes! Hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula, and when lightning hits, it's a rather wonderful feeling. Rarely Hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately, there seems to be more concern with hurrying up and getting the most rewards in a hurried manner, or there is the matter of too many cooks in the mix. Usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of his/her property, understand his material and is a good writer. Then, there is a little important part, often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision: a good actor.A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre, half-cooked try, and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie, but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type. We get very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are starved for them. Buried in the sexy humor of ""Sex in the City"" is the romantic, yet stormy relationship of Big and Carrie, and people flocked to ""Mamma Mia"" because it had some romance, skillfully played by Streep and Brossnam. It could have a silly musical, but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction. ""Nights"" offers us more of it, with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films, Ms. Diane Lane. Ever since her days as a child actor, we could appreciate how her talent, combined with her appreciative soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the story's protagonists. A few years back, she teamed up with Mr. Gere, giving us a tormented, romantic, and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her actions' consequences in ""Unfaithful"", work that should have garnered her at least an Academy Award. She is back, doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic prospects, and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner.Ms. Lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character undergoes. We can read frustrations, yearnings, desperation, anger, hope, loss, and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that Hollywood constantly push down our throats. Here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience.Ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film until the very end. Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love, much like a teenager does, and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible. Her eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical in the audience. She is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. In her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back. Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters.We admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it. Half their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate; however as much as anyone might make you think, it is the roles such as Lane's in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, given a personal imprint and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support, such as plays, and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen. Lane's character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us. She represents our dreams and emotions with much quality, class, and just the right amount of sentiment. It is quite a remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays.There are a few adjectives I could use to pay tribute to her work, but I can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer. Thank you, Ms. Lane."
Hancock             ,littlemartinarocena,0,action,2008,5,"A very good idea sadly undercooked. Rushed and thoughtless but with hints at what it might have been. All of that makes the experience a rather frustrating one. Will Smith is, without question, one of the best actors around and as Hancock, he uses every tiny opportunity to make the whole ludicrous thing almost palatable. When the camera is on him we feel the potential. There is a human being there in an impossible situation. Peter Berg, the director, lets his eye move around as if under the effect of a very powerful drug. Massive, nervous close ups in a story that tries to be missing the point at almost every corner. The actors are photographed harshly showing every skin imperfection even on the wonderful Charlize Theron. I wonder if that was on purpose. In fact that's what I wonder about the whole enterprise. Was it on purpose? Was the thoughtlessness part of the plan? If so, I don't get it."
Australia             ,isabelle1955,1,adventure,2008,NA,"I have no idea what to make of Australia. It can't possibly be a serious movie, right? It certainly starts as a camp comedy, then lurches into a clichéd action romance adventure, before descending into an attempt at World War Two melodrama and finishing with a dubious helping of Elgar over a rather uncomfortable attempt at serious social commentary. Elgar? I mean why? My dictionary defines a farrago as a confused mixture, a hodgepodge or medley. That sums up Australia perfectly, a farrago. It has no idea what it wants to be so it attempts to be everything to everyone and fails at almost all of it. You can only get away with this stuff if you are really clever and have a well honed sense of irony and your tongue kept firmly in your cheek. Australia is neither clever nor ironic enough, which is a pity, because I loved Moulin Rouge, but after watching The Man with One Noun, The Drover, send a band of wild horses galloping past the ranch house yet again for no discernible reason, I turned to my companion and said I thought Australia might be Bonanza meets Monty Python.I'm sorry if this sounds cruel, but when this much money is thrown at a movie and it turns out to be this inadequate, I actually feel quite miffed. Had it cost $10M, it might be excusable. At $100M plus, it isn't. I never, ever thought I'd find myself saying this, but Nicole Kidman is probably the best thing in this film, and the reason for that is because Kidman is actually quite good on the camp level (see her in Moulin Rouge or Practical Magic) <U+0096> I have a problem with her as a serious actress (The Hours, Margot at the Wedding.) Had director Baz Luhrmann stuck at the camp tongue in cheek genre, we'd all have been better off. Instead he gets serious and we get a script in which - especially in the second half - every other line of dialog is a grating cliché and competing story threads lead to superficial treatments of what could, taken individually, be quite interesting plots. I will say upfront that I don't blame any of the actors, I think they all did a reasonable job given the material. I get the feeling that Kidman, Jackman, Wenham et al all took a deep breath, tightened their belts, firmed their jaws and said ""OK, we've been paid for this, let's give it our best shot."" There's an enthusiastic ""let's put on the show in the barn"" feel to the acting. Or maybe it's me? The (multiple) stories: there's an aristocratic woman arriving in an alien hot land to take control of a ranch which was her husband's purchase (think Out of Africa but without Meryl Streep). There's a cattle drive across the Outback (again heavily borrowed from Out of Africa) and the criminally wasted diversion into the desert to try and find water, which could, if handled properly, have led to some quite interesting drama. The heroine can't have children (O of A again) and takes up with an attractively roguish man (Robert Redford / Hugh Jackman) while taking on responsibility for the Kikuyu/Aboriginals who inhabit her land because unlike 99.99% of the other white colonizers, she has a conscience - surprise surprise. There are aerial shots of the Australian Outback <U+0096> compare to the aerial shots of the Rift Valley in O of A - there's the pantomime villain Neil Fletcher played by David Wenham (apparently picking up where he left off in The Proposition playing an identical character, called Eden Fletcher <U+0096> is there some significance to the name that a non Australian doesn't get?) then we lurch into the bombing of Darwin and the rescue of the lost children. If there are movie awards for plagiarism, Australia is in the running. It's an understatement to say it lacks originality.It's also far, far too long, falling into a genre I'm beginning to call the 'Depends' movie, after the adult diapers required to sit through it - especially necessary when you realize that the only really acceptable way to watch Australia is after several drinks. Combine this with CGI which barely attempts to blend into the live action, an almost unbearably cute kid (Brandon Walters is heart melting) plus a cast which features every Australian actor who's graduated drama school since WW2, and what exactly is this movie supposed to be? Even as an advert for the Aussie tourist industry I doubt it works as well as The Proposition, which had better shots of dramatic Outback scenery. And how many visitors go to the Northern Territories to watch cattle droves? If Luhrmann really did edit this down from many more hours of film, then possibly he can re-issue a director's cut which works better. I see it working as a musical, along the lines of Moulin Rouge. The corn is certainly as high as a kangaroo's eye.I went with a (female) friend who is a Hugh Jackman fan and I will, if cornered, admit to being a closet David Wenham groupie, so we were well primed to enjoy this, two girlies on a Friday night out - probably the target audience. But even Jackman taking his shirt off couldn't save it (and believe me, I've seen other movies where a Jackman shirt removal certainly did save the day.) I have no idea how much they paid David Wenham to make this, but it probably wasn't enough. It's not as bad as their other foray together, Van Helsing, but that's not saying much. And OK, the costumes were pretty. But the rest? Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear<U+0085> 1"
I Sell the Dead             ,jseger9000,,misc,2010,3,"Great cast, great idea and stylish.... but it was missing something. It was neat to look at, but I never really connected to it.There were a whole lot of good ideas, but not enough was done with them. The movie would have been better if it were longer to expand on the ideas or more focused. Most of Arthur's apprenticeship could have been cut for instance.The horror wasn't particularly scary and the humor snicker worthy at best. Combined with the slow pacing, it's just too many strikes against the movie. It's a shame, because this movie has the cast and ingredients to be a genuine cult classic."
Changeling             ,jdesando,1,misc,2008,NA,"Christine Collins: ""The boy they brought back is not my son.""ClintEastwood s knows a good story, and he knows how to tell it on film. Not everything he does is as powerful as his depiction of a dynamic female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, for which Hilary Swank won a best actress Oscar among four for the film. In Changeling he presents another strong woman, Christine Collins, played by the notable Angelina Jolie. Because she is directed to weep at almost every turn and regularly underplay her grit, Jolie won't win accolades, nor will Eastwood rack up the nominations as he frequently does in Oscar season. But his adaptation of the historic Wineville Chicken Murders chills with his perceptions about the capriciousness of crime and the determination of those who choose to fight it.In a Prohibition-era 1928, Collins gets word that the Los Angeles Police Department is returning her kidnapped eight-year old son. When she sees him at the station, a finely directed sequence showing the forces of motherhood and politics clash, she knows it is not her child. LAPD, needing the good publicity, forces her to take the boy overnight with the logic that she is merely in shock. The rest of this overly long thriller carefully traces the discoveries leading to resolutions and disappointments. Along the way, police corruption is exposed, mental institution incarceration of women is laid bare, and grisly serial murdering is slowly detailed.Yet in this discursive narrative, Eastwood indulges himself beyond Jolie's annoying crying by gratuitously laboring over the details of an execution. The stark San Quentin setting is ghastly and the villain worthy except for the film's obvious criticism of false mental institution lockup, ironic here because this murderer is clearly deranged enough to be determined unfit for trial.As in every Eastwood production, the values are first-rate, in this case period costuming and vehicles (those Model T's and trolley cars are beautiful). As in Mystic River, Eastwood knows how to splice family and community together in the struggle against organized crime, from street violence to public service malpractice. The activist preacher Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich) helps bring the worlds together in his radio broadcasts, Malkovich for once playing good well. Eastwood continues to be the director of choice for depicting crimes and heartaches that strike the common citizen at will. We all should be as productive in our later years. May he extend well beyond his golf-playing days and into our future. 1"
Slumdog Millionaire             ,JABKool,0,drama,2008,10,"I just saw this at the Savannah Film Festival (on Friday October 31st, 2008), held by the Savannah College Of Art and Design (SCAD) and as soon as the credits started rolling for this movie the first word that came out of my mouth was ""WOW!!!"" This movie is easily one of the best of 2008, I honestly don't know how the people have given this movie a average rating of 7 here on IMDb. This movie is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything he ever loved taken away from him, only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope. It is preformed and put together in such a way that it forgets and bypasses every love story cliché. The movie starts out a little confusing but is very quickly sorted out and understood. Danny Boyle has made a film that inspires and encourages people of all ages.To summarize the deep and perfectly delivered message of this movie; you don't have to be a genius to know the answers in life, sometimes life is just written(whether you call it fate or destiny). This movie I'm sure will find its place amongst the great love movie's like ""The Princess Bride"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Titanic"". Some people I know have problems over the fact that this movie takes place in India, but if you just for one moment let go of that and watch this movie you will instantly find out just how amazing this movie is.Even though I am writing this review now in November, I hope that you will read this review when the film comes out officially in January and go out and see it. BECAUSE WHETHER YOU GO INTO THAT THEATER ALONE; WITHOUT A GIRLFRIEND OR NOT, YOU WILL WALK OUT OF THAT THEATER INSPIRED, ENCOURAGED, HOPEFUL, BUT MOST OF ALL IN LOVE WITH THIS FILM.For my closing statement I need to mention that recently this film got an undeserving ""R"" rating, but this is one movie you should not be ashamed to have your parents take you to see. And is the perfect movie to take a loved one to. 4"
What Happens in Vegas             ,brad_317,1,comedy,2008,6,"All you have to do is watch the trailer for this movie and you know generally how it's going to pan out. And even while watching it, it's pretty predictable.However, in saying that, it certainly had its moments. Ashton Kutcher plays the usual role, Cameron Diaz looks good and acts bad as always, Rob Corddry is hilarious in a secondary role as Kutcher's bumbling lawyer friend and the very attractive Lake Bell provides some more wit as Diaz best friend.Overall, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed the majority of it (with the exception of a few, forced sappy moments).Worth my money? Yes, cause it was cheap night and only cost me $4.20! Worth your $10? Not really. Just rent it when it comes out. "
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,marcveda,0,misc,2011,9,"A beautiful film; exquisite cinematography, locations and costumes. The acting is excellent throughout and the whole film has a fantastic soundtrack and audio mix.Il Divo is a surreal take on the real-life events of late twentieth- century Italian politics, centred on the life of long-serving politician Giulio Andreotti. For non-Italians and those unfamiliar with the subject matter, it might be best to watch the film twice and to read up on the facts of the story in between.Possibly, one of the most beautiful political thrillers ever made; dark, haunting, majestic and wonderfully bizarr"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,BeneCumb,0,crime,2013,NA,"Small distant communities have always local secrets not to be revealed to outsiders, but sometimes small hidden minor matters develop into big illegal acts... Such things we can follow in Frygtelig lykkelig where an ""exiled"" policeman wades into a family affair in a township in South- Jutland. He is not easily accepted by locals - although he constantly tries - and the price of acceptance comes to be high. The ending scenes are somewhat logical, although they are hard to consider likely in the Danish society where crime ties are not routine. However, tensions and run of events are skilfully depicted by wonderful directing and camera-work.As for the cast, then Jakob Cedergren is a decent actor, but he is still neither e.g. Mads Mikkelsen or Ulrich Thomsen... And in scenes together with Kim Bodnia or Lars Brygmann, Cedergren's presence is less perceived. The leading female, Lene Maria Christensen was also just above average. Nevetheless, the film in question is a nicely twisted crime film, a good example of Danish filmograph"
Stop-Loss             ,Michael_Elliott,0,drama,2008,NA,"Stop-Loss (2008) **** (out of 4) Hard hitting, Anti-Iraq film has Ryan Phillippe playing a U.S. soldier who leaves his final mission in Iraq but soon learns he's been stop-lossed, which means the government can break your original contract and send you back to Iraq. Phillippe refuses to go back so he goes AWOL and hits the road with his best friend's girl (Abbie Cornish) while trying to figure out what to do. Over the past few years there have been countless films protesting the Iraq war and all of them have been fair (Lions for Lambs) to really poor (Redacted) but this one here is clearly the best of the bunch but it's also one of the best war movies out there and clearly one of the best of 2008. The movie has a strong stance against the war but it's certainly Pro-Soldier and the film bleeds with love for the young men putting their lives on the line each day. The film opens with a scene in Iraq where the soldiers are working a checkpoint when a group of thugs show up with guns a soon a big battle breaks out and leads to tragedy. I really enjoyed what director Peirce did here by instead of focusing on the violence she clearly wants the viewer to see that these are kids doing this fighting. She makes it clear to us that it's kids doing the shooting and being shot at, which is something people and the media seems to forget. The Anti-Iraq stuff is handled very well and never becomes too preachy unlike many other recent films. I think the film's one problem is that it really should have ran at least an hour longer because the movie not only looks at Phillippe's situation but also two of his friends who are dealing with their own battles on returning home. The film is a lot like The Deer Hunter, a film that took three hours to tell its story, and I think that long running time would have worked well here. The two friends play a major part in the story and an emotional one so I think their stories could have been pushed out a bit further. The performances in the film are all rather remarkable and this is certainly the greatest work I've seen from Phillippe. I don't want to ruin anything but he has to go through all sorts of mental pain in the film and he pulls this off wonderfully well. I think Phillippe has always been a good actor but this film here pushes him to a great one. He really does give a strong, raw and highly emotional performance, which is the heart of the film. Cornish is also very good in her role as is Channing Tatum as the best friend. No matter where you stand on the actual war, that shouldn't keep you away from this film, which is quite original in how it tells its story and most importantly it does pay tribute to these kids who lost their lives on the battle field. This is a very strong and highly emotional film that pushes all the right buttons and really delivers."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,uclacampusevents,1,comedy,2008,10,"The movie is absolutely hilarious. I loved it. It met and exceeded by (very high) expectations. Jason Segall proved he can hold down a leading role and an extremely funny script. Part of the reason this movie is so funny are the ""funny 'cause it's true"" aspects of Peter's method of dealing with his breakup. Although the honeymooner's plot was a little unnecessary, everything else was great. All the characters were really funny and the dialogue and situations were hilarious. Definitely worth paying for to see in the theaters and watching it with everyone else around you busting out laughing as well is a worthy experience too. "
Shutter             ,oktobreana,0,horror,2008,6,"*SPOILER ALERT* It was not bad, had some good elements, but this whole Asian horror scenario is getting kind of old. Same look, same style, etc. I think the writers overseas are better but the production in America is better. More than frightening me, it left me a little sad. You feel sorry for the character, you don't particularly fear her. And his wife's reaction to the secret photos was pretty extreme...you would certainly be alarmed and unnerved, but somehow I don't think you'd have such a visceral reaction. They made it seem like someone had torn off her face or something.I did like knowing why the Japanese nurse kept weighing him though...pretty clever!"
College Road Trip             ,robertallenandersonjr,1,adventure,2008,8,College Road Trip was a pretty funny movie. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it was funny enough. It was well made. In the beginning I thought it was going to be bad the way the first half started but then it got really good. There were also a ton of great messages in this movie. Im not a big fan of Raven Symone but she actually did a pretty good job for her first big movie hit. I find her very annoying and it seems like she never knows when to shut up. I thought that this was a very different movie for Martin Lawrence. Although it was a different type of movie for him he nailed the part. A bad thing about this movie was that it seemed like it copied of of a couple movies in several scenes. One of the movies were Penelope. The direction in this movie was fairly good. The message was about being able to let your kids grow up and having trust in them. This movie does show that life does go by really fast. That fact is true about life going by way to fast. So in that case you should spend more time with your kids and live life to the fullest. I didn't like Martin Lawrences wife in the movie that much. I thought that she did a good job despite me not liking her. They also found a mother that looked a little bit like Raven Symone which was smart. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when the father and daughter went sky diving. It goes to show you that a father can get along with his daughter and have deep conversations. The person I saw this movie with teared a little bit at the end. So I guess it was like a little bit of a tear jerker to some people and maybe you to. This is a perfect movie for you to see to if you are going to college soon. It was more of a little kids type of movie but also the whole family can enjoy it to. It really gives you a good outlook of what college is going to be like. The story was also very cute. Overall this movie was pretty good and a very cute family movie.
Frost/Nixon             ,motta80-2,0,misc,2008,9,"It is a testament to Peter Morgan's humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard's ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling ""what will happen"" drama (as he did with Apollo 13) that Frost/Nixon succeeds as a film.This is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof, Closer, The Producers, have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films, many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn't had the chance, but they weren't necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan's work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious, he has not tried to enforce his already successful stage-play onto a film director <U+0096> he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference <U+0096> the pacing is changed, the power achieved in different ways.For this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film <U+0096> one long two-hander scene after another, duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings, but Howard knows when we need quick cuts, when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a post-scene reaction, and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.For some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can't escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the head-to-head scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary, but it sadly means that the supporting players, so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half, fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb, as they were on stage, and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role <U+0096> instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure, he has the most to do but he is completely in this role, he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.I thoroughly recommend this film. 1"
The Objective             ,JackyBryant,,horror,2008,9,"This movie is an amazing blend of science fiction, horror, and thrills.A CIA agent recruits a couple grunt soldiers to track down a religious leader in Afghanistan to interview him.But the soldiers soon find out that this is just a deception to lure them deep into a remote region of Afghanistan. What follows is a thrilling, scary, and exciting film that almost never lets up until the ending.The writing is great, there are no over the top lines and long philosophical battles between characters, this is a movie about soldiers and they speak and act accordingly. The acting is fantastic, characters seems genuinely scared and nervous whenever appropriate. And the plot is a fantastic twist on the usual 'small company' war story movie as it adds elements of supernatural horror and psychological terror as the main antagonists instead of rival soldiers.The cons are the slightly low budget special effects at some points, instead of showing poorly done CGI, I would have opted for the 'less is more' approach and focused on characters reactions to the supernatural phenomenon instead. The ending was a bit disappointing as well as there is very little concrete resolution but with some creative assuming and inference it is relatively obvious as to what happens to each individual character.If you like horror or thriller movies or just want to see a fresh idea then absolutely give this movie a chance. It's a bit nerve wracking if you're watching it in the dark and definitely not for children. Adults however, especially those into film, this deserves at least rental. "
Julia             ,pc95,1,crime,2011,5,"""Julia"" starring Tilda Swinton has an excellent first 1/4 going for it. It was on par with Leaving Las Vegas which surely it draws some parallels to until (big spoiler) the whole kidnapping fiasco. For me at this point the film dives into main-stream shtick ceasing to carry the careful nuances of a character development into unfortunately a gimmicky, sometimes, violent, but clichéd chase film. At this point the movie pretty much lost me full force. There may be an original story director Erick Zonca is following, but as the director, was hoping he elected to keep the title character more static in an introspective investigation rather than a moving and jarring rush and hullabaloo. By the end of the movie, the thing has become a mess a distant whimper of how interesting it started out a"
Righteous Kill             ,joebloggscity,0,crime,2008,4,"Surely with a movie that stars both Al Pacino & Robert de Niro, you just can't go wrong? Both are legends of the big screen, and both are lauded for making legendary roles their own.Yet sadly with ""Righteous Kill"" it just doesn't pay off. It's a thriller around a serial killer of various nefarious characters (pimps, drug dealers etc). The film begins with a confession by de Niro (a cop) that he is the killer, and we are led on a journey as he and his partner (Pacino) fight off another pair of cops who are suspicious that the trail leads to de Niro.Having starred together in Heat, you'd expect some high standards, but for some reason the chemistry here just doesn't work and at points you think they really aren't interested. Fellow actors aren't too strong either, and much of the action seems to be just going with the flow. The storyline is interesting enough (with a good finale) but never seems to grip you through much of the film.Overall, its a disappointment and you expect better from a film that has de Niro & Pacino together in it."
The Incredible Hulk             ,hoove1970,0,action,2008,8,"I went into this completely blind. I wanted a pure 'experience' I saw ONE trailer prior to this screening and closed my eyes while humming. I had no idea if this was a second in the series or a re-make.I was pleasantly surprised at the (obvious)complete makeover of our big green friend, and this was a (P.R.)change for him no doubt... this delightful romp will bring him right into the ""good guy fold"" so to speak, within the umbrella of the, ""Avengers"" Franchise that is now an inevitability.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, Lots of time on character development, and the intricacies that make you really care for a plot and its characters. I thought the acting was very well done although I found Liv Tyler to be the 'Weak Link'. Not sure she 'sold' her part that well or maybe it was just typecasting for that ""Armageddon"" girl. The CGI was top shelf. There were no seriously 'over done' moments of ,""awww Come on"" uttered in the theater. In this packed theater there were many ovations for the cameo's and the ,""Bad guy gets it"" scenes, and even for the thrilling last minute of the movie. So where was Samuel L. Jackson?Please enjoy this more Comic like and more faithful version of THE HULK!*** PARENTS*** Go see it! Please do not bring kids under 5 yrs old! it is very realistic and violent.

Saw V             ,Bloomer,0,crime,2008,6,"I watched Saw V with a good opening night crowd here in Sydney. I've enjoyed all of the Saw films, predictably liking some episodes a lot more than others, and Saw V is, again, very watchable, with some intense moments and no shortage of grisliness. But I'd still say it's the weakest entry in the series to date. The trouble is that the main narrative addition for this episode, which has to sustain half the running time, turns out to be a dramatically weak one. I don't think a Saw film ever previously failed to create excitement or new meaning via one of its big twisty revelations, but Saw V's add next to nothing. The knowledge gained doesn't force any re-evaluation of the past events it concerns; you just see and know a bit more about them, and to no great effect, except for the fact that Tobin Bell's performance is always compelling, maybe even more so when he's talking to people who aren't stuck in Jigsaw's deathtraps.The Saw films have demonstrated an unfeasibly high success rate over time in terms of pulling off twist after twist and having them nearly all hit home. With this track record, it seems inevitable that there'd be a significant stumble at some point. They've never been bulletproof films (and thrillers are the genre that are hardest to bulletproof), but I'd say Saw V is definitely the stumble. In spite of this, it still keeps in enough with the series in general for me to be ready for Saw VI in 2009 - which I hope will be better work. "
Yes Man             ,MasterDebator5,0,comedy,2009,7,"Yes ManDirected by Peyton Reed. Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.In the late '90s, Jim Carrey decided he'd had enough of playing the silly goofball and started on a path to more serious films like ""The Truman Show."" Ten years later, he's had his share of hits, but for the most part, his comedic efforts have fallen flat. Excusing 2003's fairly enjoyable ""Bruce Almighty"", Carrey hasn't had much recent success with the genre that he once dominated (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", anyone?).In ""Yes Man"", the skilled physical comedian has dusted off the cobwebs and is back in good form. Carrey really seems to be enjoying himself, putting on his best game face and immersing himself in the sight gags and slapstick madness that were so commonplace in his earlier films. He hasn't lost his touch or his talent at making people laugh, and he makes sure that the audience knows it.Truthfully, the plot to ""Yes Man"" is irrelevant. Carl Allen (Carrey), a man afraid of living life, challenges himself to say 'yes' to everything for an entire year. Hilarity ensues and in the end, everyone learns a lesson. It's nothing more than a vehicle to showcase Carrey's ability. But really, which one of his comedies isn't? There are no unexpected twists or surprise endings, just Jim Carrey doing what Jim Carrey does best. Everything else is secondary.The film is rounded out rather nicely by a few of its supporting players. Zooey Deschanel is a cute and bubbly romantic interest who even adds a bit of mayhem to the proceedings, instead of being relegated to straight-man status. ""Flight of the Conchords'"" Rhys Darby shines as Carl's Harry Potter-obsessed co-worker. However, some of the cast feels extraneous. Bradley Cooper and ""That '70s Show's"" Danny Masterson are given little to do, and contribute little as a result. The missed opportunities are irksome, but will do little to affect one's enjoyment of the film.""Yes Man"" is a fun time waiting to be had for those who know what to expect. The movie is generally funny throughout, but not clever or inventive enough to justify a second look. It's the kind of entertainment that leaves you chuckling, but won't be remembered long after viewing. The biggest thing going for the film is that it has re-energized Jim Carrey. He's an absolute joy to watch; one only wishes that ""Yes Man"" could keep up with him.Final Grade: C+"

Lakeview Terrace             ,zardoz-13,0,crime,2008,1,"Samuel L. Jackson doesn't know how to give a bad performance, but his choice of movies raises some questions. ""Wicker Man"" director Neil LeBute's suburban crime thriller ""Lakeview Terrace"" qualifies as a predictable, PG-rated melodrama that draws its inspiration from a real-life case of racism where an African-American cop harassed interracial couples in Los Angeles. This disposable,depressing, one-dimensional character study in villainy casts Jackson as a 28-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department who doesn't cotton to his new next door neighbors, a twentysomething interracial couple without a clue. For the record, ""Hancock"" star Will Smith sank some of his dough into this heavy-handed hokum.Chris (Patrick Wilson of ""Hard Candy"") and Lisa Mattson (Kerry Washington of ""Ray"") have just bought their first house. Chris manages a grocery store and Lisa sits around the house drawing pictures when she isn't forgetting to take her birth control pills. She wants a child to mellow out her racist father Harold Perreau (Ron Glass of ""Barney Miller"") who didn't approve of her daughter's decision to marry a white bread yuppie. Movies have come a long way since the 1967 classic ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" where Sidney Poitier married a white girl. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac appeared in the abysmal remake ""Guess Who"" that reversed everything so that white guy Kutcher could wed black girl Zoe Saldana. Everybody got along in these classic as well as less-than-classic movies. No sooner have Chris and Lisa moved in than they aggravate single-parent cop Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction"") who doesn't take kindly to their liberal-minded antics.Abel raises teenager daughter Celia (Regine Nehy of ""Pride"") and young son Marcus (TV actor Jasihon Fisher) without the benefit of a mother. Abel reveals later to Chris that his wife died in a traffic accident under suspicious circumstances that he hasn't quite reconciled himself to three years later. Abel rules his kids like a tyrant. Not only does he correct Celia's slang-ridden grammar at the breakfast table but he also reprimands her for wearing her iPod every waking moment. Similarly, he doesn't cut Marcus any slack. Not surprisingly, both Celia and Marcus are overjoyed when they get a break from dad to spend time with a relative. Meanwhile, Abel explains to his green, Hispanic partner Javier Villareal (Jay Hernandez of the ""Hostel"" horror flicks) that he moved his family out of the troubled ghettos where he grew up so that they would have a better life. Abel keeps a tight lid on his patrol area, just as most cops in crime movies do, playing criminals off against other to maintain law and order. Abel has an obese white drug dealer Clarence (Keith Loneker of ""Leatherheads"") under his thumb and protects Clarence because he serves as an informant.Abel and the Mattson's get off on the wrong foot. Abel welcomes Chris by pulling a fake carjacking while our protagonist sits in his parked car in his own driveway listening to hip-hop music. Afterward, Abel advises Chris that no matter how loud or how long he plays hip-hop it will never made him black. Chris smokes secretly in his car because Lisa won't let him smoke in their house. He aggravates things when he thumps his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. Abel's blinding security home lights keep the Mattsons from sleeping since they don't have curtains. Chris talks to Abel but gets nowhere. Things really derail because the Mattson's have a backyard swimming pool that Celia and Marcus would die to swim in but Abel doesn't want them hobnobbing with the neighbors. Anyway, the Abel's kids play peeping toms one evening when Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Abel objects to this behavior and the incidents intensify. Our heroes awaken to their car alarm, rush down to their garage, and discover the tires on their sedan have been slashed. Abel discusses the situation with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputies who responded to the Mattson's call and a Sheriff's Deputy remarks that they are lucky because they live next door to a cop.""Lakeview Terrace"" shares a lot in common with the paranoid Michael Keaton thriller ""Pacific Heights."" No matter what our heroes do, Abel beats them to the punch, until his own people<U+0097>LAPD Internal Affairs<U+0097>give him the third degree for roughing up a young African-American male, Damon Richards (Jada Pinkett Smith's younger brother Caleeb Pinkett of ""Charmed""), who tried to blast Abel with a pump action shotgun during a domestic disturbance at an apartment complex. Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Morgada (Eva La Rue of CBS-TV's ""C.S.I. Miami"") and her colleague warn Abel that they are watching him.Jackson smolders with rage in this combustible movie because he doesn't approve of a white guy playing house with a black girl. Jackson's performance is about the only thing worth watching because his co-stars barely make an impression as a sympathetic couple that have to contend with his cruel shenanigans. Indeed, the sympathetic couple are pretty boring. Since the bad cop doesn't have a moral leg to stand on, it is just a matter of time until he makes his fatal mistake. In other words, the short-sighted David Loughery and Howard Korder's screenplay boasts few surprises. Loughery's less-than-impressive writing credits include ""Money Train"" and ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,"" while Howard Korder has penned the TV movie ""Stealing Sinatra"" and ""The Passion of Ayn Rand."" None of their screenplays have amounted to much so it's no surprise that ""Lakeview Terrace"" is such a woofer. Basically, neither director Neil LeBute nor his scenarists have brought a shred of imagination to a potentially explosive but superficial saga. If you've seen the trailer for ""Lakeview Terrace,"" you've seen more than enough to know that this objectionable opus is worth neither your time nor your money."
Milk             ,calebcox,0,misc,2008,10,"I watched this film last night and it had me in tears. If you don't know the story of Harvey Milk, then you really should. I had never heard of him until this film and I don't know why I hadn't. I'm not gay and feel quite uncomfortable watching other guys kissing, but have nothing against homosexuality. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all throughout this film and it really left me feeling very sympathetic for the gay community, and anyone who is persecuted for being different. Sean Penn delivers the most outstanding performance i have seen him deliver in ages, it should definitely warrant an Oscar! James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirch and Diego Luna also showing their brilliance. All the actors were incredible and to think that none of them (that i know of) are actually gay. It must take some serious ability to pull that one off so believably. Maybe I just don't have a gaydar and can't see it, so could someone who is gay let me know what he thought of their performance. Anyway, there is a lot to learn from this film, it shocks me to think this happened only a generation ago and we were all such an unaccepting bunch of idiots back then. However, it tells the entire story from an unbiased view. All the homophobes and 'bad guys' aren't just displayed as bad people, but always come across as being human, albeit ignorant, you can't blame someone for their ignorance. Gus Van Sant's direction as usual was fantastic, some very innovative and clever shots, and by using an old school camera through many parts of the film, could blend real historical footage and modern film seamlessly. One of the best films I have seen all year! I hope it does well and wins multiple awards, it definitely deserves it! Enjoy this film, it has really touched me."
Flash of Genius             ,dancemacabre,0,misc,2009,9,"I started to watch this movie after a hit Seven Pound, with a Will Smith in main role. That movie was so bored and predictable for me and I decided to watch Flash Of Genius with Greg Kinnear. I haven't know anything about this movie and in few minutes I've been noticed that this work is ten times better than the popular Seven Pounds. FOG has only 1,500 votes on IMDb and SP has a 35 000 votes. OMG, Flash Of genius is so damn underrated movie. It isn't bored, it very good directed and interesting and almost better than similar movie A Beautiful Mind. But in this movie role of Greg Kinnear isn't that genius as Russel Crowe role but he isn't also crazy and schizophrenic as Crowe role. FOG has no pathetic music and in some scenes is heart touching and enjoyable and I must say Greg Kinnear is very god actor in this role - he perfectly fit into family man who has invented a car viper, but soon Ford Company stole his invent. Greg is so depressed by that act so his starting to work on court trial. I was so happy he get lawsuit on his side and get a lots of money for his family. What can I say more? This movie is very good in my opinion and I have no complaint to it. For those who don't know, this movie is a based on actual events in the 1940's. I give it a 9/10 because it deserves fully. Don't miss this, you won't regret it for sur"
I Sell the Dead             ,agitpop,,misc,2010,3,"I am a usually a very generous voter on IMDb and don't bother commenting on movies I did not like, but this was just lame. I actually turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it, to watch ""This Is It"" (because my gf wanted to... I just chose the lesser of two evils).If you want to watch this movie: picture this film as a collection of worse-than-average ""horror""-stories, like ""scary short-stories"" that you find in an issue of ""Reader's Digest"" in the waiting room of your dentist's.I did not expect anything particular terrifying or funny, I am not the ""I want to see blood!""-type of person, but this ""movie"" is neither ""horror"" nor ""comedy"" nor entertaining in any other way.It's probably more scary/funny and entertaining to look at the movie-poster of ""You've Got Mail"" for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea.Conclusion: a ""horror-comedy"" for people between 4 and 7"
Pathology             ,ezaluvzya,1,crime,2008,1,"I detested this film so much that I've registered as an IMDb user, simply to write this review! What a load of rubbish! It's a shame that the actors went to so much trouble (they all turn in strong performances) because with such a ridiculous, incomprehensible mess of a script, they didn't stand a chance. The characters lack any substance or motivation. Gratuitous sex scenes are simply inserted for the fun of it, with no bearing on the narrative whatsoever. The viewer has no sympathy, empathy or even interest in the useless protagonist Dr Grey, and the end leaves you with a great big sense of ""Okay.. So what?"" The premise sounded terrific, but the execution was a mess. This is no exploration of the dark realms of the human psyche.. It's an implausible load of gory crap. Avoid at all costs."
The Escapist             ,JenEvans1,,crime,2009,10,"This has to be one of the best films I have ever seen! And the surprising thing is, it is not one that I would have wanted to see normally.I tend to like either science fiction, romance, comedies, etc and hardly ever watch prison escape or crime films. I think they're more of a 'man' thing? Anyway, my husband wanted to see this one so I thought I'd show willing, but honestly, I've got to admit, it just blew me away. It was fantastic! I won't go into the plot, suffice to say that it was gripping enough so that after the first few minutes I was totally engrossed. The acting was superb, the characters so vivid and couldn't wait to see how it would all end.And I wasn't disappointed! I honestly never saw that twist at the end coming, I was genuinely shocked. What a great film! If you haven't seen it you absolutely must!"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,CKDexter-4,1,misc,2008,7,"The movie of Edel and Eichinger is fine when it comes to sets and costumes. It seems to catch the mood of the late Sixties and Seventies very well. Also the lead actors Bleibtreu, Wokalek and Gedeck have delivered outstanding performances. Too bad, that they don't get a chance to really explore their characters: Too much else is going on in this movie, that completely loses its focus during the last hour. The closer we get to the end, the more it resembles a documentary with a few scenes of play cut in now and then.The viewer is presented with a lot of facts - and violence - but the movie fails in decoding the often cited ""myth"" of the RAF. For example, I've always wondered, whether Baader was just a criminal or really politically motivated. Well, in the first half of the movie, Baader is portrayed as an outlaw, who enjoys provocation and fast cars. Later he delivers sophisticated political statements. A good movie should at least try to explain this development. DER BAADER MEINHOF KOMPLEX doesn't."
Ghost Town             ,andythedarkone,0,misc,2008,3,"I have never fell asleep during a film in the cinema, until i went to see this film, i was fully rested, and drinking coffee! The reason why I saw this film was the lesser of two evils, it was either this or High school musical 3!!! The basic plot for this film is a good idea, original as well, unfortunately the finished result is often boring, pretty grinding, and left you asking some questions. Why would a man whom is not a people person move to one of the most heavily populated cities on earth? Why would a dead man need a mobile phone? How come in the scenes where the main character is walking though the streets talking to dead people / ghost, nobody living whom walks past wondering who is this madman? Does the main character actually succeed?? The film ends pretty badly, and not in a cliffhanger sort of way!This films main problem is Ricky gervais, his acting is not brilliant, admittedly some of the jokes in the film are funny, some of the items discuss are relevant to modern living, but his main fault is the style of humour he uses, which is still 'the office' based, works well for half an hour, doesn't work for a film lasting nearly two hours.This is a film I won't be renting or buying on DVD."
The Burning Plain             ,MaxBorg89,1,misc,2008,8,"Following his artistic divorce from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, writer Guillermo Arriaga, whose Tarantino-inspired interlocked storytelling also formed the basis of Tommy Lee Jones' magnificent The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, makes his debut as director with The Burning Plain, another recount of connected fates.Whereas his previous screenplays were male-driven, The Burning Plain stands out for having three women at the center of things: Sylvia (Charlize Theron) is a restaurant owner who, despite what appears to be a relationship with one of her employees (John Corbett), is deeply unsatisfied and spends all of her free time smoking cigarettes and sleeping with other men; Gina (Kim Basinger) is your typical housewife, except she's survived breast cancer and is cheating on her husband (Brett Cullen) with a Mexican man named Nick (Joaquim de Almeida); Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence), Gina's daughter, is probably the most messed up of the three, especially after she starts dating Nick's son Santiago. And finally, remaining on the female front, there's also a little girl, Maria, who travels from Mexico to the United States with a family friend to find her long lost mother.As always with Arriaga, these stories are linked by a tragic event: in Amores Perros and 21 Grams it was a car crash, while in Babel it was a gunshot wound. This time, the connection, though not that obvious, is a burning trailer seen in the first scene of the film. The twist is that the writer/director has gotten more ambitious in telling yet another human tragedy: instead of having a geographic separation between the three plot strands, like he did in Babel, he goes for the most classic of choices, namely time shifts, only those aren't proper flashbacks, and therefore, as one can expect, it takes a while before all the pieces fit together. By choosing this narrative solution Arriaga is trying to tell us he can do just as fine a job as his former collaborator Inarritu behind the camera, but it's hardly a surprise to find out he doesn't always succeed: being a first-time director, he prefers to keep things safe with a classic style rather than adapting some of Inarritu's tricks (most notably the chromatic link between character and mood) to his own vision. And it must be said that a more experienced filmmaker would have known how to avoid the emotional flatness that comes from the few scenes (two or three at the most) where Arriaga panders to the genre's most idiotic clichés (three words: hospital, coma, confession).Overall, however, the narrative is very solid, and having learned a valuable lesson from his past creative partners Arriaga has set up a cast that doesn't really include any big names (Theron notwithstanding) but delivers a string of compelling performances: the most touching turns come from Basinger, always good when playing vulnerable, damaged women, and de Almeida, whose tenderness comes off as a real surprise given his fame (in the US at least) as rough crime lords in Desperado and the third season of 24. Lawrence pulls off her tricky role with a maturity that justifies the Mastroianni Award (i.e. Most Promising Newcomer) she won at the Venice Film Festival. Cullen, Corbett and Danny Pino impress despite the limited screen time at their disposal, and Theron, still partially recovering from the Aeon Flux fiasco, portrays Sylvia with the kind of understated intensity that characterizes her best work.Verdict: if you were unmoved by Inarritu's films, this is not for you. Otherwise, give it a try: it's not as mesmerizing as 21 Grams, but in its best moments it comes close enough."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,RJBurke1942,0,crime,2014,NA,"Terribly Happy - a purposely reflexive and ironic title - begins by drawing the viewer into the world of Robert (Jacob Cedergren), the young constable who has been transferred to a tiny town in a remote part of Denmark. He is guilty of ... something. ""So - you snapped, eh!"" remarks his superior officer. Hence Robert's transfer is implicitly a punishment of sorts....The town - situated on a bleak, boggy, barren plain - is peopled with a community who quickly show Robert he must adjust to their way of handling troublesome situations: help for a local domestic violence plight of a woman, Ingelise (Lene Christensen), in fear of her husband, Jorgen (Kim Bodnia) and who doubles as the town bully; Robert slaps a young shoplifter to the ground at the urging of the shopkeeper, instead of charging the young offender; he is forced to accept the cat left behind by the previous constable who apparently disappeared - as did the owner of the bicycle shop where Robert goes to have his flat tire repaired. Moreover, washed clothes must hung out only in a certain way.Such confusion just gets worse when the apparently beaten wife seems to want an affair with Robert. He tries to resist, but an unaccountable drive spurs him on to an illicit relationship. Add to that the little girl dressed in red who, every evening, walks her dolls in a squeaky pram up and down the main street. And while the customers at the local bar seem to regard him with reserve, even disdain, a local trio of card players urge Robert to join in to their almost perpetual card playing.Throughout all of this, Robert also attempts to solve the mystery of those who disappear into the local bogs ... or somewhere. A murder, although accidental - or was it? - occurs; and finally Robert tries to protect Jorgen, who is absolutely innocent of the crime, from community retribution.... So, what sort of a community would resort to such a litany of oddball actions? Where, exactly, is this troubling town anyway? And, why does Robert comply - so readily, it seems?The bizarrely confused nature of Robert's situation strongly implies more than simply a lone copper up against a bunch of feral farmers. Exactly what that is, I leave up to each viewer to decide. For inspiration, I'd suggest thinking of Psycho (1960), Spellbound (1945), particularly Lost Highway (1997), Bug (2006) and Shutter Island (2010), all of which center upon a character in the grip of a psychological nightmare.The acting is adequate, as is the production. Kim Bodnia is always effective in creepy roles - or any role, in fact. The structure and direction are suitable for the development of occasional suspense and muted terror. Only the ending lacks real punch, but does provide adequate resolution for me.While I'm not terribly happy about this outing, I still recommend it for those who like, as I do, Danish drama. Give it six out of ten.September 6, 20"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,reelinspiration,1,drama,2008,9,"Writer/Director Gina Prince-Bythewood, winner of the Independent Spirit Award for Sundance hit, ""Love & Basketball,"" has now brought the beloved, acclaimed best-seller, ""The Secret Life of Bees"" to the screen.1964, South Carolina. Lily Owens (played with open-eyed honestly by Dakota Fanning) is raised in a loveless home by her cruel, distant father. Fourteen year old Lily longs for a mother she never knew. When her only friend, their black maid Rosaleen, is assaulted in a racist incident, the girls are forced to go on the run. Lily and Rosaleen end up on the doorstep of the Boatwrights, the black sisters who own a successful honey farm. Lily concocts an elaborate lie to persuade the maternal August Boatwright (played with warm dignity by Queen Latifah) to temporarily take them in. They are met with some resistance from the guarded June (Alicia Keys), a classical cellist and civil rights activist. But they are welcomed enthusiastically by the open-hearted May (played with touching vulnerability by Sophie Okonedo). They soon find that hyper-sensitive May is moved to tears by the mention of anything sad.August teaches Lily how to tend the bees, and May whole heartedly embraces both girls. They are soon accepted as part of the family. But Lily still needs to find the truth of why her mother left her.This is a coming of age story and parable about how to cope with the painful truth and find forgiveness. As Lily's young love interest puts it, ""It's not just about the truth. It's about what you do with it."" The two sisters illustrate different ways to deal with the hard truths of life. June has closed her heart and built a protective wall to keep out hurtful emotions. While May has completely opened her heart and feels everyone's pain. Her heart is open to joy but it is also an open wound. I loved being in this world and a part of this loving family - so much that I stayed for a second screening. This is due in part to Gina Prince-Bythewood's excellent adaptation and the wonderful acting of Dakota Fanning, Queen Latifah, and especially Sophie Okonedo - who is literally the heart of the film.If you're looking for a sweet way to spend the afternoon, ""The Secret Life of Bees"" will supply the honey.Movie blessings!

The Strangers             ,J_M_Kiff,,horror,2008,1,"*** Warning *** Spoilers *** For such a short film, this managed to cram in every senseless cliché of the so-called horror genre. '...Girl runs from bad guys, girl trips, girls falls and hurts herself, girl whimpers, duh...' No character development, no depth, no sympathy for the characters. '... bad guys are harassing your house and threatening you, so OF COURSE you get hysterical, cry, and seek out every spooky noise...' So bad guys are hacking at your front door with an ax, you've got a loaded shotgun in your hand, but you don't shoot, you throw a chair at the door, Oh Wait, I've got a gun! But by the time you think to shoot the bad guys are gone. So your under attack from bad guys and it's just you, your girlfriend, and a loaded shotgun, so instead of hunkering down and letting them come to you to get shot, you leave your girlfriend alone in the un-secured house while you wander off to the tool shed to find and old ham radio. Sure, makes sense. So you go visit your friends and someone shoots out your windshield, do you: A- drive off fast and call 911, B- call 911 then run in the house to check on your friends, or C- dust yourself off, sneak into the house quietly, without ever bothering to wonder why your friend's car is wrecked, who's pickup truck that is, why the house is trashed, don't bother turning off the loud stereo, or calling out your friends' names, in fact don't even bother to look behind you to see if maybe the people who shot out your windshield are still around. That's right - C !?!Everyone who died in this movie deserved to die for being such mindless, spineless, insipid, whimpering idiots. Maybe if you've never seen a movie before, ever, or if you've had recent head trauma, or maybe if you're Amish this movie might scare you. Maybe. Don't waste your time or money.REVISION::: it's now Sunday 6/1. I originally posted the above comment after an advance screening of this movie late-night on thursday 5/29 (because I work at a movie theater I get to see all the movies before they're released.) So I've noticed something peculiar... there are, as of now, about 8 pages of comments on this film. About 3 pages of comments before mine (meaning before the movie came out) all gave The Strangers 9 or 10 stars, glowing reviews, and taglines like ""best horror movie ever,"" ""scariest film ever,"" and ""awesome."" But then, if you look at the dates of submission, 95% of all the comments posted after the movie was released say it's lackluster at best, anticlimactic, boring, lame, and not worth watching. So, I wonder, is that a coincidence, or maybe, just maybe, were all those people who posted great comments prior to the movie's release doing it for some other reason? Were they being paid to hype the film? Do they work for the production company? Or is it all just a big coincidence? Hmmm.... 4"
Adoration             ,larry-411,0,drama,2008,10,"""Adoration"" is, at its heart, a coming-of-age story. It's about that time of self-discovery when the question ""who am I?"" becomes an obsession. But what makes this film so startlingly refreshing is that it also has a classic structure rarely seen in contemporary cinema. The viewer is never quite sure whether or not the images on screen are real or imagined. Think of a chess game where each move prompts you to replay the entire game in your head. Such is the experience of watching ""Adoration,"" brilliantly conceived and executed by writer/director/co-producer Atom Egoyan.Egoyan is a legend in his adopted country of Canada with dozens of awards and nominations to his credit (1997's ""The Sweet Hereafter"" earned him Oscar noms for writing and directing). The mere mention of his name widens the eyes of citizens north of the border, as I learned here at the Toronto International Film Festival, where I attended the film's North American Premiere (it debuted at Cannes, where it was nominated for the prestigious Palm D'Or). Locals hold him to a very high standard. For me, I prefer going in cold, knowing as little as possible about a film. Similarly, I won't reveal much about the story here.After losing his parents under questionable circumstances, Simon (Devon Bostick) is reluctantly being raised by his Uncle Tom (Scott Speedman). Simon's memories of his mother Rachel (Rachel Blanchard), an accomplished violinist, and father Sami (Noam Jenkins) are shrouded in mystery. Enter Simon's teacher Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian), who might be able to help Simon unlock the secrets that are the key to his youthful confusion. What follows is a brain teaser which takes great concentration. The wheels are always turning, and the viewer is constantly challenged to figure out exactly what is real or perceived, and by whom.The look of the film enhances the mystery inherent in the story. The use of single-point lighting allows shadows to fall upon already-obscure settings. Music is essential to the plot and, as such, Rachel's violin virtuosity is extended to a string soundtrack that is as haunting as the film itself. Paul Sarossy's cinematography is cleverly integrated with composer Mychael Danna's soundtrack, with tracking shots set to music as a visual ballet. Editor Susan Shipton had a tall order working with Egoyan to craft a virtual puzzle in which nothing is at it seems.Speedman ably plays the father figure who isn't quite ready to take on the task of raising a teen but does so out of loyalty to his late sister. Khanjian's Sabine is simply chilling and central to the power of the film. Blanchard is a joy to watch -- simply an angel on screen (and shot that way, to boot) -- and Jenkins successfully remains an enigmatic personality throughout. But, most of all, this is Bostick's film to carry on his young shoulders. Appearing in almost every scene, it's his curiosity and angst which drive ""Adoration,"" and it's our empathy for him (weren't we all Simon once?) that gives the film its heart and soul. Bostick is one of Canada's most prolific young actors (he co-starred in Citizen Duane, one of my Top Picks from the 2006 festival) and will hopefully be introduced to a wider audience if this film gets the distribution it deserves.The moment the credits began to roll I wanted to see ""Adoration"" again. If there were back-to-back screenings I would have remained in my seat. This is the first film in recent memory which has had that effect on me. There's nothing more exciting and intriguing than a film that plays with space and time, where perception matters more than anything else. What we see on screen vs. what is in our heads -- the spaces we fill with our own thoughts -- are artfully juggled by Egoyan and the result is simply a masterpiece."
"Surfer, Dude             ",EChicoine,0,comedy,2009,1,"The abortion of thought that went into this film will shock and astonish you. For Mathew McConaughey, studying a role requires little more than his imagination. Rather than given an insightful view of a surfer's life, the audience is simply subjected to an hour and a half of what McConaughey THINKS is a lifestyle that everyone will fall in love with.Surfer Dude lacks all logic and structure. There is not enough substance here for a full movie, and yet, somehow, they managed to record SOMETHING for 85 minutes. The level of contempt McConaughey has shown for his audience is appalling.The movie starts out giving you the gut feeling that they are faking it, that they are some how cheesing it up to make fun of a horrible stereotype. Very quickly you find out that they are absolutely serious, and like a child finding out Santa isn't real, all hopes for a decent movie are lost.About half way through the film, the faint whispers of a plot start to shine through like sunlight in deep water, then the big dark rain cloud that is McConaughey moves in. Isn't there a definition for what a movie is? Simply recording onto 85 minutes of film does not constitute ""movie."" We're trying to have a civilization here Mathew! From this point on, I am avoiding all McConaughey movies. I will no longer waste my life on truly horrendous trash like Surfer Dude. On my death bed, I will say, ""I wish I never saw surfer dude with Mathew McConaughey."" and my kids and grand kids will all say ""Who's Mathew McConaughey?"""
The Merry Gentleman             ,anhedonia,,crime,2009,8,"I have a confession: I adore Kelly Macdonald's Scottish accent. It makes me go all weak in the knees, sends my heart aflutter.She is the reason I went to see ""The Merry Gentleman."" I like Michael Keaton, too, and thought his performance in ""Game 6"" (2005) was exceptionally good. I wasn't too sure how good a director he would be, but after watching ""The Merry Gentleman,"" I can safely say that Keaton is a very good filmmaker.The story of ""The Merry Gentleman"" could very well point to all the trappings of a formula: An abused woman inadvertently sees a hit man and then he befriends her with obvious intent.Given filmmakers' penchant these days to turn this sort of subject matter into yet another Tarantino or Guy Ritchie clone, the calmness with which ""The Merry Gentleman"" unfolds comes as a wonderful surprise.I realize that film-goers who want to see every hit man movie turned into another fast-talking Tarantino imitation might be sorely disappointed or even bored by ""The Merry Gentleman."" This film takes its time. It's in no hurry to get where it's going and it doesn't pander to its audience with needless bloodshed, non sequitur riffs or slam-bang car chases. This film might be about a hit man and the witness, but it is not an action film. This really is a splendid character study, paced deliberately so that we would get to know, understand, appreciate and grow to love these people.This film relies on its two main characters, Frank (Keaton) and Kate (Macdonald), to carry the film. And these two fine actors do not disappoint. Their scenes together are strikingly powerful, even when they say little. And there are many such moments in this film. Even their meet-cute, which could very well have turned into a typically corny moment, is handled with grace, charm and just enough humor to make you smile.This is a drama about human connections, more than anything else. An unconventional love story as Frank and Kate, a depressed professional killer and the mousy abused woman, slowly work their way through each other lives, through the uncomfortable moments, trying to steal moments they can share.Keaton could very easily have played Frank for a chuckle or two, given him a frenetic edge, as he often has in films. Instead, he plays him low-key. Perhaps too low-key, some could argue, but that is what I loved about his character. He really is more than a man struggling with the morality of what he does; he's a man struggling with life and all its vagaries. What he does for a living seems almost inconsequential to his struggles. Keaton finds the fine edges to his character and realizes there's more to reveal in what Frank doesn't say than in what he does. There's nothing false about Frank's weariness or sadness. This is truly a finely-tuned and subtle performance by Keaton - one of his very best.Macdonald is completely charming as Kate. Her glorious accent aside, she brings a delightful sweetness to her role. This is a real woman with genuine problems and we understand Frank's desire - and even need - to take care of her. She has suffered much and it all seems so unfair that such a creature would be in such pain. Macdonald is marvelous. She has always been a remarkably astute actress capable of immediately drawing the audience to her. Just watch her in ""The Girl in the Cafe"" (2005) and you will promptly fall in love with her. She also gave the severely under-praised performance in ""No Country For Old Men"" (2007). This is yet another wonderful performance from a terribly under-appreciated actress. Macdonald never disappoints.There are two fine supporting performances - from Bobby Cannavale as Kate's husband, and Tom Bastounes, as a cop investigating Frank's killings and also harboring a crush on Kate. Cannavale's outburst seems a bit noisy for a film this solemn, but he makes it work. And Bastounes, as a not-too-tidy cop, is just priceless. His dinner scenes with Kate contain terrific bits of acting.At a time when ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" ""Terminator Salvation,"" ""Public Enemies"" and other Hollywood films gain all the attention, it is too bad that a film such as ""The Merry Gentleman"" seemingly just gets lost in the shuffle.This is a gem of a film. It is not for anyone seeking an adrenaline rush. But is for those seeking a tender, sweet, deeply moving, at times startling film about deeply damaged people and their attempts to find some sort of solace, happiness and meaning in this life. ""The Merry Gentleman"" is a richly rewarding experience for those who appreciate good movies."
The Lucky Ones             ,RolyRoly,,adventure,2009,7,"I had tickets for this at the Toronto International Film Festival last summer but was side-tracked by an obscure little film called Slumdog Millionaire instead, so only got around to watching it last night on pay-per-view. In a strange way, the two films have a good deal in common. In an era in which everyone seems to want either tense thrillers, puerile comedies or awesome special effects (the only one here, as has been pointed out, is a cheaply put together tornado), both movies offer little more than a thoroughly improbable plot and a focus on character development. But both work remarkably well. I am puzzled by those who found that the movie dragged. While most of the plot development was telegraphed not once but several times, the acting from all three leads was both believable and very deft. At first I thought that Rachel McAdams' character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we (or even she) knew. She plays it beautifully. Tim Robbins is wonderful too, and rather pathetic, in a down-to-earth role as an aging war veteran, happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities. But Michael Pena was the real surprise. He is completely captivating in his portrayal of a proud young vet from a military family on his way to meet his girlfriend, with his masculinity compromised by a war injury. His character is the most subtly poignant as he confronts his own fears about his manhood, on several levels.Like all movies based on the Iraqi war, this seems to suffer from America's desire to ignore the war altogether, just as they ignored the Vietnam veterans a generation ago (Coming Home, The Deer Hunter). America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War I"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,tieman64,0,adventure,2013,NA,"""The Yellow Handkerchief"" is an excellent drama by Udayan Prasad. Low key, sensitive and gentle, the film watches as ex-convict Bretty Hanson (William Hurt) embarks on an impromptu road-trip with two troubled teens. The trio travel across post-Hurricane Katrina Louisiana, hoping to locate Hanson's long-lost love. If she wants to reconcile with him, she'll tie yellow handkerchiefs on her moored boat as a signal. If not, Hanson's to keep moving on.The film uses flashbacks to delve into Hanson's past life. Through these, we learn why he was incarcerated and why he and his lover, played by Maria Bello, split. The couple's relationship is mirrored to that of the film's two teenagers (Kristen Stewart and Eddie Redmayne), both of whom are social outcasts, alienated and looking for acceptance. The film's romance between Stewart and Redmayne is rushed and unconvincing. Prasad would have done better to keep things platonic.Bello and Hurt make up for this, though, with a couple strong performances. Hurt imbues his character with a quiet suffering, a sense of perpetual tiredness, whilst Bello's feisty, fiery but deeply scarred. Elsewhere the film abounds with strong, quiet moments. Consider how, when released from his prison cell, Hurt says goodbye to fellow in-mates, how he later savours his first beer in years, and how a near-worldless scene introduces him to Kristen Stewart's young character. Only in ""Handkerchief's"" final act does director Udayan Prasad abandon nuance. The rest of the film plays like a well filmed short story.No surprise, then, that the film's story was based on a famous folktale. This tale was then turned into a short story by Pete Hamill, and also a famous, now-classic song called ""Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"", sung by Dawn and Tony Orlando.8.5/10 - Worth two viewings.

Wendy and Lucy             ,commandercool88,1,drama,2009,8,"Is there no more great frontier? Has time run out on those who look west to a better tomorrow? 'Wendy and Lucy' is a small movie with its scope set on a larger, subtle target. Soft-spoken but very admirable, Kelly Reichardt has crafted a touching story of one girl's endless search for her dog.On the road to Alaska in search for better economic opportunity, Wendy finds herself in a small Oregon town where its citizens seem to live on the fringe of poverty long after job-providing factories have closed up shop. Keeping track of every penny she spends, Wendy's car suddenly won't start. And after an attempt to shoplift a bit of food sidelines her, she loses track of Lucy. A dog, a companion, and her best friend.A determined Wendy searches for Lucy in every nook and cranny. Played by a quiet Michelle Williams, this is a subdued performance but a strong one. A portrait of loneliness, of heartbreak. She lives a life far from fortunate, but she holds her head high and looks to Alaska for hope. And in a small neighborhood where her situation seems to only go from bad to worse, Wendy has nobody to rely on but a friendly elderly security guard. Giving her a sense of moral support she probably is in desperate need for, we expect emotion. But staring panic in the face, Wendy remains strong. Her first moment of visible emotional anguish and vulnerability comes after a terrifying encounter in a forest in the middle of the night. A glimpse into her future as a vagabond? 'Wendy and Lucy' comes at a time when our own economy is in a state of perpetual free fall, which helps Reichardt drive her timely message home. It is these often seemingly mundane and unimportant everyday activities that may cause the film to drag, though it comes in at a slim 80 minutes. But it is these events that help the film and Williams find personality. 'Wendy and Lucy' asks us to be strong, to stick with our character. And it offers an ending that will pull at the heartstring of even the most hardened cynic. A tough, very challenging situation you and I would never want to find ourselves in. It speaks of conviction, of doing the right thing even when it's impossibly difficult.Raw but surprisingly gripping, Reichardt does much with little. It's a touching picture, a bittersweet one. 'Wendy and Lucy' may feel minor, but it's a fine piece of beautifully told cinema. A snapshot that gains more appreciation upon reflection.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
Hancock             ,The_Dead_See,0,action,2008,8,"I've read a lot of the reviews here complaining about the film flagging in its final act. I respectfully disagree.Hancock is most definitely DIFFERENT in it's last half - it drops off the comedy significantly and introduces some fascinating superhero mythology that is almost like an ancient Greek myth in its context. It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kid-friendly summer blockbuster that they are. However, both halves have their own merits - the first being the humour, and the second being the (almost tragic) origin mythos. I suspect if you are prepared for the switch in tone, rather than shocked when it arrives, you might enjoy Hancock as much as I did. 2"
The Women             ,katiemeyer1979,1,comedy,2008,4,"Insane really. Even if you haven't seen the original George Cukor movie with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What has she done to herself? Her face can hardly move. That alone puts her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should be suing the DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses with no connection in the public's subconscious trying to pass for friends, totally unconvincingly. Eva Mendes in the Joan Crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a trans-gender performer without any taste or subtlety. Bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women.The only positive things I can mention are a short but very funny appearance by Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as the housekeeper. 1"
What Happens in Vegas             ,Terryfan,1,comedy,2015,7,Despite some bad rap this film is not really bad it just needs to be watch to understand.What Happens In Vegas centers around Joy McNally (Played by Cameron Diaz) who travels to Las Vegas after being dumped by her fiancé Mason (Played by Jason Sudeikis) with her best friend Tipper (Played by Tipper)Where the same time Jack Fuller (Played by Ashton Kuctcher) and Hater (Played by Rob Corddy) his best friend and Lawyer after Jack was fired by his boss/father Jack Fuller Sr (Played by Treat Williams). Unaware Joy and Jack ended up in the same room and end up after a one night stand getting married and when Jack used her quarter to win 3 million dollars. The Judge order them to make their marriage or they will never seen a dime of the money.Which of course leads up to a series of events in the marriage. Now the story is interesting and in a way original considering plus they have several creative humor in the film which makes you roll on the floor laughing and find yourself repeating.Ashton and Cameron make for a interesting on screen couple through out the film and they do very well with making us laugh. Lake makes for a interesting best friend as does Rob.The songs used in the film work as well as it helps the story in terms of story telling. The film is just not a classic but it is not a bad one either it is just one you have to watch to understand.It has a original plot with some good performance from Ashton and Cameron so if you're curious give it a try.I give What Happens In Vegas an 7 out of

La siciliana ribelle             ,sergepesic,1,crime,2012,NA,"Sicily and mafia. It would be a first thought an average person would have, however unjust or unfair it might be. "" The Sicilian Girl"" is a strange, a bit clunky movie, torn between the court drama and passionate bloody opera. The medieval, macabre, isolated world of rural Sicily, with its outdated sense of honor and codes of conduct, that nobody else would understand or relate to. The heroine of this movie is a strong willed, privileged young woman, trying to avenge the death of her father and brother. Gradually, she manages to accept the fact that they both, were criminals, like the people she hated. The movie is missing something hard to explain,firmer shape, and there is a bad choice of casting the unfortunate leading actress prone to overactin"
Yes Man             ,freddy_at_home,0,comedy,2008,10,"First of all I would like to say that this movie might seem like Liar Liar at first sight, but it is not!I think this movie is both funny and sweet. What if one word could change everything? I found myself wondering this after leaving the cinema, and I left it with a satisfied feeling of quality.This is the best Jim Carrey movie I have seen in years. I really enjoyed it and so did the rest of the audience too...And I love the soundtrack on this, the song he has as a ring-tone, Journey - Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) is great, fantastic! I feel real good when I heard it, and the movie made me smile, but not just smile, also feel something! I felt real joy!!I must congratulate the director and the cast for a job well done! You made a movie that really works, and for that I am grateful! Good movies are rear these days. 9/10 for me, will buy it on blue-ray when it comes."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,Pavla_M,1,comedy,2009,1,"I gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer I thought - what an unfunny movie full of clichés. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. What a waste of time... The movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that also is pretty passé. I couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because I found them utterly stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally."
Deception             ,seawalker,0,crime,2008,4,"Two things to say about this film.Firstly, what an astoundingly rubbish title for a movie. ""Deception""??? Oh, come on. Can you think of a more non-committal, less interesting, less imaginative title for a movie? I can't. All thrillers are about deception, of one kind or another.""Deception"" originally went into production under the title ""The List"". Hmm... Well... OK. I admit it. That title is also pretty bad. Then, ""Deception"" was going to be called ""The Tourist"". Now, I kind of like that. Sounds art house and kind of strange. Conjures up images of an observer, an outsider. Somebody not in the loop. In fact, pretty much the character that Ewan McGregor plays.Secondly, what a completely rubbish movie! OK, maybe not completely rubbish. Just mostly rubbish.""Deception"" is a good 20 minutes too long. After a while it just seems to go on and on. The climax is misjudged and mistimed. The sex is typical Movies 24 soft core erotica, or maybe a Friday night Channel 5 movie from the early Noughties. You know the kind of thing. Soft focus humping to a soundtrack of screaming saxophone driven jazz. (Mind you don't trip over the cliché, there chief!) Also, every plot twist in ""Deception"" is signposted way in advance. If you don't get at least one of the major plot twists then, frankly, you really should give up watching movies. Pretty lame, pretty dull, pretty bad movie.I said 'mostly rubbish', so some of it must have been good. Yes?I did like the film's chilly, European ambiance. I liked the idea of powerful people, too isolated and too busy to develop human relationships. I liked Hugh Jackman's well dressed and cold instigator, Ewan McGregor's lonely accountant and Michelle Williams' bruised vulnerability. I thought all three leads made the most of their underwritten roles, but sadly it was not enough.There is plenty of space in this world for a good, sexualised thriller (see the original ""Basic Instinct""), but sadly ""Deception"" was nothing like a good sexualised thriller. 1"
Trucker             ,Movie_Muse_Reviews,1,drama,2010,NA,"What embodies the lonely, self-dependent person than the trucker? Hours upon hours of driving with nothing but some music and one's own thoughts. We've seen this protagonist before, just not in the form of the beautiful Diane (Michelle Monaghan) cussing and driving a truck. The opening scene with Diane getting a quick sexual fix, pulling out a cigarette and hitting the road without saying more than a word or two is not exactly original character development, but James Mottern's debut film hits a notably real chord in all its silence and familiarity.When Diane gets stuck with Peter, an 11-year-old boy who as it turns out is the son she abandoned an infancy, suddenly ""Trucker"" has the workings of an ""unlikely pair go on a road trip comedy."" Fortunately, that tired concept of two people who don't like each forming a bond pretty much ends after the first third of the film and everything becomes much more real. After all, Diane is watching Peter because his dad, her ex-husband, is dying of colon cancer -- not your typical circumstance. And rather than Diane and Peter slowly reconnecting as mother and son throughout, there are much more ups and downs.Occasionally ""Trucker"" will dip into cliché, namely in its handling of mother-son dialogue. Peter is a smart kid with real kid issues of wanting to be loved and showing it by provoking adults, but a couple times Mottern has him drift into the kid who says something intelligent and revealing about the older character who is frozen by the comment and considers it in a lingering camera shot at the end of the scene. Mottern keeps the film quiet and subtle for so much of it and these techniques put little cracks into his vision.But Mottern must be thankful for this strong core cast. Monaghan excels in her first dramatic starring role. Diane is not the most complicated of characters to solve, but Monaghan keeps her from ever becoming an open book. Her lone wolf speak-your-mind mentality is much more at odds with the small kernel of her that wants to make meaningful connections with the people who have suddenly become close to her. The young Jimmy Bennett also impresses as Peter, having a lot more scenes requiring self-awareness and meaningful discussion that most child actors. Nathan Fillion, who plays Diane's friend Runner also works his charms and Benjamin Bratt as the dying father earns our sympathy quickly despite his minimal screen time.""Trucker"" could have done with half the number of driving in a truck to contemplative indie music transition sequences, but that's just the kind of film it is. It has that timeless, expected story line of two people who slowly forge a relationship they didn't think they wanted but both need, yet some unpredictable moments and solid performances throughout that keep its message fresh a create genuine sympathy for its characters.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.c"
One Missed Call             ,plumberguy66,0,horror,2008,5,"Facts: As of 4.27.08 the rating for this movie is 2.9 Nearly EVERY review is negative. The accusations leveled over and over are: worst movie ever, terrible, trash, stupid and the like. Here's my sad story about One Missed Call:It was a rainy Sunday afternoon (I live in Seattle) so I went to the local video store looking for a mindless movie to watch while laying about. While perusing the selections I saw IT <U+0096> not the Stephen King movie but the most vilified movie in recent memory: One Missed Call, staring at me from the shelf. I almost felt it call to me and for a fraction of a second my hand, with a mind of its own, started to reach out for it. Needless to say, I retrieved my composure and hurried away. Having read the reviews on IMDb, and so KNOWING it was something to avoid at all costs, I felt shameful and dirty at having let my guard down as I did. As I walked a little further down the aisle I spotted another movie: Reservation Road. Thank goodness! Redemption!, I thought as I picked up a copy; feeling once again like sensible individual. As I headed for the front counter, reading the back of the box, it said Reservation Road was something to the effect of being a deep, emotional story. Not exactly the mindless fare for a rainy Sunday! So, completely loosing my mind and throwing caution to the wind, I snuck back and returned the copy of Reservation Road. Then, making certain no one else was around, grabbed a copy One Missed Call. I quickly tucked THE movie under my arm so that no passers-by could read the title and know the poor decision I had just made. As I made my way to the counter, I made sure no line of happy movie renters were there so as to avoid their judging eyes. Safely at the counter, to throw-off some of my guilt, I made a joke with the clerk about how I was going to regret my selection but am a die-hard horror fan and therefore excused. He looked completely unaffected. I hurriedly paid and headed out the door with my guilty secret. Once home, I popped the disc in, settled onto my couch and readied myself for disappointment. Funny thing though: About half way through the feature I started thinking about how similar this movie was to another movie I had seen - The Ring. The Ring, when it hit the theaters and ultimately DVD, got huge, rave reviews. Strangely though, once I, personally, saw The Ring - and after all the hype - was ultimately disappointed. The Ring wasn't a bad movie, in my opinion, but it also was not deserving of all the accolades either <U+0096> again, in my opinion. So, here I am watching One Missed Call, comparing it to The Ring and now thinking the end has got to be the reason everyone is calling this a stinker. Well, I got to the end and was sitting there with furrowed brow thinking: What did I miss? Where is the movie that everyone hates so much? I don't feel ripped-off or violated. I don't even feel as if I was condescended to. What happened? I suspect this was a case of jumping on the proverbial bandwagon. I thought we had are OWN opinions and shared them, here on IMDb, honestly. I have a very hard time believing that the same demographic gave The Ring 7.3, AVP: Requiem 5.1 (which SUUUUCKED) and One Missed Call 2.9. There is a serious disturbance in the force here. I used to trust the opinions and ratings on here. Ultimately this single incident has shaken my confidence in IMDb and the people casting their votes (much like the general elections of 2000 & 2004).I hope one day I will once again be able to enter IMDb with the belief that I will be able to take away from it the knowledge needed to make a sensible movie renting choice. Until then, I will have to stumble through the video store alone, unarmed and destined to fall into the crags of bad movie selections. A sad story indeed. I fear I will run out of room soon so, I'll end here. Cheers! Thanks for reading."
Frozen River             ,CihanVercan,1,crime,2009,7,"Reminded me Ridley Scott's Thelma&Louise(1991), this film debut of director and writer Courtney Hunt delivers us a compulsory participation of the two opposite characters. Melissa Leo and Misty Upham perform two innocent and mature women driven into the crime world after desperation.Frozen River carries a vital independent spirit that even though the value of contents of the film is so unassuming, it brings in both sentimental and intellectual prestige. Directing, editing and storytelling are so plain. Cinematography, lights and sound work, score are out-of-service. There is absolutely no cinematic aspect but the theme. Since it's an independent production we primarily come across to a thorough presentation of this theme. It has been worked up so effectively and is as plausible as a documentary.A great commitment and well-created atmosphere by Courtney Hunt. All actors have done a good job. Might feel boring if not seen for personal view."
Yes Man             ,TxMike,0,comedy,2009,NA,"Jim Carrey to me is always better when he has a serious part and minimizes his goofy physical comedy. That is the kind of role he has here as Carl Allen, single banker who might be best described as a ""no"" man. He turns down marginal loan applications and generally avoids doing things he thinks will be a bother. His best friend calls but he makes up excuses why he can't do things, and instead just wants to hide out at his place and watch a movie on DVD.But this story is about him becoming a ""yes"" man. He meets old friend John Michael Higgins as Nick who claims to be enjoying life more than ever since he has become a ""yes"" man, saying ""yes"" to life and taking chances. So by Nick's invitation Carl attends the seminar conducted by Terence Stamp as Terrence Bundley, and in an atmosphere similar to a charismatic revival, Carl commits to becoming a ""yes"" man.His first challenge is a homeless man who asks for a ride to a park (where we soon find he lives in the bushes). When Carl runs out of gas and has to walk down to a service station, he happens to meet pretty and quirky Zooey Deschanel as Allison, who offers him a ride back up the hill on the back of her scooter. In the grand scheme of things Carl would never have met Allison if he had not said ""yes"" to that homeless man looking for a ride.As the story continues to unfold Carl gets himself in some awkward situations by saying ""yes"" all the time, and some friends take advantage of him because of it, knowing he will never say ""no"" to anything. But the story also makes the point that ""yes"" always comes with conditions, that you use your common sense to filter things, and sometimes the best options really is to say ""no."" There is an overriding truth to the whole message, that in life we need to be open to new experiences because we never know what good will come of them.In spite of their 18 year age difference, Carl and Allison connect and by the end of the movie it seems that they may have a budding love relationship.Good, entertaining movie. I saw it with Natalie and Miranda (both 20) and they both enjoyed it as much as I di"
Sex and the City             ,Utlkn2me,1,comedy,2008,3,"I'm a great female fan of the HBO series, but this film is not in the same league. I am so disappointed. I just saw it when the DVD came out, and had intentionally avoided reading reviews here, but totally agree with many that I'm now reading.It looks like the producers just wanted to make quick money, decided what they thought would appeal to the movie-going public, and said to heck with the loyal series fans. The movie characters mostly do not resemble nor act like those from HBO, and the storyline was just plain stupid and kept going for cheap humor. These women act even more immature than they did when the series ended, and the Carrie/Big storyline made no sense. OK, he didn't have her new phone number, but did he not know where she lived? Come on - a whole year would pass, and he wouldn't make a single attempt to see her. (He went to Paris to get her in the last series episode, but couldn't have his limo driver take him over to her apartment?) How many times during the series did they show his sitting in the limo waiting for her outside her building.The actors in general had no passion, and it looked like they were phoning in their lines. It could have been so good - just have picked up where the series left off and go from there.Things they shouldn't have done (IMHO): 1 - Sent the girls to Mexico; 2 - Had Samantha get that dog; 3 - Have Samantha's and Smith's relationship end that way; 4 - Have Charlotte get pregnant; 5 - Had Carrie treat Big the way she did, and his staying away from her for a year; 6 - Have the male characters barely participate in the movie; 7 - Left out ""The City"" - Where was New York? I did not get the feel for NYC like I did in the series.I could go on and on and on. I just wished that they'd done justice to the serie"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,joebloggscity,0,animation,2008,7,"A kid's film is a kid's film. Simple as that, and not every single one needs to have the grown-up's interest themes or jokes as in Shrek, or the elaborate musical numbers. Younger kids want a bit of action, humour and fun little characters they can love to watch. Add in a good simple feel good story with some adventure, and that is a great formula for a kid's film; and that is the premise and basis of the animated movie: ""Fly me to the Moon"".The film is simply about 3 young friends (who are bees) who decide to hitch a lift with Buzz Aldrin & co to the Moon, back in the 1960s. Their mothers don't know about it, the Soviet Officials (flies again!) don't like it and they themselves are simply wide-eyed about the whole thing. Along the way, there's thrills and fun for young kids. They can relate to the humour and the characters (out to seek adventure and all that).The added plus is that this is a fully 3D-animated film, and for the first time i've ever seen that the 3D animation effects are astoundingly good and actually work. Having watched Jaws 3D and the like in my youth, I was not expecting much and had to eat my words when viewing this. Watching this in the IMAX, the opening scene with the rocket launch made my eyes almost pop out, it was like as if the rocket was coming off the screen! I'm surprised and disappointed with much of the negative criticisms in the forum reviews on this movie. I don't practically ever watch kids movies, but got dragged to this by my nephew & niece, and can say that it was worth it. All loved it, as did all the kids in the audience from what I could see. It does as it says on the tin.Maybe Shrek, Toy Story et al have more going for them in many ways, but as a film in itself ""Fly me to the moon"" deserves credit for entertainment & enjoyment for young kids in particular who want to see a film they can fully understand and enjoy. One to sit back and enjoy, but most importantly if you can watch this in 3D in the cinema then that's where you'll enjoy it the most"
Mamma Mia!             ,fionaallen,1,comedy,2008,10,"I saw this film at the screening on Sunday and was not too sure of what to expect from it. I hadn't seen the west end show so was not really aware of the story line but that really did not matter.As soon as the first song started I was loving it! The actors may not be that great at singing but does it matter?! They are actors after all and this is not the west end! The actors play the parts really well and make fun of themselves at the same time. The story line is fun and has laughs for all ages. Julie Waters is her fantastic self in it and Meryl Streep plays the mother really well. The dance scenes are great and well put together. Loads of people in the cinema were singing and dancing in their seats so just enjoy it and have some laughs for a few hours.If you take it for what it is, a fun laugh out loud film with good actors and fantastic songs, then you will enjoy this film so much.I suspect that this will be a summer box office hit! Enjoy it and have fun - you may need your tissues though as I'm pretty sure some of you will be crying with laughter at some of the scenes. 3"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,adoniamiddleton,0,adventure,2010,7,"So to be honest I hadn't even heard of this movie until my friend invited me to its showing at Kabuki Theatre here in San Francisco. Being completely available as usually I figured I would go and support not only the movie but also my friend's addition; which is Kristen Stewart. This movie had me not knowing what emotion to go with. One moment I think I'm supposed to be scared, and then I find myself laughing and lastly wanting to be in love. Overall this entire movie kept me in suspense and I can honestly say I didn't know where I was going until I got there (which would be the perfect description of this move). I think this movie is worth taking for a ride; so buckle up and get ready for this emotional roller coaster"
The Merry Gentleman             ,jdesando,,crime,2009,NA,"""I'd say we've been pretty good for one another,"" Kate (Kelly Macdonald)Well, not quite, but that statement is consistent with naïve young Brit Kate's cluelessness since she's talking to an accomplished assassin, Frank (Michael Keaton), whom she recently befriended and believes to be a good Samaritan. But that sense of being just a bit out of it is characteristic of Michael Keaton's first directorial effort, The Merry Gentleman, as well.I could feel Keaton struggling to offer a thriller in the David Mamet tradition (without his caustic language) with minimalist dialogue and exposition and a concentration on character. Without Mamet's poetic language, Keaton is left with spare dialogue that barely explains the motivations for abuse and murder involving more than one character.It is, however, mostly Kate I wanted to know, and I was not fulfilled because of her limited capacity to speak loud and clear. Caught as she is between the growing interest of Detective Dave Murcheson (Tom Bastounes) and Frank, and her abusive husband, this woman causes a great deal of trouble by just being beautiful, caring, and out there. And ignorant of her charm and the kind of rogue male she is attracted to.Among the several motifs Keaton rams through, the idea of ""good"" appears regularly. Calling someone good who is not is a cheap way of doubling up on irony but doing little to expand the meaning of ""bad."" Most of all I am disappointed in the ending. Some closure is necessary in most fiction.Not a bad film; just not great"
Four Christmases             ,wilsonfamily1,1,comedy,2009,1,"I always thought that all films had to contain at least one character you could like or at worst empathise with. When a film begins with its 'heroes' lying to their parents I found it impossible to 'bond' with them. This film then spends the bulk of its airtime showing us how awful Witherspoon & Vaughn's families are ,and how little Witherspoon & Vaughn know about each other. The presumed payoff is that they become (partly) reconciled to their families and (we assume) keep them in their lives. It was, therefore, a cynical surprise that the last scene made it obvious that Witherspoon & Vaughn's characters had reverted to type. This film has a 12A certificate in the UK, meaning that small children can see it; it has several unsuitable scenes, including the sex in the toilet opening and Vaughn destroying the Santa Claus story. All in all a romantic Christmas comedy that was neither romantic, nor Christmassy nor funny"
Wendy and Lucy             ,StarsDown,1,drama,2009,9,"Sometimes the simplest stories are the most effecting and the simplest characters are the most endearing. Wendy and Lucy is a perfect example of this. When discussing this film however one must praise Michelle Williams. Before she even utters a word with her body movement and her facial features we get a sense of who Wendy is. We have seen this character before and we know her. Wendy is a simple girl with a simple purpose but Michelle Williams gives her the grace and kindness that makes her seem real and is all the more gut wrenching when things start crashing down around her. Most actresses her age with her resume would scoff at the idea of playing such a simple and expressionless character who hasn't showered for days and wears cut off brown pants and an unflattering blue sweatshirt but she breathes life into Wendy and adds an extra dimension to her. Of course a great performance would be wasted without a narrative for Wendy.As the film unfolds the narrative is quite simplistic. Wendy is stuck in a small town in Oregon on her way to Alaska and wants to get on her way as fast as possible before her money runs out. There however are events that will unfold that prevent this from happening. There is little surprise and in fact the narrative is quite predictable with most events foreshadowed. As these events unfold however they are still impactful and meaningful because Wendy does not see them coming. As simplistic as this narrative may be there is complexity to it in the form of political commentary on small town America and how the people that live there are struggling. Wendy herself is fleeing Indiana living in her car and managing a small sum of money to go to the promise land of Alaska since they are hiring. The town is suffering from the closing of a mill with few jobs and is inhabited by many disenfranchised individuals. While this film could be fixated on these points Kelly Reichardt has crafted them very subtlety into the character and the setting. Characters don't stand around saying small own America is dying, but we can easily pick this up from the plot and the visuals of a broken down town with many closed business and downtrodden individuals. Usually films of this type heap on background but instead there are only a few scenes to decipher Wendy's story and motivation.The soundtrack for this film is Wendy humming quietly to herself which when employed help foster a sense of intimacy. Kelly Reichardt shoots the film with a naturalistic feel with a steady and fluid motion of the camera. There are many long takes with tracking shots as the camera follows Wendy as she walks around this town but this is contrasted with close ups where the camera gets in tight to see the expressions on Wendy's face. There is only natural light used and most of the scenes take place out doors with wind blowing through Wendy's hair and building being nothing more than a backdrop. All of these aspects together create a sense of intimacy with Wendy. Wendy and Lucy shows us that a great film really only needs a honest and meaningful connection to a character through narrative, acting and mise-en-scène."
Pride and Glory             ,bigtimage,,crime,2008,1,"I don't usually write comments, but this movie was just awful. First, I never sleep during a movie, even when I'm tired. But this movie was just that boring. It had a good storyline, but expressed it ways that are unbelievably terrible. The plot jumped from place to place until the extent that it didn't make sense anymore. Some parts weren't even necessary. As such, the beginning (the random football game) had no point and the ending didn't tie all the loose ends. The lighting was dim and barely visible at times. The camera was unstable and shaky, which makes no sense in a dramatic movie such as this (does better in a movie like Quarantine). This is probably because the movie, instead of using a rail, carried it by hand in some parts. It made the unnecessary scene into longer scene, whereas the action and the ""important dialogue"" was cut up into short pieces. The editing and transitions could also use a lot of work too. There were scenes where a different language was used, but no subtitles were given (which is practically a middle finger in my case). Everybody swears: ""fuck,"" ""shit,"" ""bitch,"" it's as if the actors had just quit smoking or it was their period. Finally, the acting was probably mediocre at best all together, even with more experienced actors like Edward Norton and Colin Farell. If you like a good movie, watch Body of Lies or something that doesn't make you say ""I was expecting more,"" or ""What the hell was that piece of crap?"" Do anything, but don't watch this movie."
Nim's Island             ,zonistonate,1,adventure,2008,8,"""Although this movie is geared towards a younger audience, it has it's own innocent allure for the adult audience as well. With whimsical characters and exotic locations, the writers have managed to create a lovely little world that pulls you in and entertains you.The actors all do a good job in their respective roles. Abigail Breslin is a delight in the title role of Nim and both Jody Foster and 300's Gerard Butler both show us they can entertain us in a different genre then we are used to seeing them. Foster is convincing in this comedic turn as writer Alexandra Rover and the charming Scottish Butler, in a dual role as Nim's father and Foster's adventurous alter ego, shows us glimpses of why he has suddenly become Hollywood's new ""go to"" leading man.This movie works as family entertainment, but there is something for everyone to enjoy, as evidenced by the adult turnout in the theaters"
Twilight             ,bob the moo,1,misc,2009,NA,"There is no point in pretending it  I'm a man in his thirties and I'm not target audience for this film. So the fact that I rented it is just a ""bonus"" few pounds in the pockets of the makers since they clearly weren't aiming this film at me. Who they were aiming it at appears to have been the army of teenage girls who have been reading the Twilight books religiously  again. I'd never even heard of the books so this is really something off my cultural radar. Regardless I decided to give the film a try without really knowing the plot or what it was meant to be. What I found was the first part in a longer story about a human teenager who moves back to her small town and falls for a boy who turns out to be one of a group of teenage vampires who feed off the blood of animals rather than people.I have no problems with the teenage aspect of the story but somehow it really failed to engage me as it was not only too superficial but didn't even really do that particularly well. The film plays like it has been written around events without a great deal of depth, complexity or characterisation in it, which is a surprise considering the fertile ground the world of teenage love and acceptance is. Sadly it comes off all too bland and obvious for my tastes and I rarely could bring myself to care about what was going on. The direction is a bit too serious at times but it also lacks passion and the breathlessness that the material suggests it must have once had if it did captivate a teenage audience. Of course I could be just missing the point because perhaps the cast are a big part of it working and this is lost on me.Certainly the appeal of much of the cast is lost on me totally. Stewart has something about her but cannot translate it into something meaningful here, leaving her character feeling a bit one-dimensional. However compared to Pattinson she looks like one of the finest actresses of her generation because he is about as dull and vapid as he could have been without trying. OK maybe his immortal, unsleeping character has to have something weirdly ""dead"" about him but this should not be a detrimental part of his performance as it is here. I shan't bother to list those below them because nobody really captured my interest in terms of their characters or performances.Twilight is not a bad film, it is just a very bland one that lacks passion, heart or excitement. Maybe the target audience will strongly disagree (I'd be shocked if they did not) but having watched this for myself I fail to see what not only the fuss is about  but why anyone would really consider this to be a good film."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,joe_momma9,,animation,2008,NA,"I've been a fan of Veggie Tales since they came out. They were funny and sent a great message. This was possibly the most boring animated movie I've ever seen. Now granted I'm in my twenties but I still enjoy kids cartoon movies, so when I see one I don't like, I try to hear the reaction from the kids in the audience to see how they enjoy it. Aside from a chuckle every now and then, none of the kids were laughing during the movie. I think the main problem is that there's a lot of dialog. So, coming from a life long fan of the Veggie Tales, it's probably best to keep the kids at home and throw in one of Veggie classics."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,goldenswim,1,misc,2008,1,"What a disappointment. I had been looking forward to seeing this and it was a bust! I've read the book and know a lot about the history of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII and this was just awful. The rape scene was the worst! When baby Henry was born and he did not go to see him was the second worst! I just wish they could have been more accurate with the facts of history but maybe this is just too big a topic/story for a short movie. Much better as a miniseries. I also think it just all felt rushed. It would have been nice to see some more pleasant interaction between Anne and the king. King Henry had a smoldering quality, but the chemistry was lacking with Anne. He really seemed to have more affection for Mary - why was a mystery. Just did not like the movie at all."
La siciliana ribelle             ,SnoopyStyle,1,crime,2016,NA,"Rita Mancuso's father is beloved Don Michele in Balata, Sicily. He orders the death of Bellafiore who murdered innocent peasants. A prosecutor arrives to confront him but the villagers support the Don rather than the corrupt incompetent police. Six years later, Rita is 17 and the village is awash with drugs. Her brother Carmelo gets killed and Rita brings in her evidence to the prosecutor who actually got her father's respect. She testifies against the Sicilian mob as revenge for her family's murders.The story is somewhat muddled. Veronica D'Agostino is good as the fierce heroine. She isn't a pretty little thing but she has a nice vulnerability. Gérard Jugnot is also good. The material is there but the intensity is dispersed. The tension comes and goes. This should be a great character study of the Girl but the final ending should not be as confuse"
Ghost Town             ,J_Trex,0,misc,2008,9,"The main character, Bertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais) is a Manhatten Dentist and a misanthrope. When the Dentist he shares an office with invites Bert to some cake and champagne to celebrate the birth of his child, Bert looks at him like he's a panhandler asking for change and tells him to ""start without me"".When Bert gets a routine colonoscopy, he reacts adversely & dies for 7 minutes, but is revived. However, the result is he is able to see dead people. These aren't just any ordinary ghosts, but ghosts who continue to haunt their previous Manhatten neighborhoods, where they died, until something happens in the real world that will allow them to move on.One such ghost is Frank (Greg Kinnear), a philandering Manhatten playboy type, who is pestering Bert to intervene on his behalf to get his widow, Gwen (Tea Leoni) to break up with her fiancé, because Frank ""thinks he's just after her for her money"".Bert agrees, but then falls for Gwen himself, and gradually is transformed from a curmudgeon into a much better person (shades of Ebeneezer Scrooge!).This may sound like a tired plot that's been overdone many times before, but somehow it works very nicely here. I thought Ricky Gervais, Tea Leoni, & Greg Kinnear were all excellent. Gervais was particularly good as the lead. His understated British comedic talents were well suited to the role. The supporting cast was great also. Kristen Wiig (from SNL) turned in a hilarious role as the surgeon who botched the colonoscopy.What I liked most about this was that it worked on a number of levels, as a very good comedy, a ghost story, a romance, and a story of redemption.Go check it out at the theater. You'll be glad you did."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,ThreeGuysOneMovie,0,crime,2012,NA,"How would you like to watch a Danish film noir/classic western with some elements of a good twilight zone episode tossed in for good measure? Intrigued yet? Well you should be, director Genz's film Terribly Happy is such a fun watch, it will almost make you forget your reading subtitles. While part of the wave of Scandinavian imports to resonate with American Audiences recently, like the films Troll Hunter, Let the Right One In and the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Terribly Happy is its own unique beast.Robert (Jakob Cedergren) is a police officer from Denmark, that has been reassigned to a small Danish hamlet. Robert is sent to serve a penance after making some mistakes in Copenhagen. South Jutland where Robert finds himself is a spartan land, filled with bogs, mud, cows and rubber boots. The local townspeople welcome Robert with less than open arms. It appears South Jutland is a town where people take care of their own, it's a rural one bar, one shop, one doctor place where everyone knows everyone elses business yet keeps to themselves.The first friendly face Robert sees is that of Ingerlise (Lene Maria Christensen), the wife of the local bully Jorgen (Kim Bodnia). Ingerlise confides in Robert that she is being abused, but she is reluctant to do anything about her situation. The townspeople are well aware what is going on in town, but have their own views of both Ingerlise and Jorgen. Will Robert compromise his own moral compass to fit in with the town provincial societal norms?Director Genz creates a dark intimidating atmosphere that permeates every inch of the screen. The characters are multidimensional leaving you to question and reassess their motivations and actions as the film progresses. The blending of several classic genres, western, noir and dark comedy, is achieved in no small part to the wonderful dialogue, and cinematography in the film. The characters seem real, albeit exceedingly creepy and your sense of right and wrong will be put to the test.There has been a lot of talk of remaking this film in the United States. Director Genz has signed on for the project, however details about the project seems to have dried up since early in 2010. It's interesting to note that Terribly Happy is supposedly based on a true story. Novel writer, and eccentric Erling Jepsen claims the story is based on a distant aunt and uncle. If you get a chance check out the bonus features, to watch an amazing interview with Genz and Jespen, where Jespen slaps Genz several times causing him to walk out of the interview.Fans of the Coen Brothers films, David Lynch, and modern film noir in general will find a lot to enjoy about Terribly Happy. The film is a dark and memorable addition to the fine films that have been coming from Scandinavia in recent years. Upon viewing its easy to see why the film was nominated for, and claimed so many international film festival awards. Head on down to South Jutland and give Terribly Happy a watch just don't forget to bring your rubber boots and a loaded pistol.Like what you see here? Then check out our full site at 3guys1movie.c"
Goodbye Solo             ,jimifilm,0,drama,2008,9,"I was trying all week to get these tickets for GOODBYE SOLO at the London Film Fest because I've seen both the directors previous works which had also played there- Man Push Cart and Chop Shop. As soon as the film began i became mesmerized by the seamless blend of the story and photography. Solo is a good natured cabbie from senegal, trying to balance happiness for himself as well as the responsibilities he has for his wife and daughter alex. As Solo develops a relationship with an old man, William - it hits him, he realizes this old man is going to jump off a mountain and he must save him- and his day to day responsibilities shift dramatically, creating a new world for Solo. He even brings in Alex to help him- the three make a new, simply warm friendship. I really felt for Solo and his desire to save the old man who wouldn't bend from his own path. the evolution of their relationship to the very end- made this a truly captivating and real experience you just don't get from the theaters nowadays. not only i really wanted to know what would happen next, but the first half was really funny. i mean, people were laughing out loud, which is different from ramin bahrani's other films. i absolutely recommend this film because it digs deep into you and doesn't let go for days after. I was also lucky enough that the director and the actor (whose name is also Solo) were there and i was able to personally congratulate them on their creation. that guy solo is really good. everyone was commenting on him. check this out if you get a chance."
Gomorrah             ,xxrotini,,crime,2009,2,"What a disappointing movie this was. Scattered, no real storyline or characters to grow attached to (with one exception), boring, plodding, this movie was a doozy. How it got the critical acclaim that it's received is beyond me, but honestly 10 minutes into the movie I wanted to leave, but no, I had obligated myself to train wreck, so I sat and watched, and was in a p-o'd daze for a good long amount of time.Here are some fundamental problems with the flick: 1) the context for what's going on is either not there or it's provided at the end, so while you're watching the scenes you have no clue what's going on--the movie ends and there are a few story lines where I'm still baffled why it was even included and occupied 25-30 minutes of the movie's screen time; 2) the end of the movie has 5 factoids of what you'd want to know about the mob in Italy trying to add a rationale for watching the last 2.5 hours (that felt like 4.5 hours), and that's just lame, have it at the beginning, but don't just be like: here's a reason for spending your time on this; 3) it doesn't succeed as a drama because you don't know motive or have characters with depth (the exception being a 14 year old boy and an old man who distributes checks, both those characters worked for me), and it doesn't succeed as an action/thriller, because there's no suspense or action; 4) I was bored.

Righteous Kill             ,doofy-8,0,crime,2008,1,"This film is appalling. De Niro is 65, Pacino is 68, Dennehey is 70. Serious actors who have all done some brilliant work in their time labouring under the delusion that they can act 'young'. And of course they can't. It is embarrassing. Clint used to be the master(?) of this genre, Harrison Ford has had a shot at it - but to see actors of the calibre of De Niro and Pacino having a go is dreadful; surely they did not need the money... De Niro's love interest is in her 30s and looks it - despite having had enough botox to sink a ship. In the real world De Niro can pull a mid 30s woman because of his money and power, but as a humble detective? I think not. There are mild sex scenes - spoiler alert? - and they make you wince. Even the basic stuff like, er, movement is cut to protect the guilty; starting with a full body shot and then cutting to upper body only. UK readers of this comment over 50 might recall Dixon of Dock Green and how, as he aged, there were less full body walking shots and the 'running' looked a bit silly. There are loads of buddy movies out there, often with the hard nosed lieutenant, and this does not begin to compete. Because the leads are too old. I am all for 'willing suspension of disbelief', but Dennehey (at 70) threatening a 68 year old about his pension, while looking like an extra from Cocoon? It does not work. This movie is all about 'lazy' and trading on reputations. I think Pacino is a genius - I watched Carlito last night, De Niro is brilliant - I think 'Ronin' and ""I ambushed you with a coffee cup"", Dennehey has done wonderful work - the first Rambo movie for example. In this film they are assuming that nobody will notice that they are all 20 years too old. They are wrong and I find this a bit disrespectful.And all the above is before beginning to consider the plot. Which is lazy and formulaic - if you make it to the final 'twist', you will be neither surprised nor care. This film is aimed simply at the 'fan' market - those who will get excited at Pacino and De Niro in the same film together a la 'Heat'. But 'Heat' was a brilliant film, and this is but a piece of lazy self indulgent nonsense.I am not a 'fan' of any artist per se; I am a 'fan' of their serious work. If they chose to disrespect me - in the way that the three male leads here have done - I feel that I have very little choice but to disrespect them for my part.Pacino has had a dabble with Shakespeare - his Shylock was excellent, I have not seen his Richard - I would love to see him do Lear. I do not need to see him put on his leather jacket again. Not at 68. "
Gomorrah             ,dariusspini,,crime,2008,NA,"Based on Roberto Saviano's best seller ( over 1.000.000 copies sold in Italy ), this movie is an inside look at Camorra's underworld in Naples, depicted as a sort of modern Dante's Inferno. Children and young guys are involved in a merciless, cruel struggle for life and blood money which has caused over 3.600 dead so far which is a bigger slaughter than the others committed by different criminal organizations in Italy and elsewhere. Five stories from Saviano's book have been chosen and told through a few professional actors and a lot of real people that never stood in front of a camera before. A heavy, gray sky hangs over these sleazy landscapes as if the beauty of one of the Italian lands of the sun had fled and the moral darkness had taken its place.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,animation,2008,5,"I had absolutely no interest in seeing Star Wars: The Clone Wars from the first time I saw the trailer, I just couldn't believe my eyes, has George really sunk this low? It's bad enough that we had a really shaky sequel from him and director legend Steven Spielberg that brought us Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you could tell at that point already, that was more for money than for the fans. Now we have Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I remember the first time I saw the original Star Wars, I was a little girl, I watched it with my dad, now this was back in 1989 when I was 4 years old, but there was something so magical about that movie that I still enjoy watching it from time to time, and it wasn't animated. Now we have the animated Star Wars that was definitely more aimed for the little one's than the adults or die hard fans of the famous trilogy. I don't know what to say to George other than, please, don't do this, you've done so well, quit while you're ahead of the game.As the Jedi Knights prepare for the battles of the galaxy, Anakin Skywalker is assigned to train Ahsoka Tano, who wants to be a Jedi. They are both assigned to get Jabba the Hut's infant son who has been kidnapped by the Separatists who are setting the Jedi's up to make it look like they were the one's who kidnapped Jabba's son and are trying to kill him. Anakin and Ahsoka have only one chance to fix this while trying to save Jabba's son and figure a way to convince Jabba that they are not at fault, Anakin must face off with Captain Rex to regain his trust back with Jabba.Star Wars: The Clone Wars isn't by any means a bad movie, but if you are going to line it up with the other Star Wars movies, oh, yeah, it will disappoint you. Like I said, this was more for the kids, not to mention, I think George is just doing whatever he can to leak the Star Wars franchise for all it's worth. But in my opinion, I will always love to watch the three original Star Wars movies, the prequels, I did like the Syth, but like I said, the first three have that special touch that will never be matched up with any of these recent Star Wars movies, but of course if you are a die hard fan, I know you will see this, otherwise I'll say stick with a matinée or go for the rental, this was a flop compared to what it should have been, nice try, George, we didn't buy it this time.5/10"
Adoration             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,drama,2008,NA,"I'm never going to be the most unbiased observer when it comes to any given Atom Egoyan movie. He is one of my favorite directors and certainly one of the best Canadian directors currently working, and I have enjoyed every one of his films, even the much derided ""Where the Truth Lies"", which I found to be a tremendously entertaining genre piece.Still, I was concerned when news of the uninspiring critical response from Cannes came in, and even more concerned when I noticed that the film received several extremely negative reviews, some of them from critics whose tastes match mine. Having now seen ""Adoration"" at CIFF I'm not going to pretend I can't see where they're coming from- the film is a little preachy, there's bits of acting which are poor, there's a weakness to Egoyan's writing in that he seems to want to touch on every possible viewpoint on the issues being explored here within this running time, and occasionally it comes off as a little desperate.None of that keeps ""Adoration"" from being an intensely involving film, and a powerful one as well; a film about prejudices, loss, the power of technology, and the effect of fiction on reality and vice versa will always be topical, but given the actual plot of the film it is particularly relevant to today's world. ""Adoration"" revolves around Simon (played by Devon Bostick), an orphaned teenager born to a Palestinian father and a white, North American mother, who both died in a car accident when he was a child, and was raised afterwards by his uncle Tom (played brilliantly by Scott Speedman). When Simon writes a story about a terrorist who conceals a bomb inside his pregnant girlfriend's luggage before she boards a plane to Israel and imagines himself as the unborn child that is almost killed by the terrorist bomb (a story which has parallels to his racist and intolerant grandfather's version of the story of how Simon's parents died), his drama and French teacher encourages him to share it with his class, passing it off as truth. What she didn't predict was that Simon would post the story online, creating crazed debates and political agendas. The story doesn't revolve around these discussions, but rather develops from there into a character drama which grows in quality as the film moves forward. Egoyan does not necessarily hit a home run every time when it comes to his work as a director, but he has never shown incompetence or lack of ability and doesn't do so here. Egoyan's writing, on the other hand, is far more inconsistent and likely to cause issues. As mentioned earlier his writing here is somewhat problematic, but not nearly as bad as certain critics would have you believe. For one, ""Adoration"" often reminded me of discussion groups I have attended on Islamist terrorism, and the dialogue here, criticized for being artificial and even 'ridiculous' is very true to the sort of dialogue you would get out of a group interested in the topic. The only thing lacking, actually, during the chatroom scenes, was a Muslim voice, which would have only added to the dynamic and realism. Also, as heavy-handed as certain sections are here (though ""Crash"" makes this film look like the subtlest ever made, so it's not that bad), it's also a film which has a lot to say about human nature and our natural response to the environment we live in and to those surrounding us. ""Adoration"" is an effective and intelligent look at topical and relevant issues, but really shines as an examination of the nature of human thought, the results of the sort of environment which surrounds us, where hatred and prejudice is born, and ultimately as a character study of three individuals who all need to overcome events in their past by embracing and fully understanding them.8/10"
Surveillance             ,mario_c,1,crime,2008,8,"SURVEILLANCE is an intense thriller written and directed by David Lynch's daughter, Jennifer Lynch. David Lynch is the executive producer of the film. Well, I must say she inherited her father's directing qualities in my point of view, because she did an excellent job with what seems to be a very low cost production. Few resources, excellent directing job (and writing as well)! The film is intense, weird, and disturbing at parts, but it is mostly an audacious and sarcastic critic to the American police and the way some officers behave<U+0085> When they are supposed to ""protect and serve"" the common citizen they are the criminals themselves! But that's just a part of the movie, the one before the main and great twist this film has. In fact, there's an excellent twist in this movie that completely changes the plot direction. The final twist made me score it with an extra point I must say<U+0085> About the acting, there're some awesome performances: Bill Pullman (does a great job, especially after the twist); Julia Ormond; Pell James (very beautiful young actress, also does a good job); and the guys which play the local cops, especially the ones who did the patrols (they were funny as bad cops!).Definitely it's a great job by Jennifer Lynch. I score it 8/10."
Milk             ,orangeisthenewawesome,0,misc,2008,10,"I cannot think of one bad thing to say about this movie (well, maybe it was a teeny bit too long). OK, now that THAT'S out of the way, let me just say I have not seen a better movie than this in some time. It's a powerful portrait of our history. The story of Harvey Milk is amazing and told with great skill and sensitivity in this film. The performances are superb. Most notably, Sean Penn disappears into the role of Harvey Milk. He made me forget I was watching Sean Penn play a character. The supporting performances are also incredible. Hirsch, Franklin, Brolin and Luna add wonderful support to the stellar cast. But it is Gus Van Sant who ties together the talent and excellent writing into this gem of a movie. See it at least once."
The Square             ,richard-mason,0,crime,2008,5,"As one of those who saw the premiere of this film at the Sydney Film Festival, I can assure you if I was on the ""edgerton"" of my seat, it was in disbelief as implausibility piled upon implausibility until the film collapsed under their weight.The film started well, and for a while I was happy to go along with the well-worn Noir formula of the small crime that goes wrong, and all attempts to cover it up only make things worse for the illicit lovers, and the crimes get bigger and bigger. But they also get stupider and stupider, until you just feel your intelligence is being insulted. If, as bilingizard seems to be suggesting, black humour of the order of the Coen Brothers was being attempted, then I suggest some wit (other than that involving the fate of the dogs) should have been attempted. Nor do I think David Roberts was an acceptable lead. The character was dour and unpleasant from the beginning (making it hard to care what happened to him and his paramour) and the performance added no light or shade or leavenings of humanity.I agree it looks good, and the direction is stylish. But the plot is not just full of holes, but sinkholes that suddenly open up under the feet of the characters, and the audience."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,plesgaby,0,animation,2008,7,"I went to a private screening yesterday with very low expectative, but ""Clone Wars"" surprised me. Being a fan of the Star Wars franchise since childhood, I wondered what was the real need for a movie like this, set between Episodes II and III, and telling the story of a very unimportant event in the Star Wars universe. But only 5 minutes into the film, I forgot about my preconceptions and became fully absorbed with the stunning visuals and the compelling plot. ""Clone Wars"" delivers, and definitely lives up to its predecessors. The only thing that seems a little odd is the fact that the main character and hero of the story (Anakin), is the person who we already know will become the cruelest villain in sci-fi history. I hope Lucas gives us more of these films in the near future, perhaps filling the gap between Episodes III and IV."

And yes, the whole plot here is a house of cards with one lie covering up another and another until the two characters spiral downwards into a chasm of self destruction and loss of control. For our two cheating main characters, it gets a little Kafkaesque as the circle of poison and snowballing of deceit begins to collapse in on itself and destroys everyone around them.

Milk             ,marcosaguado,0,misc,2008,9,"It happened only 30 years ago but it looks and feels as if it had been much, much longer and yet we're still dealing with many of the same issues. Gus Van Sant moves slightly and respectfully to mainstream to tell us this inspiring and tragic story. Sean Penn is superb as Harvey Milk, none of the traits that made him famous are present here, other than his talent that is, he exudes a positive sweetness that is compelling and contagious. Josh Brolin as Dan White, manages the impossible by giving the assassin an unexpected but welcome humanity. James Franco as Milk's lover is, quite simply, scrumptious. As it happens with most biopics we're forced to run from event to event to be fair and accurate and ""Milk"" suffers from that. I wanted more insight into Diego Luna's character - the most problematic - and into Emile Hirsch's character but the essentials are here and the essentials must be listed in lyrical terms. History yes but also poetry. Hope as a theme. A triumph! 2"

I was very pleasantly surprised, and while it perhaps won't win any Oscars, I thought it was well acted in the main with some faces you'll recognise. It might not have massive appeal outside the UK, however it is a good (based on fact) story. I'm not a massive fan of 70's music, but it wouldn't have done any harm to have a bit more in the background just to give it more of a seventies feel about it. The general mood of the film was good and for me seemed to set the scene well, without going overboard with sex or violence. On the whole, it's well worth a visit, even if you have never lived in that era. "
The Escapist             ,Spikeopath,,crime,2009,9,"On the surface it looked like being a standard prison break out picture. But come the end one can't help admiring the construction of the film and marvel at how the makers used the cons to con the audience in a wholly satisfying way. The set-up is simple enough, Brian Cox's old lag Frank Perry is mortified to hear that his daughter is mixed up with heavy drugs and death is perhaps one more hit away from her. Desperate to get out of prison to save her, he hatches a plan for escape and enlists some other like minded souls, each with their own special ""skill"" to see it through. What follows is a twinned inter-cut tale as we witness the escape attempt and the prior motivations leading up to said escape. All building towards what one can rightly expect to be a run of the mill ending so evident in most prison based movies......Directed by Rupert Wyatt, The Escapist thrives on claustrophobic atmosphere and grim prison reality to set the wheels in motion. Filmed at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin, this is a dank place, overcrowded and paint peeling from every wall; and of course there's an array of unsavoury characters just waiting to use violence or sexual proclivities to feather their respective nest. This place alone is reason enough for escape attempts, let alone the reasons put forward for our escaping protagonists. The audio on offer also enhances the mood, the clanking of metal or the rumbling of shuffling boots land in the ear drum with almost tenacious glee. There's also no overdose on dialogue, no filler conversations serving no purpose to the crux of the tale.The cast are (prison) uniformly strong, led by the great and weathered Cox, the roll call of escapees also contains earthy Liam Cunningham, a buffed up Joseph Fiennes, a youthfully fraught Dominic Cooper and black magic gusto from Seu Jorge. While within these walls menace comes from a weaselly Steven Mackintosh and the excellently chilling Damian Lewis as nick daddy Rizza. All in all, The Escapist, if you pardon the pun, is a break out movie two fold. Not just as a story, but also in offering up something different in the genre it belongs too. Much like Brian Cox himself, The Escapist is something of a British treasure. 9/1"
Twilight             ,arnauteri,1,misc,2008,1,"The only thing I felt was right about this movie: the actors kind of resembled what the characters should have looked like.The only performance I enjoyed was Charlie. I personally always thought of Charlie as a more rounded person, but I adjusted to a slimmer version (makes sense seeing as Bella is slim...but then again all Charlie does is fish, watch T.V. and sit at the police station since there's no problems in Forks. Makes me feel like he would have a slow metabolism). I actually believed the words coming out of Charlie's mouth when he said them.I expected more out of Kristen (Bella). I figured Rob (Edward) would ruin the movie, I came prepared for that. What I did not expect was Steward's inability to complete a sentence (any one else notice how she started and interrupted her lines with a lot of scoffing and stuttering? Note the hospital scene: ""Wh- what? What...uh what are you saying? Like- wh- like what are you even saying? I don't- don't...i don't even know what you're saying"" (Neither do we Kristen) ).And Rob lived up to my extremely low expectations. He tried too hard. That's an understatement. He tried so hard that I felt the veins in my forehead about to burst. Every scene between him and Steward is awkward. Were they going for awkward? Because that's what it was. The book's charm was truly absent in this movie. Perhaps Meyer's talent and vision is something no one else can try to reproduce on screen. Alice was mediocre. She's supposed to be more bubbly. And she would have never let Bella go to prom in that blue JC Penny dress with the grandma sweater. And why is Victoria showing up at a high school prom? She's supposed to be licking her wounds and planning her next attack of revenge, not watching Edward and Bella dance!The rest of the vampires didn't get enough screen time for me to really judge them. Like I said, they looked the part. But so did the leading roles, until they opened their mouths.It's a shame that the books that I have come to love were portrayed like this. I have waited for months, checking Meyer's website daily for any new clips, interviews...anything! And it came down to me and my not happy b/f shaking our heads sadly when we should have been in complete awe.The only thin worse than this was watching Hayden Chrisensen play an emotional Anakin...Jedis don't cry, you wuss. 1"
College Road Trip             ,DarkVulcan29,1,adventure,2008,8,"Okay some of you may think of Raven Symone has someone who is not funny, and is over the top for the most part, like she is on Disney's That's So Raven(2003-2007), I'm amazed she still has a career after that. But her performance was memorable and not over the top. She plays Melaine Porter, a graduate from High School, who wants to go George Town college, but her overprotective dad police chief James Porter(the very funny Martin Lawerence) wants her to go to Northwestern, in hopes she'll be closer to home. He decides to on a College Road Trip with her, and that is all you need to hear. Raven Symone is not a truly great actress, but still manages to be entertaining, and avoids being called the worst actress ever. She and Martin Lawerence are funny together, they play off each other so well. It is also the funniest road comedy since Are We There Yet(2005)."
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,leezuckett,0,animation,2011,5,"The movie is fine; and fun for kids who are in the bug stage. I never took cartoons at face value even as a kid and I am not seeing my daughter do it either. If the flies not being perfect are what you are worrying about as opposed to the idea that flies talk than this movie is not for you. I have never met a child who could not point out a fly or an ant, or a potato bug, etc...As to the patriotism - a bit here and there doesn't hurt - we have lost our way a bit and maybe some good patriotism can help us find some pride in the good we have done, either way I doubt this movie will affect anyone all that much.

Igor             ,brc1974,0,animation,2008,1,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My kids were so excited to see this movie and it was such a flop. Halfway through the movie several people were leaving. My family does not get to go to the theater very often to watch movies and it really ticks me off to spend my hard earned money on something like this. The whole movie had a dreary feel to it. At one point a rabbit gnaws off is foot....that is about what you feel like doing by the end of the movie. I think my 8year old could come up with a better movie than this. There was really no funny parts whatsoever in this movie. Do not waste your time seeing this terrible piece of crap they call a movie.
Nights in Rodanthe             ,rogerdarlington,1,drama,2008,NA,"Terrible title for a movie that is not nearly as terrible as some critics have suggested. At a time when there are so many romantic comedies aimed at young viewers, it's no bad thing to have the occasional romantic story that eschews humour and involves characters in middle age - think something along the lines of ""Bridges Of Madison County"" (both are based on novels).The (goodlooking) stars are Richard Gere, as a doctor seeking to establish a new relationship with his estranged son in Latin America, and Diane Lane, a mother in a deeply unhappy marriage considering whether to abandon it. The (unusual) setting is the Outer Banks of North Carolina at a time of year when hurricanes are threatened. At times, it's a little silly and sentimental but still worth an evening in front of the television if not a visit to the cinema."
Twilight             ,jjsalata-1,1,misc,2008,1,** SPOILER ** This is just about the worst movie I have ever seen. If there was not so much hype about the book this movie would have went straight to DVD or the garbage. This is nothing like the book. It was almost like the screenwriter had to change absolutely everything no matter how insignificant the detail. Don't even rent this. I am so sad I just love these books. I am reading through them for the third time. Bella acting was horrible. She seemed to hate Edward more than anything. She had no emotions. Most scenes felt very awkward. Edward was not pale. Edward had no dark circles under his eyes. Edward in the sunlight AWFUL AWFUL. I can only hope they remake this. The book was way too good for this. It is just sad.
Street Kings             ,the-movie-guy,,misc,2008,8,"(Synopsis) Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves), a veteran LAPD Detective, works in a Special Vice Squad Unit in Los Angeles. Ludlow has been suffering from depression since his wife died. On top of that, his former partner, Detective Terrance Washington (Terry Crews) is murdered by two gang members. Ludlow goes on a wild and reckless quest through the mean streets of Los Angeles to track them down and get justice for Washington. Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) is Ludlow's supervisor who must keep him from going over the edge and out of the cross-hairs of Internal Affairs Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie).(My Comment) Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker were excellent in playing their parts. In the first 10 minutes, we get to see how good Ludlow is in using his guns. The movie races at such a fast pace, and it is so intense at times that you don't know who is the good guy or the bad guy. There are some great shootout scenes, and whatever you do, don't get in Ludlow's way, because he will take you out. Usually, the police have this cop culture of protecting each other. After they imply that Ludlow had something to do with the murder of Detective Washington, he begins to question his loyalty to his fellow officers, especially, when they hang him out to dry. At that point the movie gets real interesting. The only problem I had with the script was that it put the tough cop Ludlow in a gloomy mood the whole movie. I would have preferred him to be a cop with self-control and strength of mind. If you enjoy cop dramas, you will like this one, because it has so many twists and turns and back stabbing to keep you interested and wanting more. You will love some of Ludlow's interrogation techniques of the bad guys. (Fox Searchlight, Run Time 1:49, Rated R)(8/10) 1"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,chapsmack,0,crime,2009,NA,"Nicely done. I am glad I picked this one out. Kind of movie you'd like to watch on a lazy moody afternoon. It will perk up your interest and will get you ready for the evening! Trust me you won't get bogged down! The film is set in a bleak Fargoesque landscape and begins to build up slowly. I found a couple of situations in the plot that could be a bit far-fetched and probably could have been done better but this doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. Even with a low budget the director has come up with a remarkable suspenseful and to an extent, a film with a moral. So go on, get some pop-corn on and get settled in your favorite spot. Go out for a beer later - preferably the local beer joint!"
Iron Man             ,Joejoesan,0,action,2008,8,"From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! But of course his bubble bursts when Stark is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to reproduce his killing missile, the Jericho. The sacrifice of a fellow scientist makes him humble and after his spectacular escape Stark decides to better his life. No more manufacturing of weapons for Stark Industries. From now on Stark wants to help his fellow men. Although this decision impresses some (like Stark's secretary Paltrow) it also infuriates others (like Stark's partner Jeff Bridges). This all leads to a action-packed finale in which Iron Man must face a deadly enemy...Iron Man is the big Robert Downey Jr. show. Downey not only brings humor and flamboyance to his role, he also manages to make you believe that an egocentric person can indeed change into a real humanitarian. The scene in which he realizes that someone is willing to make a sacrifice in order for him to escape is even a moving one. Well done. Downey is really a great actor with great charisma.But there is a lot more to Iron Man. There are four or five big action scenes. The first four are so great (the escape from the cave and a sequence involving an Afghan village) that the last one - the big finale - disappoints a little bit. But that's okay. There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Jeff Bridges is always great to look at, although his role could have been played by several other actors. Maybe his storyline is the weakest of the film. His betrayal is no surprise, but his early involvement in this is hard to believe. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Hopefully it will do very well at the box office, because I can't wait to see Iron Man 2. Enjoy!PS: no Samuel Jackson in this version either!8,5 out of 10 "
Yes Man             ,Davide74,0,comedy,2008,7,"I always get excited about a new Jim Carrey movie. In my opinion, he has rarely done anything unwatchable in whatever genre from The Mask to Liar Liar via Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Yes Man is an excellent feel-good comedy with an outstanding turn from Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel & Terence Stamp. The movie is unfortunately predictable (like most Jim Carey flicks) but very enjoyable with a hard-to-ignore message about how people should live their lives. Don't be surprised after seeing the film to start saying yes a bit more often and how much of a difference it may have on your daily life. Yes Man is a worthy addition to Jim Carrey's filmography."
Changeling             ,alexkolokotronis,1,misc,2008,7,"With Changeling Clint Eastwood has yet to end his streak of auspicious film making. Though not one of his best it is certainly worth watching. Changeling is a film about a single mother's (Christine) search for her son with a twist. Rather than the LAPD trying to help her they oppose her. As a result of receiving bad publicity for being unable to find her son Walter after five months, the police deliver Christine her ""son"". He is not really her son, he is a fraud. Christine immediately recognizes the boy isn't her son and quickly points this out to the police. She realizes she now has to fight the LAPD in order to find out the truth about her son. But with her attempt to fight back and embarrass the LAPD comes intense consequences. The acting was rather disappointing in some aspects. For example Jeffrey Donovan was a bit annoying in his role as Captain Jones. His role required him to have some sort of a powerful aura with an intimidation power. Yet to me he was average bringing nothing to the movie not properly portraying a selfish unjust policeman. The star of the movie, Angelina Jolie, was very solid but her performance was not a unique or impossible one to take on by any other actress. She did what she had to do to make the movie a success but she certainly did not take the movie to another level. The one actor that did impress me though was John Malkovich which probably shouldn't be a surprise who i felt should have received more screen time. Unlike Jolie he took the movie to another level. A more serious, suspenseful and intensified level that carried a heightened sense of depth which was was badly missing from a few performances such as Jeffrey Donovan throughout the film. Overall the performances throughout were inconsistent. The writing and director of the movie was done very well but it could've used a little more sharpness. At times the movie seemed to be all over place not quite having an identity. Sometimes it was a crime mystery, sometimes a drama, and sometimes it tried too hard to be both. Despite that Clint Eastwood some how keeps Changeling from dramatically falling apart. It almost seems as if Clint Eastwood couldn't make a bad movie even if he tried. At times it flourished and at other times it just didn't feel right. Christine Collins always told her son ""You never start a fight but you always finish it."" Eastwoods job on this movies seemed quite the contrary, he never quite finished the movie off. My rating: 7.7/10"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,giantpanther,1,misc,2009,8,"I liked this film primarily of how much it seemed to buck the formulaic American plot system. Don't get me wrong some American movies are cool, but they mostly all adhere to the same boring standards.This film was incredibly bleak and honest, which I respected very much. Also it required that you think for yourself and develop your own opinions.The plot revolves around a group of young people who go out to try to make a difference and yet don't really accomplish anything at all. I can't give away too much but I thought this was just beautiful and complex film-making. Very intelligent, it never tried to be cute or force any ideas on you, it simply was.I know this is a vague review, but if you feel like seeing an intelligent complex drama then you must see this.

The Merry Gentleman             ,bob-rutzel-1,,crime,2009,7,"Frank Logan (Keaton) is a hit man and he suspects Kate (MacDonald) can place him at the scene of his last hit. This is slow moving, but if you look at it as a cat and mouse game it's a non-issue. The thing that really saves this movie is Kate's Scottish accent. You cannot get enough of it regardless or what else is going on. Okay, the movie would save itself anyway, but when Kate speaks, you listen because you really don't know anything about her, and that accent is pure heaven. Maybe it is the accent. The title is somewhat misleading. There is nothing merry about Frank Logan as you will see. Merry is used because it is Christmas time and he does act the part of a gentleman. See? Seems it is all a matter of some misdirection, but only in the title, not in the story. This is Michael Keaton's first attempt at directing and since I enjoyed the movie, I'd say he did a good job of it. He brought the right amount of suspense and tension throughout the story. And, to have selected Kelly MacDonald to play Kate, with that accent is pure genius. I guess you can tell I really like the Scottish accent. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, som"
Bolt             ,NightBiker,0,animation,2008,10,"Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well. 1"
Quarantine             ,rexhorwood,1,horror,2008,1,"Unfortunately I could not give the film a minus score - it deserves minus 10 - it is not worth watching.The main presumption in the movie is that all those who lived in the apartments were completely stupid and so were tho police and firemen who came to help them. The fact that there was a vet in the apartment block who did not spot rabies until 30 plus minutes after I did points to the totally unrealistic plot and the ignorance of the director who wrote it. It was obvious from the moment the first woman the paramedics saw was foaming at the mouth. That was an immediate warning to quarantine the building, not group everybody together. The police would not have approached but used a taser gun to immobilise her before sedating and securing her. Then we had the doctors wearing bio-hazard suits. They would have only gone inside in force and to take sedated patients out into secure quarantine cubicles. They knew it was rabies and would have isolated all the individuals. Any further search of the building would be with high powered guns.We all know that the people in Hollywood are not the brightest or smartest of men/women, and this film goes to prove it. In my view the most important factor in a good film is the plot and if this is totally ludicrous and unrealistic the whole tenet of the film fails. It insults anyone with intelligence and obviously you cannot connect with any character in a film where they are all completely stupid.Obviously it is aimed at those with a low IQ."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,dcandido,0,animation,2008,7,"I thought that the first Madagascar had promising characters and a decent premise, but it was very poorly put together. My son, who was 8 or 9 at the time loved the movie, however. We saw the sequel this morning and we both agreed - it was much better than the original. And, since part II begins with a brief summary of part I, there is no need to see the first one to understand what's happening in the new movie. All the main characters are back and there are many new ones as well. Going in, the big question on my mind was ""do the penguins play a bigger role in the sequel?""... answer is ""Yes, but not much bigger"". All in all an enjoyable movie that outshines it's predecessor! "
The Square             ,BOUF,0,crime,2008,5,"After about a minute into this plotty thriller, the male lead looks like he knows he's doomed. He continues to look like he knows he's doomed until the end, just after a rather silly shoot-out, which made several audience members snigger. I wanted to enjoy this Aussie movie, but I wasn't at all interested in the mostly two-dimensional characters, whom I felt, were being pushed along by a slightly heavy-handed plot, which did little to illuminate them further, or tell us anything interesting. Well, there were a couple of thrills, and some nice little mysteries and tension, but there was also a lot of predictable TV plodding and some casting of hams who are throwback to the 1970s. There is a very nice tense scene between Anthony Hayes and Damon Herriman, who acquit themselves particularly well; whereas some of the actors could have benefited from a more dramatically imaginative directorial hand. Generally: it's all competent, but just not very interesting"

The dialog was hilariously awful, The characters are very unlikable, the ""Jump"" moments didn't even phase me. And I hated how they tried so hard to make the whole feel of the film creepy and scary(Hence the 'Scary music').It takes brains to make a good horror movie, and this one has no brains at all. It looks like were not going to be able to fight off any stupid remakes or boring horror movies anytime soon...

Pride and Glory             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,,crime,2008,7,"Edward Norton and Colin Ferrell, the automatic great duo, they make a perfect team for a movie like this. They're both great actors and will make any movie worth the watch. So my friends and I watched Pride and Glory a little over a week ago, I was hearing mixed reviews on it, but still, when you love these actors as much as I do, you have to see it. So based on my honest opinion, this is a very good story, but the film just needed better editing, it was a little longer than it should have been. Also I didn't really like the ending, although I know they did it more for the cinematic reasons as people wanna see the bad guys pay for their crimes. But Ed, Colin, and even John Voight make this film very watchable and click right on screen. We've seen a million crooked cop movies, I think we're still looking for one that really stands out, but Pride and Glory holds itself well and is watchable.Jimmy is a narc who does pretty much all the dirty work when it comes to busting in on drug dealers, hookers, murderers, rapists, etc. One night though he among other cops receive a call that 4 policemen have been killed in a building with drug dealers. Jimmy is trying to figure out what went wrong only to find out that one of the drug dealers had an inside man who called in advance to warn them that the cops were coming. But one of the policemen that he suspects is his brother in-law who does the best he can to justify all that he is doing.Pride and Glory is a very good story, I'd say though to wait for the rental, but I'm warning you there are some really intense scenes, Colin goes really far in one scene with a baby, I'm a person who has seen every disturbing film known to man, and this scene had my hands over my eyes. If you wanna see this film, you'll see what I'm talking about. There are some shocking lines as well and hurtful, this was just an intense movie and is not for the weak hearted. It's like the more disturbing episode of The Shield in some ways. Ed and Colin work well together and are a great duo, Pride and Glory is a good movie, just needs a little more editing.7/10"
The Merry Gentleman             ,MartinHafer,,crime,2018,6,"No captions'flat affectunsatisfying ending""The Merry Gentleman"" is a very strange film. It also is a very unsatisfying one because I liked so much of it and the film's ending really did not deliver.The film is about an unlikely friendship that develops between a suicidal assassin (Michael Keaton) and a woman, Kate (Kelly MacDonald), who has been abused by her partner. What links them is tenuous and the ending really, really not at all what I'd hoped. This is a real shame, as the movie, up until that point, has terrific and highly original. It also never really delved into Keaton's character well enough. His motivation, in particular, is confusing to say the least.Overall, had the ending been better, this would have been an excellent film.

The Duchess             ,moutonbear25,1,misc,2008,9,"It seems that with each passing year, there comes a point in time when we will inevitably find the young and beautiful, Keira Knightly, in yet another period drama. It also seems like every period drama these days, whether it features Knightly or not, feels the need to disassociate itself from the conventions of the past and assert itself as fresh, with a unique twist on the genre. This is particularly challenging when the story is one we've seen a number of times prior. The true story of Georgina Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, as told by director, Saul Dibb, in THE DUCHESS, is one where a young girl of ""modest"" heritage is married off to an esteemed Duke for a price. Her duty is to serve his grace and provide to him a male heir. As a woman, she is nothing more than a decorative commodity and should she not be able to fulfill her wifely promises, then she is essentially useless. Dibb is smart about it though. With the point already made before the film even begins, he chooses to focus instead on the reality of this kind of imprisonment <U+0096> what it feels like for a girl beneath her binding bodice.Knightly carries the weight of this film on her shoulders while carrying the weight of the wigs on her head with poise and prominence. Her big brown eyes go from playful to shy to distraught and defeated. When we first meet her, she is free and seemingly unaware of the heavier world outside of her backyard games. Before long though, she is face to face with adulthood. This particular face belongs to Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire. It is here that Dibb steps in to add another layer to the played out trajectory. With an age difference that is only matched in vastness by the distance between them, the Duke undresses his Duchess and asks why women's clothing must be so complicated. There is no better occasion for small talk than before two practical strangers go to bed for the first time. Knightly, trying desperately to hide her nervousness, replies to the obviously rhetorical question though, claiming that this is the only way for women to express themselves in the times they live in. It is clear she is not sure that a reply is necessary or even allowed but it is also clear that she speaks to ensure that she is seen, that her person is present. Her clothing falls to the floor and the imprints of her corset can still be seen on the smooth of her back.Dibb follows this form of unexpected intimacy and insight with commentary about celebrity and how little the adoring public truly knows about their icons. The Duchess of Devonshire, or at least the one in THE DUCHESS, was an immense influence on her people. Her presence at events guaranteed crowds while her fashion determined the trends. Even her association with particular people could sway public and political opinion. She embodied grace and extravagance while remaining humble and the public ate it up. In their eyes, her life was perfect but those who traveled in closer circles knew better. They knew that there was little love between the Duke and Duchess and increased strain as she was not able to provide a male heir. Even they didn't know just how bad it was though. The wait staff on the other hand could have made millions on a tell-all. Like Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, Dibb shows us what goes on on both sides of the castle gates, highlighting the drastic disconnect between the two close worlds. The Duchess was made to make many horrific choices and concessions that would have broken many a lesser person. What makes them so harrowing in the context of the film is the plainness with which they are expected by the Duke and subsequently accepted by all involved.THE DUCHESS is shocking on many levels. It is shocking how harsh it is underneath its polished finish and how new this old tale feels. It is shocking how well Knightly can hold her pain and her own. And it is shocking how little value and worth was once afforded the women of the world. But it is perhaps most shocking that the manner in which women were once seen as a male possession, with purpose and function that only serves the male agenda, still exists today, no matter how you dress it up"
The Escapist             ,johngregory07,,crime,2008,10,"Truly superb film. I was impressed by the choice of actors, some of whom played characters that one wouldn't expect them to do so well in - Damian Lewis, in particular, really impressed with his performance as 'the bad guy', while Steven Mackintosh also does an impressive job of scaring the living daylights out of you in this film.The sound design and parts of the music really help the film along, building the pace at the right moments, creating suspense and capturing the raw, gritty feeling of prison life perfectly. It was a delight getting so involved in the subtleties of a film's soundtrack - something that is lacking in modern day feature films.This film should stand out far more than other films of this genre, it is award-winning material."
Yes Man             ,LazySod,0,comedy,2009,7,"Meet Carl. Carl leads a life on his own. Somewhat miserable because he's always stuck with himself. Carl denies himself all the pleasures of life because he's unable to accept them. With each and every new opportunity arising he turns it down with a firm NO. Luckily for Carl he has a friend, a friend that pulls him along to a seminar where Carl is introduced to the power of Yes. Converted by the power of Yes Carl is now ready to accept life's challenges and chances, saying Yes to every single one of them.And so the film starts running and shooting gags concerning each of the accepted chances and the very most of them work out pretty well. Carrey is on a roll playing the plagued Carl that has to swallow down quite a few odd things during his days of the all-accepter. The pace of the film comes to its final speed when Carl runs into Allison though, who I guess can be considered his final and most challenging opportunity. It works out flawlessly - Deschanel plays her brilliantly and the two characters together work out more than well enough.The story line plays by rather predictable, but that's fine. It's no big mystery of life that is being challenged here after all. And when the film finally comes to its end all it can do is leave a smile on the face of the audience - time to say Yes and accept that life can be a swell place after all.7 out of 10 opportunities tak"
Hancock             ,KoondoggSaints,0,action,2008,7,"I was lucky enough to go to a pre-screening of Hancock last night and I really enjoyed it. I don't understand all of the criticism this movie is receiving. Everyone take a second and realize this is not a Marvel or DC comic book superhero movie. Now think about that again. It is a different story entirely and has some very unique elements.Hancock isn't action packed. It doesn't have a Superhero vs. Supervillan plot. I would probably describe it as a character study of the superhero. I think this movie does a better job of addressing some of the issues (and vices) a superhero probably would have if they existed today. The biggest conflict in the movie is within Will Smith's character's attitude, not necessarily good vs. evil.I think much of the criticism I have read about is motivated by expectations that were not met, which isn't fair at all. If you watch Hancock with only the expectation of being entertained, you will leave happy. Its a good movie, don't jump on the bandwagon of not liking it just because you can. Give it a chance and take it for what it is, a July 4th action/comedy. 3"
The Square             ,Hellmant,0,crime,2010,7,"'THE SQUARE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Intrigued by Harry Knowles (popular film critic for 'Ain't It Cool News') promise that this is ""One of the best films of the year. The best film noir since 'BODY HEAT'"" (Which is plastered all over the DVD case) I decided to check out this low budget Australian thriller. It's directed by Nash Edgerton and written by his brother Joel, with some help from Matthew Dabner. The Edgerton brothers have a diverse range of film experience from stunts (Nash is well known in Australia for this) to editing to acting (Joel played Owen Lars in 'STAR WARS: EPISODE II' and 'III'). This is the brothers first feature together in which they're writer and director (Joel also has a decent sized acting role in the film). While I don't think it's one of the very best films of the year or the best film noir since 'BODY HEAT' (I sometimes agree with Knowles and sometimes don't) I do think it's a very well made and entertaining film, especially for such a low budget one.Experienced character actor David Roberts stars as Raymond Yale, a construction worker who's become bored with marriage and has started a heated affair with the young hairdresser Carla (played by the beautiful Claire van der Boom) who lives next door. Carla has recently discovered a blood stained bag filled with money hidden in her home by her criminal husband Greg (played by Anthony Hayes). She talks the reluctant Raymond into helping her stealing it by burning down their home and with it the apparent bag of money but things of course don't go as planned. Greg becomes aware that the money wasn't in the house and the two lovers become entangled in much bigger crimes as things get worse and worse.The film takes one depressing twist after another and the hero digs himself even deeper and deeper into trouble which leaves the viewer kind of mad. In a lot of film noir this is the point but in this film the events that take place are so ridiculously over the top and unbelievable that the film doesn't quite work on the level it should. It's still a beautifully moody and well acted film and like I said impressive for such a low budget one. Despite the film's fall from reality I still found myself wrapped up in the characters and really wanted things to work out for them. Be warned this movie is pretty gloomy and depressing but due to it's mild foray into campy-ness it's also darkly comedic. Not a great film but a well made and memorable one all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8w-4xZ94"
Ghost Town             ,postmanvendetta,0,misc,2008,8,"I came into this film not expecting much, I loved the office and extras but never really thought of Ricky Gervais as a feature length actor considering his pretty much repetitive role as a character that is a magnet to awkwardness. I was correct in the sense that he played this character however what surprised me was the premise and narrative of the film completely complemented this role... weird considering he didn't even write it.However not indulging on this idea the film was made for Gervais all I can say what a great little movie! The acting was solid, but what impressed me most was the was it went from being a comedy to a very moving rom-com that speaks in a non self preachy way how much better the world would be if people realised that everybody suffers the downs of life not just themselves.A perfect example of this without spoiling too much is when Gervais helps one of the ghosts return a cherished stuffed toy to his son. On returning the stuffed toy Gervais then realises that the mother of the boy is the chatty woman he is always shutting up at the dentist. Which highlights Gervais's failure at the start of the film to realise other peoples pains but is now redeemed thanks to his interaction with the ghosts thus making him a fulfilled and much better person. It is almost the Christmas Carroll of the 21st century albeit a funnier and much light hearted one. But more importantly it was a pleasant surprise on what has been a bad year for comedy 'cough' love guru 'cough'. YN"
Death Race             ,goalieboy45,0,action,2008,9,"I went into Death Race with really no idea what to expect from it. I am a big fan of Jason Statham movies but the concept of this movie hadn't really made me too excited to see it. Nevertheless this is a great movie, the humor is spot on throughout the movie, though this is definitely no comedy. The action is fast paced throughout and they come up with some pretty creative ways for characters to get killed. I found the story to obviously be a bit far fetched with it being people racing in a prison and all but never that didn't ruin the movie at all and I ended up loving the storyline. Overall, the acting was great, and it had great effects and a good storyline. I consider this a must watch for those who love action movies. 9/10 "
Twilight             ,pyrocitor,1,misc,2008,4,"After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels. Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film. However, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the ""Harry Potter syndrome"", feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow. But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary. The film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his ""sultry, moody glances"" delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through ""stern but absent father"" clichés to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob. While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to cliché and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy. -4/10 1"
Kisses             ,jneedleman,1,drama,2014,NA,"Non-narrative films can be great, but this is something different. *Kisses* has enough plot and complications for anyone. Every thread is resolved, every theme revisited in this study of the beauty and terror of adolescents tasting freedom. This is one of those films in which painstakingly localized settings and characterization achieve the universal.I kept thinking of a line from Dennis Cooper while watching this: ""And when they kiss, it's so cold and impressive to them."" Yes, the kisses in this film are impressive to the characters, but there's nothing cold about them. They always seem to a seal a bond as warm as the sun. And though there's desperation and insecurity, the characters hold back and compensate as they would in real life. There are things we tell ourselves not to show until at last they show without our permission.Danger and wonder are everywhere, yet the tone deftly avoids the sentimental even when the structure employs techniques from classic melodrama.There are moments of joy in *Kisses* in which everything stops, like musical numbers without singing. And the use of color makes you wonder if it's the cinematography that's stunning or simply the world itsel"
Garden Party             ,testacorsa,1,drama,2009,NA,"Well, it's my first comment here on IMDb, but since this movie only had two comments before mine, one of them rating it perfect and the other one below average, I thought mine would make sense.First of, I really liked the semi slow-flowing pace this film had. It kept me entertained the whole way through, and I was excited to see what happened next.Eash characters little story holds dilemmas, and situations we can understand and relate to. While the storyline isn't heading anywhere in particular, it takes you through a short period of time in the character's life. I like this style, and when this is done well, I find I don't long for a big climaxes, or an ending where everything comes together.Sadly there is a lack of depth in the characters. The stereotype characters work very well, but we aren't allowed to look much further below the surface. The perspective is always from the outside as a spectator, which makes the few reactions and emotions seem pretty superficial and hollow.This movie could have been much more! A bit more manuscript development, and it would have been up there.So all in all: This is not a masterpiece, and not a movie I will remember, but a good hour and a half's entertainment well worth watching."
Nights in Rodanthe             ,osmith-9,1,drama,2008,7,"Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. Both, also, are searching for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can help heal each other. There were aspects of the film that I wished I'd seen play out more-- where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on, such as the apology to the bereaved widower, and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with Paul to feeling okay with it soon after. An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming. But in the end, the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears. So, I have to say it is well worth viewin"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,gundaforlife,0,misc,2008,1,"I consider myself somewhat of a amateur movie critic and at the same time a casual movie watcher because cinematography,direction,and all technicalities aside...a movie has to be plain entertaining first and then we can judge it on its other merits.How a movie can be so offensive,repulsive and at the same time,not a least bit entertaining,is absolutely amazing.Okay...Lets make a summary of good points... 1.It got over quickly. 2.It got over quickly 3.It got over quickly!!A ten year old would have done a better job making this insipid mess of a movie.Cringe worthy dialogues which i have heard in a million movies before this,uttered so flatly you are kept wondering if they were written by someone on drugs while watching dvds of all the 'inspirational' movies of all the ages,probably the worst chemistry i have seen in a lead couple in a movie where good chemistry is primary,and in all honesty not too many breath taking dance sequences to make it even a little worth your while.This horribly written and directed excuse of a movie is strictly for the connoisseurs....OF CRAP!Kindly replay 'Dirty Dancing' again!Do Not Watch!"
35 Shots of Rum             ,incitatus-org,0,drama,2009,NA,"The quiet Lionel (played by the cool Alex Descas) lives with his grown up daughter Joséphine (newcomer Mati Diop) in a comfortable, albeit somewhat sterile, grey, contemporary apartment in a Parisian suburb. Life has unfortunately taken away Lionel's wife, and left the two-person family in a state of tranquil solitude, where the father and daughter lean on each other in the big wide world. This outside world is there, as their entourage, but they keep it at bay. Lionel knows they can not continue living like that indefinitely, and one day he will have to let his daughter go, to live her own life, but silently he hopes that that day will be far off. When their upstairs neighbour Noé, who has always been there, announces that he will leave, Joséphine gets angry. It is at that moment that she too realises that the world around her can not be forever frozen. It is time to look ahead.The small family is running on a borrowed time, but happy to be together while they still can. They are compared to Gabrielle, the family friend, who lives in hope and the afore mentioned neighbour Noé, who lives, disorientated, in painful past of his parents' death. Both of them cling to Lionel and Joséphine for their stability, for the calm love they share. As a viewer, you can not help but feel that Lionel ""should"" be living with Gabrielle and Joséphine with Noé, as that would be a more natural state than a grown-up girl living with her father. But of course, there are no rules to who who should be living with who. Or are there? When Lionel and Joséphine look to their future, what do they see? This in between state, at the end of the close-knit family life and the starting of your own, is the playing field of the film. 35 Rhums, is a very slow movie with a close attention to detail, reminiscent of Claire Denis' Vendredi Soir. We see what is going on, through the actions of the characters, leaving very little to be said. The consequence of such an approach is that you have to slow down the pace, to allow the audience time to take in those details. There lies the risk, and although I was taken in by characters, the ""normal"" gestures or running of the train through the urban landscape scenes are a little too customary to warrant such an exposure. Whether or not this will bother you is hard to judge, but you will need to be a bit indulgent.Racially, the movie is quite a curiosity. Lionel is black and his wife was white so their daughter, evidently, is métis. So far all is normal. Joséphine's love interest and upstairs neighbour Noé is white. The family friend Gabrielle looks Caribbean. Still fine. Then we get to see his colleagues at the railways, the SNCF, and they are all black! Is there an SNCF line which hires only staff of African or Caribbean descent? Not very likely. And then there is Joséphine's university: the professor and all the students are black! Not even at the university of Martinique, where most people are black, is it an easy feat to write yourself in for a course where not a single white or other raced student has written himself in. What is the point of this bizarre image? Even if they were part of some community (e.g. Caribbean), then that would make more sense showing it in opposition to another French community (say mainstream or Chinese) rather then an artificial submersion. But they are not part of a subculture (no more than their own individuality) nor are the SNCF colleagues or the students. It is a strange touch which is unrealistic and seemingly without purpose.Overall 35 Rhums is a carefully crafted film well worth its time, despite its weaknesses. Make sure you are not tired when you go it, to be able to take in the rhythm, as you are taken along the tracks in the Parisian behind-the-scenes. Lionel and Joséphine will linger with you long after the lights are back on."

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,lvscott,0,action,2008,7,"I believe the reason a few people are saying this film is really bad is because allot of people want that ""film Magic"" of the first film in this series, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". What people fail to realize is that at the time, that film was one of a kind for the time, a new roller coaster ride for many of us when we were younger.No film will ever quite match it, including any film with the main character of ""Indiana Jones"".. Having said that, this film here is fun enough on it's own merits. Of course, it is not a great film, but it is entertaining..My criticisms;I could of done without what I consider to be ""Alien Propaganda"" that seems to plaugue allot of Spielbergs directed films.The new characters could of been fleshed out more.Spielberg should of kept his word, and used allot less CGI, he didn't. In fact, everything he has represented about this film before it's release has frankly been flat out FALSE!! The story could of been better, but it is not bad.My likes; Harrison Ford still has it, He looks Great, and got back into the character of Indiana Jones quite well.The pacing was good and about the same as Raiders in that regard.Nice to see Karen Allen again on the screen. I always liked her as an actress.final verdict.Worth a viewing, but DO NOT EXPECT the same magic that Raiders had, or you will end up like many here, HATING IT!! 3"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,nico_nasr,1,misc,2008,6,"I went to see that movies in theaters as both my sisters asked me to go. I wasn't thrilled but since I had nothing to do I went.There was around 200 people in the theater...195 girls and 5 guys. I would've thought more couples would be there but apparently, guys really didn't want to see that movie so my first thought was : ""Uh oh! I'm in for a long evening!"".Well I wasn't! Of course, staring at 4 beautiful girls is hardly a waste of my time but I found myself laughing many times and was intrigued by the movie.The story is simple. The same pair of jeans comes again as in the first movie. All the 4 girls are again separated during the summer. Lena is in Long Island in some sort of art class, Tibby is in New York for her movie, Bridget is in Turkey doing archeology and Carmen is in Vermont doing backstage work in a play.Well I won't say anything but you know the sort of things that happen. Well they happen. And it's good, it's your average teen movie, nothing exceptionally genius but nothing bad either.I heard lots of complaints about some loose ends but that's not really true. Maybe people didn't listen enough or didn't quite understand what wasn't said but overall, everything fell right into place.So why go see an average teen movie you might ask? Well I ask myself that question every day. I guess I like to be entertained and those 4 girls make that happen.You probably shouldn't waste your money on going to see it in theaters but you should definitely rent it when it's out on DVD.So in resume, it's as good as the first one...and Tibby is hilarious!"
Ponyo             ,tinulthin,1,animation,2008,8,"Gake no Ue no Ponyo is like something you might get if you mashed My Neighbour Totoro into The Little Mermaid, then put the entire project in the hands of a five-year-old animation prodigy. The film is simultaneously stunning in its beauty and endearing in its simplicity, unrestrained enthusiasm walking the edge between inspired brilliance and mind-addling delirium.In the opening sequences, literally thousands of individually animated fish swirl across the screen<U+0097>a task Western animators wouldn't touch without a room full of computers. And yet the film's omnipresent water is defined by hard lines that seem to have been drawn in with crayons and coloured by pastels. In style and content, this is clearly a children's fantasy, and yet it isn't.Remarkably, Miyazaki has yet again achieved what he created in Totoro: a film that draws the viewer indelibly into the world of children, reminding us of the time when every discovery was unique, every possession precious, and the agony of loss crouched behind every well-meaning mistake. Perhaps this is why the film has appealed more to adults than to children in Japan: children still live in this world. They need no such reminders.Sousuke, a five-year-old who retrieves the eponymous Ponyo from the ocean, is not another Pinocchio-like screen caricature. He is a real boy. He is intelligent yet careless, deeply conscientious but distracted by impulse. He grounds us in a world that wavers between the real and the surreal.Wide-eyed wizard Fujimoto, voiced with narcoleptic mania by comedian Tokoro Joji, is by far the most rational of the film's fantastical creations. He's an oddball, but he makes sense. But when waves begin to lap at the doorstep to Sousuke's hilltop home and the townsfolk jovially pile into rowboats to scud over a swollen sea of prehistoric fish, we begin to wonder whether this is the real world or some beatific daydream. Miyazaki draws no clear distinction.Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a children's love story, driven with monomaniacal ferocity by Ponyo and Sousuke's pure mutual affection. Composer Joe Hisaishi underscores this intensity, calling up mighty swells of strings to accompany Ponyo's first ascent to the surface, and later evoking Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries in a stunning sequence where Ponyo chases down a speeding car while running atop a cascading tsunami of gigantic fish.While the film loses much of its energy<U+0097>though none of its eccentricity<U+0097>in the final act, Miyazaki has nonetheless succeeded in creating yet another modern fairy tale. It is a simple, pure vision, guilelessly washed across with a devoted kindergartener's finger paints. 1"
Adoration             ,edwardtom9,0,drama,2010,3,"i'm gonna try and keep this review short, Basically i found this film pretty terrible, it tries too hard to be arty and symbolic but only comes off as pretentious and feels fake, who burns their phone to forget a video on it, there's a delete button hahaha.But in all seriousness, the music suited the film but was pretentious along with the film, the acting was really the only redeeming feature for me, i thought they did the best they could with the material they had at their disposal, however the story was poorly written and tried to be very symbolic which it pulled off to some extent, but a lot of the symbolism was unnecessary and as i said earlier tried too hard.Overall i think the acting was OK the rest was pretty terrible, and as i've stated before i believe that the attempt to be arty and meaningful just resulted in a cheesy, melodramatic and pretentious film"
Kung Fu Panda             ,honorhorror,0,animation,2008,9,"Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.As the tag line says, ""Prepare for awesomeness."" Even after so many positive comments, I still have no idea what the movie will come out like. One reason I couldn't figure out what the movie will be about is the super-simple title. Will it be just another Forbidden Kingdom? Or another Mulan? Or will it even turns out to be another Bulletproof Monk, which is among the disgraces to the Chinese culture? Sorry about this but I've seen too many movies portraying Chinese culture too superficial, which assumes Chinese philosophy established on either Buddhism(usually fake Buddhism) or some ridiculous superstition. So first of all, I am glad to say Kung fu Panda is the first Hollywood-made Chinese movie ever to make me feel proud for my ancestors' culture. If I haven't guessed it wrong, the writers really took some time digesting Chinese philosophies like the relationship between ""Beings"" and ""none-beings"", and other basic Chinese ideas about life and faith. No matter how old you are, the movie will make think for some time. It discussed some deep topics about human desire, confidence and destiny. After seeing it, I sincerely think that human desire can be used for good, for our bodies are like super-advanced machines and if you manage it in the right way, it won't be harder than controlling machines. Ancient Chinese assimilated so many nutrition from nature that they have a vision to achieve a balance between everything, that is also a reminding to me as a Chinese, which makes me proud.The visual style of the movie completely beat my expectations. Everything is animated in a Chinese paper art style and the color red is so widely used as the main theme color. It touched me deeply because it reminded me of the glorious days of Chinese cartoons. It's like a combination of Matrix and traditional kung fu movies.For many obvious reasons, it has the potential to win the Oscar. I am looking forward to some better cartoons this year. But at the same time I want Kongfu Panda to be the best animated feature of the year.9/10 Almost excellent."
Bedtime Stories             ,DICK STEEL,0,adventure,2008,7,"At first glance from the trailer, I thought this would be somewhat as insipid as 2006's Night At The Museum, where Ben Stiller had to dumb it down to provide for mass entertainment with Safe written all over it because 'tis the season of good tidings and such. But as it turned out, Adam Sandler proved to have struck some gold with this Disney offering, and I thought it was successfully refreshing for a change after his vulgar outing as Israeli counter-terrorist operative Zohan Dvir.Sandler stars as a hotel maintenance man Skeeter Bronson, whose father Marty (Jonathan Pryce) had to sell their family hotel to Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) to stave off bankruptcy. As a verbal clause, Barry promised to have let Skeeter run the hotel in the future, but as it turns out, maintenance is the department that Skeeter's stuck in instead. And things don't turn out all the more better in his life, where rival Kendall (Guy Pearce) gets slated to take over a new hotel since he's dating the boss's daughter Violet (Teresa Palmer), while Skeeter's sister Wendy (Courteney Cox) has to get out of town and dumps her two children Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) and Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) for him and her friend Jill (Keri Russell) to babysit.Hold on, didn't I just name drop a lot? You bet! Part of the fun in this movie are the familiar faces that pop up now and then. I had always associated Guy Pearce with more serious roles, and watching him ham it up here (his Broadway number especially) was something quite fun. Keri Russell continues to show that she ages with grace and Courteney Cox didn't lag any far behind too. We also have Russell Brand whom we know as the Brit rock singer in Forgetting Sarah Marshall star as yet another clueless slacker friend of Skeeter's, while Xena fans will lap at their star Lucy Lawless' supporting role here, and quite unrecognizable too with her bob hairdo.And that's not all! Imagine having Carmen Electra in a cameo, together with Rob Schneider and I thought I spied Will Farrell too (I could be wrong with his uncredited blink and you miss appearance though) as they lend support to this Happy Madison co-production, as they always do the previously produced films. But what I felt had held the movie together, aside from that impossibly bug-eyed looking guinea pig, were the two kids Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling. They are Cute personified, and in all earnestness, just as how Sandler's Skeeter echoed, one cannot fathom how anyone would bear to abandon them, or as far as Wendy's upbringing is concerned, made them lose out on the fun things in life. I'd cuddle them, seriously (while at the same time try and get them to spin tales that go my way, haha!)The two kids carry the show really well, and as the story goes, they have this inexplicable ability to make their version of the bedtime stories come true to life, while not exactly always in verbatim fashion. So while Skeeter thought he had figured things out, he tries to manipulate them so that they continue his stories which skew to his advantage, but of course this being a comedy, always end up in situations that provide fuel for laughter. And the production values don't come cheap too, as we have stories brought to life from medieval times, the wild wild west, outer space as well as in Ancient Rome, but always mirroring their real life counterparts and situations that Skeeter so decides. No effort was spared in making these stories as zany as they can be, but always kid safe.There are some nice messages to impart, moral values if you wish, in what you could expect from a Disney film. It's extremely kid-friendly (I think I've mentioned this for the umpteenth time), and looking at the line up of offerings this Christmas season, this is certainly a no brainer for anyone to bring their whole family to. It doesn't try to be more than it is, and has this fuzzy warm feeling for its ending that suits the mood for celebration. It doesn't go over the top, and the ensemble cast all looked as if they had a good time putting together something for the season, for all to enjoy. Not an instant classic, but the bedtime stories here will grow on you. Recommended!"
College Road Trip             ,dbw119,1,adventure,2008,8,"I caught a sneak preview of College Road Trip last night and I must admit, there were a lot of belly laughs at some of Martin Lawrence's overprotective antics. He really played the over-protective father role to a T. The theater was packed with kids and parents, who both seemed to enjoy the movie on different levels. I saw a bunch of father's in the theater sitting with their daughters and really relating to Martin Lawrence's grief on-screen. You could tell they really empathized with the instinct to protect their children and the idea of them growing up too fast. The little boy and pig were really cute and a great addition to the story. I have loved Raven from her days as Olivia on The Cosby Show, so it was great seeing her no the big screen. Overall, I really enjoyed this film for the light-hearted jokes and real father-daughter moments."
The Duchess             ,csrothwec,1,misc,2011,NA,"Superb job by the costume designers, hairstylists and location spotters. Nice to see Charlotte Rampling in a big production again as well. What of the two leads, Fiennes and Knightley? They really try and some of the scenes are quite moving, but, overall, a second rate script defeats them, which, basically, does not have enough 'meat' to cover the entire length of the movie (meaning that we get lots of scenes inserted on the same principle as 'The Tudors' TV series - 'ten minutes up, undergarments down' and time for a bit of carnal viewing for the audience). Overall, I came away feeling the script writer/director had tried to be just a little too clever in getting the 'parallels' across: a beautiful, young member of the minor aristocracy is 'auctioned off' by her parents to marry a (much older) member of the 'top of society' (have you got it yet?) Her family name is 'Spencer' (have you got it now?) The old fogey she marries only wants her to produce a male heir (come on!) and it becomes apparent he has no interest in her at all as a person. In the end, he forms a relationship with another woman (who has lots of strapping, healthy sons) and they form a 'menage a trois' under the same roof (Ahh, now you've got it!!!!!!) In the end, she fights against love and following her heart (and going for cruises on big yachts in the Mediterranean?) and instead sacrifices herself for the sake of her beloved children. MORALE: women in the 18th century had it rotten and is it not lovely to live in an enlightened, blissful era like ourselves instead??! As I said, I would concentrate on the hats (how DID they keep those things on top the massive haystacks of hair piled up on their skulls??"
35 Shots of Rum             ,Miakmynov,0,drama,2009,NA,"If like me, you're the kind of person who's desk is always tidy with everything in the right place, who appreciates clarity and structure, and is in generally on the wrong-end of the societal norm of 'just go with the flow', then this film could prove to be quite a challenge.The first few minutes encapsulate the movie in miniature. We spend the time zipping around a French metro system going nowhere in particular, via a camera attached to the front of various trains, as the timespan unfolds from daylight to darkness. This is intercut with shots of a good-looking chain-smoking bloke in his fifties, watching the subway trains from his motorbike by the side of the tracks. What is he waiting for? What does he look so worried about? Why does he eventually leave? For every answer meted out, another dozen questions take its' place.The plot, such as it is, concerns the changing relationship between a beautiful father/daughter combo (which, at times, seemed to me almost incestuous in tone), and their extended family of neighbours. Most 'stuff' is left unsaid for the viewer to interpret. Instead we are treated to languid, lingering shots of things like, er, doorways and skin. This is most definitely art-house territory, with bits of French-ness thrown in.I stayed for the Q&A after the Edinburgh Film Festival showing, in the hope that the director (Claire Denis) might shed some light on her work, and indeed she did  long, rambling answers that veered all over the place in an entirely inoffensive but generally incoherent way  just like her film really. Nice enough to look at, but not really my cup of thé au lait, even if there had been some in sulky Noe's fridge. 4/10"
Milk             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,misc,2008,NA,"""Milk"" sees Gus Van Sant return to the mainstream after nearly a decade of divisive 'arthouse' films, a spell he might have felt was necessary after directing ""Psycho"" and ""Finding Forrester"" back to back. The stunning, beautiful ""Gerry"" is still his greatest film in my estimation, but Van Sant's return to near-unanimous mainstream acclaim and some level of box-office success in ""Milk"" actually isn't too far off as far as Van Sant's filmography goes. Some may express disappointment that ""Milk"" is a 'conventional' biopic, but it really isn't conventional at all. True, this could have been the sort of melancholy meditation Van Sant has been going for in recent years, but the best argument against that is that Harvey Milk is not that figure. He's not going to sit quietly and contemplate life. Perhaps he might have before we meet him on the eve of his fortieth birthday, but from that point onwards Harvey Milk was a man of action, of words, a man with the powerful ability to rally people for a cause, and not only gay people. He had a rare sort of energy, and an energetic film was needed to tell his story. Most impressive perhaps about Van Sant's direction and Dustin Lance Black's screenplay is that there are just as many of those melancholic, meditative moments as needed, just enough to make this a compelling character study and not a truly conventional biopic with a hero rather than a main character. The photography here is also simply gorgeous, and the camera work is outstanding, particularly the hand-held work during the rally scenes. It really succeeds in transporting you to 1970's San Francisco. Sean Penn has frequently annoyed me. I respect his abilities, but reserve the right to express my subjective annoyance at what I perceive as sometimes hilarious over-acting. When I found out that he was going to play Harvey Milk I was nervous, since I have admired Harvey Milk ever since I was first exposed to him through the Rob Epstein documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"", which is still the best movie made about Harvey Milk, with ""Milk"" running a close second, and I doubt Bryan Singer's ""Mayor of Castro Street"" will be a serious contender. I had no reason to be nervous. Penn's performance is one of the most vibrant, fascinating, brilliant performances in years, and one of the most convincing and human. It's not a Harvey Milk impression, it's more than just that, but he truly does capture the 'essence' of Milk, if you will. It is pointless to make a political statement in the body of this review, so take this as one only if you have to: it is disgusting that in 2008 gay rights still a matter of political debate. This film is a powerful, beautiful tribute to the rights movement. It's not a Democrats vs. Republicans film. In fact, it makes it clear that Harvey Milk was once a Republican, and sneaks in footage of Reagan in strong opposition of Proposition 6. Those short scenes should provoke some thought and discussion. They certainly did for me and the people I saw the film with. Ultimately however the film is not about an 'issue'. Harvey Milk says to Dan White that it's not about jobs or rights, that it's their lives that they were and still are fighting for. Ultimately this film is about people, not about issues, not about policy. It's about people who were told they were sick, who were told they were wrong, who were told they would corrupt society, who were accused of being pedophiles and attempting to 'recruit' children to homosexuality. The film is about Harvey Milk, a mere human being who did more for freedom and tolerance than he probably ever understood. ""I am not a candidate, I am part of a movement. The movement is the candidate."" Unfortunately, the fight against the rampant discrimination against and hatred of homosexuals is still not over. Milk's movement lives on, and grows stronger every day. He would be proud of that, and devastated that our society has not truly progressed, but only learned to mask its intolerance and hatred. 1"
The Brothers Bloom             ,tawdry_hepburn,1,action,2009,9,"Conning Linguists: The Brothers Bloom In a summer full of dumber than dumb spectacle, and subtext free action porn ""The Brothers Bloom"" is a breath of fresh air.With wit, warmth, and beautiful settings galore the film creates a delightfully wacky alternate world full of whimsy, romance, and adventure.At the beginning of the film we meet two orphaned brothers, Stephen Bloom (Mark Ruffalo) and Bloom Bloom (Adrien Brody). From the age of 10, the brothers are con-artists, always spinning yarns and creating characters, inventing new and increasingly elaborate ways of separating their mark from his money while also giving him exactly what he wants in life. Everything changes when Bloom decides to get out of the game and Stephen lures him in for one last swindlea beautiful and quirky millionaire (Rachel Weisz) who yearns for a taste of adventure.The Brothers Bloom is the second feature from writer/director Rian Johnson. He previously took the indie world by storm with his award winning debut, ""Brick"". As with ""Brick"" Johnson again takes elements of several fallow genres and remixes them into something that feels both new and old all at once. The result is nothing short of magical. The characters pop off the screen and the dialogue and images loop back in on themselves making winking references that are sure to inspire fits of giggles from anyone who stayed awake during AP Lit. But, even if you don't recognize the title as a Dostoevsky reference, the film is sure to entertain.At the center of it all is Brody who is tasked with playing the straight man during the film's increasingly convoluted comic twists and turns. Perpetually at his side is Ruffalo, who has great fun playing the off the wall, yet always-sincere idea man who writes his schemes the way Russians write novels. The chemistry between the duo is infectious. It's like the two have known each other for their entire lives. They could not look less similar, and yet one never questions their bond.Weisz is absolutely electric as the object of Brody's affections and the subject of Ruffalo's confidence game. She plays the kind of bubbly, strange woman that really only exists in movies but imbues her with a quiet sadness that grounds the entire picture and ensures that the more surreal elements never take too much of a hold on the film.Though there is only one large-scale explosion, ""The Brothers Bloom"" demands the big screen treatment. It was filmed all over Europe and South America and the locations are used to great effect. These aren't sound stages, and it really makes a difference. Every shot is impeccably framed, it's as if Hal Ashby shot ""The Sting"".The film is not for all tastes. It requires attention from the viewer, and plays at a leisurely pace compared to many films currently in theaters, and some of the more action oriented beats don't quite gel with the rest of the film, but for those who can appreciate a story that gives itself room to breath, and for those willing to forgive the overly long third act, there is plenty to love.Most of the movies coming out over the next few months are simply product, attractive, eye catching, and ultimately little more than 90 minute advertisements for the sequel. Not so with ""The Brothers Bloom."" If you've got a girlfriend and you owe her a decent date movie you can't do much better than this. If you have a boyfriend and you don't want to make him suffer through ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" this is a great choice. If you've already seen all the action spectaculars, here's something else to see. Or, you know, if you just like good movies<U+0085>"
Yes Man             ,Joejoesan,0,comedy,2008,8,"After commercial failures like Lemony Snicket, Fun with Dick and Jane and The Number 23 Jim Carrey could use another hit. Yes Man might just do the trick. It will undoubtedly not only mark Carrey's return to box office greatness (a 45 million dollar opening (when there are no snowstorms around)?), it will also go into history as the first movie in which the Canadian born actor gets oral sex on screen. No kidding. But more on that later.Yes Man is a typical Jim Carrey feel good movie. Like Bruce Almighty (a human becomes God), The Mask (a mask transforms a zero into a hero) and Liar Liar (a man is forced to tell the truth all the time) the film has a strong but ridiculous premise. What would happen if you said yes to every offer that you got? The story features Carl Allen (Carrey), a dull man who got stuck in a dull life. He's living the same life for at least three years now <U+0096> ever since his girlfriend left him for another. His best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper) tries to draw him back into life, but Carl remains a hermit, saying no to every invitation he gets. When he accidentally forgets Peter's engagement party Carl decides to change his life drastically. He signs up for a Yes Man seminar by philosophy guru Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) and embraces life by saying yes to any offer that's made to him. Guitar lessons, flying lessons, even a penis enlargement: Carl is your man. And wow, his life does get better. Carl not only gets a promotion, he also meets the charming Alison (Zooey Deschanel), a free spirit who sings in a band and has a job as a photographer. The two fall in love. But what happens when Alison finds out about his Yes Man way of life and begins to doubt if he really wants to choose for her?Ever since I saw the trailer I wanted to see Yes Man. In dark times we all need a laugh and let's face it: there's a lot of truth in the fact that only a Yes opens up new opportunities in life. Luckily, Jim Carrey fans should not be worried: Yes Man delivers the goods. The story is safely predictable and although Carrey carries the movie, he gets help from a strong supporting cast. Terrence Stamp is great as Yes man guru. Bradley Cooper <U+0096> Carrey best friend in the movie - is a handsome man with some great screen presence. This movie could be his real breakthrough. But the real treat in Yes Man is Zooey Deschanel (The Happening, Bridge to Terabithia) as Carrey's love interest Alison. You can't help but falling in love with her in this movie. She's happily strange and immensely charming. I give her a 9/10 on the Drew Barrymore scale (with Drew having a 10/10 of course). Storywise Yes man starts rather nice. When Carl learns that 'Yes' means progress and 'No' could mean punishment he reluctantly agrees to almost anything <U+0096> including his 70 year old toothless female neighbor giving him oral sex. I don't know what to think of the scene actually. It is funny, but it's a long way from the Claw in Liar Liar <U+0096> if you know what I mean. Needless to say, Yes man is not exactly family entertainment. On the other hand, in Transformers there was also a dialogue about masturbating. So maybe Hollywood is growing up. One of the funniest scenes is the one that follows the kissing of a beautiful girl in the bar (as seen in the trailer). Her boyfriend wants to beat up Carl and what follows is a very funny fight between a muscled dumbo and a very drunk Carrey. In this scene Carrey really shows his comedic talent. Pretty hilarious.Overall Yes Man is nice entertainment. Carrey fans won't be disappointed and there are a lot of strong moments. Too bad the ending of the movie seems rushed. All the actions Carl undertakes under his Yes Man spell suddenly all turn out for the better (and that's just a little bit too convenient). The movie is only 82 minutes long and I suspect that there are a lot of scenes cut that could've given the story more drama and suspense. Despite the oral sex scene Yes Man is Jim Carrey's most romantic movie in a long while. Just watch the scene on the Hollywood Bowl stage... Well done!"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,danielledecolombie,0,action,2008,5,"The film is making zillions all over the world so what does it matter that it's just a mediocre attempt to recapture the energy, the youthfulness and the innocence of the previous installments? Love of cinema, that's what made me react the way I did. How can it possibly be that the most powerful people in the film world could agree that this was the script that everyone was waiting for? Shallow, opportunistic, over long, over crowded and implausible in a way the other films weren't regardless of their own implausibilities because one was connected tho the soul of the enterprise. There is no soul here to cling to. It's all by the numbers, odd numbers at that. Karen Allen returns! But look at the clumsiness of her re introduction. I was bitterly disappointed but maybe it's just me. 5"
Yes Man             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,comedy,2009,6,"Jim Carrey, a man who has delivered some of the most memorable comedies of the 90's: Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, and the Mask. He used to be one of the funniest men alive, now it's just kind of odd, he's gone into the drama genre in films, which is good, he's actually proved to be a good actor. But with the comedy, it's like he was once the person who you would be first to invite to the party because he was so funny, now he's the guy who invites himself to the party and laughs at his own jokes. I think because he's older it's just awkward watching him trying so hard to make people laugh. Not that Yes Man is a bad film, it's just a different version of Liar Liar, yet he's not even hypnotized into saying yes to everything, he just does so because he thinks it'll make his life better. So instead of feeling bad for him you just go ""ummm, are you an idiot?"". I don't wanna know if a man hit on him if he had to say yes to that too.Los Angeles bank employee Carl Allen has become withdrawn and depressed since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie. Routinely ignoring his friends, he has grown used to spending his spare time watching DVDs alone in his apartment. His outlook on life has become inherently negative. But when a friend persuades him to attend the ""Yes!"" self-improvement seminar, motivational guru Terrence Bundley publicly browbeats him into making a covenant with himself. Carl reluctantly promises to stop being a ""No Man"" and vows to answer ""Yes!"" to every opportunity, request or invitation that presents itself thereafter. After the seminar he meets Allison, an eccentric young woman who is refueling her scooter. After this experience, Carl adopts a positive mentality and seizes every opportunity that comes his way. He takes flying lessons, attends Korean language classes, learns to play the guitar, and even joins a Persian dating website. Saying ""yes"" constantly works to Carl's advantage. As their relationship blossoms, Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. But while checking in for the flight, Carl is detained by FBI agents, who have profiled him as potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian mail-order bride, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Then Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere.Yes Man is over all a good comedy, it has a few good laughs here and there. I think the plot just needed a bit of work, because like I said before it's just odd that he isn't hypnotized into saying yes constantly, he just does so because someone told him to do it. Yeah, it brought him to some great moments in his life, but he ordered a bride? He's just a little bit crazy. But over all I'd have to say that this movie is more of a rental vs. a theater experience. Jim Carrey can still make you laugh, but not the same as he used to, it's just time to grow up, how long can you make those stupid faces for without looking ridicules being a grown man? Well, the money helps I guess.6/10 "
"Surfer, Dude             ",phiup,0,comedy,2012,9,"Perhaps the reason why so many have reviewed this title in the negative is because they were expecting ""Dazed and Confused"" on water.IT'S NOT!!!!The movie starts off introducing the super laid back, somewhat irresponsible Steve Addington, or Add as he is referred to in the movie played by Matthew McConaughey. He has been to able to afford to be a carefree hippie surfer because of his sponsor. When his sponsor is bought out by former surfer, now super douche business exec, Add's life takes a dramatic financial turn.Addington's attitude is unwavering though. Because he is a ""Surfer dude! I surf."" He knows that he will get by even without the money. That is until the waves dry up. California and the entire pacific coast goes flat. Add suffers what can only be described as massive withdraws coupled with delusional psychosis.The morale of this story is 2 fold. 1. Find what you love and do that. 2. ""Be careful of what you love brother, cause it can drive you mad!""I would recommend this movie to dudes dating someone who loves Matthew McConaughey. Dudes who like to surf. Dudes who hate corporate America. and yes, dudes who smoke the reefer.AND its not all about the chiseled body of McConaughey, there are plenty of beach bunnies to check out during this movi"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,ZookGuy,0,drama,2008,7,"As of this writing, Benjamin Button is number 70 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of the year list. Many people believe this film deserves, in a year with films like Frost/Nixon and Doubt (and many others which I will not mention) that this is the one film which will bring home Best Picture.Wow. This is overrated. It will bring home the Oscars it deserves: Cinematography and Makeup, and if it's very, very, lucky, Special Effects. What bugs me most about the film is the thing at the core: the relationship between Daisy and Benjamin. It misses something very, very, important: why they fell in love in the first place.The most interesting section is one that completely captivated: when he has a love affair with a lady at the Russian hotel, why? Because they kept it at a brisk 30 minutes so it doesn't drag on for 2 hours, it gets you captivated, and it ends when it is meant to end. You can also tell why they had the affair in the first place: they wanted to find out to what it was like to be in love, or in the girls case: Benjamin's strange affliction.You (or at least me) become sick of Benjamin's relationship with Daisy when you realize it fails to ask the most important question at what is the dead center of the entire 2 hour 48 minute film: Why did they fall in love???Pitt gives a tolerable performance, nothing Oscar worthy. Blanchett, on the other hand was very good as Daisy, trying to fuel the chemistry with Pitt that just isn't there.It's also very long with a 168-minute runtime, it thinks it can spend all the time trying to win, but in the end, it fails. There are many useless scenes that could've been thrown out (particularly this one scene in which it shows all the things, which could've happened to prevent Daisy being hit by a cab, which leaves you thinking in the 5-minute section that feels more like 30 minutes which left me thinking ""when will this end???""). Worth a rental for the astounding cinematography and makeup."
The Express             ,bapaball,,misc,2008,7,"""The Express"" tells the story of Ernie Davis, the first African-American winner of football's Heisman Trophy. This could have been known as a factual, historically truthful movie IF the makers had not taken unnecessary racial shot at West Virginia University while producing the film. The movie includes a scene in which Mountaineer fans hurl racial slurs and trash at Davis and his Syracuse University teammates during a 1959 game in Morgantown.West Virginia was never mentioned in the original Charles Levitt script, nor did WVU play Syracuse during this historical time frame. Thus the film falsely depicts the West Virginia and WVU.Levitt says the script he gave Universal Pictures did not mention WV or West Virginia University. He had said that the scene was supposed to depict a 1958 game at Tar Heels Stadium in North Carolina - a choice that also displayed artistic license.""It is a sad fact of my business that when a screenwriter turns a script over to a studio, the studio and the filmmakers own it,"" wrote Leavitt. ""They can do anything they want with it - even rewrite parts of it without consulting me and without my knowledge or consent"
The Women             ,G_a_l_i_n_a,1,comedy,2008,2,"The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy, and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown, and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, smart, and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand ""Sex and the City"" which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we, the viewers together with her? The movies like ""The Women"" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, about dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines, dialogs, and situations so clichéd, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?After I saw the new movie, I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and kept my interest all the way. The old movie had a real star power"
Deception             ,dbborroughs,0,crime,2008,2,Accountant Ewan McGregor meets attorney Hugh Jackman and quickly gets in over his head. (I'm not going to say more since much of the film hinges on some late in the game twists) This should work. The cast is there. the film looks good (if unremarkable) but its incredibly dull. Who are these people and why should we care. Its clear from the instant the film starts that Jackman is up to something and that McGregor is in trouble. the problem is you just don't care. I didn't. And whats worse is that once the film starts to play out its twist-which is unbelievable and not possible (as few that use this twist are)- I was sitting there incredulous. I won't go into it but I I couldn't believe they were serious (especially since what happens isn't physically possible)
Deception             ,DICK STEEL,0,crime,2008,5,"The big joke making its rounds here about this movie was in its promotional poster for this part of the world. Perhaps to the West, Maggie Q would be just the chick from MI:3 and didn't warrant top billing, or a photograph in its poster. Here, we have a badly pasted ""extra"" face of hers plastered on the poster, supposedly banking on her popularity with Asians. Only that as it turned out, she only has 5 minutes worth of screen time, appearing in black lacy lingerie, and doing nothing. If that's the case, then Natasha Hendrige should also be included in the poster, since she's famous for showing off her body in the Species movies, and continues to do so here to remind everyone she hasn't really lost it yet.While Hancock has been proved not guilty of putting everything in the trailer that you can write a review out of it, the same cannot be said of Deception, no matter how its title sounded like in trying to throw you off track. It is exactly as it is played out in the 2 odd minutes of it, so if you were to want and try to enjoy this, do not watch any of its trailer nor its stills. It really ruined it outright, stripping away all surprises in store. And while Hancock kept important stuff under wraps to bring about heightened pleasure when all get revealed, Deception's ""surprise"" was like a limp premature ejaculation which didn't make much sense, and insults the audience.But that's not to say that it was bad all the way. The premise had potential, and if you're going into it blind, then there are enough to intrigue you, especially when it comes to the turn. Ewan McGregor slicks back his hair and puts on glasses to give himself the stereotypical bookish accountant look, in a firm to audit their books. As with all audits, keeping lonely late night vigils is a norm as everyone in the firm you're auditing automatically shun you, for fear of getting questioned. His Jonathan McQuarry cuts a pitiable figure that most of us in the corporate world will probably understand.In comes a highly sociable, humorous, and charismatic legal counsel of the firm, Wyatt Bose (played by Hugh Jackman, who also serves as producer), and the two hit it off over a late night filled with jokes and the sharing of pot in a conference room, before getting so chummy with each other, that going to strip clubs to chill out seemed perfectly OK. In a careless accident, they switch cell phones, and before you know it, Jonathan gets all excited over the prospect of milking Wyatt's exclusive high society sex club membership, where members call each other up anonymously through the service, and asks a seemingly innocent question ""Are you free tonight?"".Sure there are rules to Sex Club, such as no names, no details, no casual chit-chats, just the caller booking a room at the hotel, and the callee turning up as arranged to get their respective rocks off. I'm sure by now plenty of ah-peks would be interested to watch the movie already, but its M18 rating ensured that everything put on screen isn't hardcore stuff. I won't be surprised too if something of this nature already exists, serving a rich clientèle who spend 90% of their waking hours in the office, leaving no time for anything else. Think of it as a matchmaking service that goes into that bit of extra.Complicating matters of course is when Jonathan falls genuinely in love with one of the members called S (Michelle Williams), whom he met outside of the club at a train station. Being totally smitten with her, he refuses to do the deed, and breaks almost all the rules. Then begin the cat and mouse mind games, which of course would have worked, but the last act just became convenience after convenience, that made it eventually a very lazy piece of storytelling.Deception tried, but didn't try hard enough. It had great foreplay, adequate skills, but no stamina to last the distance. Strictly for fans of McGregor and Jackman only, and of course those who still want to check Maggie Q out in lingerie, or to admire that Hendsridge still has it in her."
Summer Hours             ,kerkevik,1,drama,2008,9,"A marvellously descriptive examination of the power of memories, and the pull of the present in the eventual destruction of those memories.I decided, principally, to see this film because of the presence of Juliette Binoche in the cast but, even tough hers is a strongly written character, and the acting of Binoche is of it's usual highest standard, it was the heartbreak portrayed by the oldest, and youngest, members of the extended family that really affected me the most.The most heartbreaking moments came towards the very end, and were played out without being overly sentimentalised. You are left wondering at the uselessness of hanging onto the past when all that are left are museum pieces."
Untraceable             ,tatz32000,1,crime,2008,7,"This story of a crazed killer using hits on a website to ""assist"" him in his killings is a refreshing high tech twist on the what I call the ""killer-thriller"" type of film. Not all the computer gibberish is comprehensible to those of us--such as myself--who aren't computer geniuses, but the major or breakthrough plot points--the eye blinks for one, the early use of what is actually the GM Onstar system in her SUV for another--are carefully planted and credible.It's irrelevant to whom Diane Lane is married in real life, or who her mother in law is....what matters is that her performance here is top flight. She lets the makeup department avoid glamorizing her, and she comes across very convincingly as a 40 something woman professional highly competent in her job. I'm not a huge fan of hers (I recall her miscast role in the stinker ""Must Like Dogs"", but now I'm digressing, sorry) but her performance here is nuanced and top flight. Refreshingly, the filmic style is even vaguely evocative of those wonderful 1940's Film Noirs, with rainy nights and a generally dark patina. I hear Portland is a cold, rainy city, so setting the story there was a wise move for atmosphere.Some other writers have already made the point that is a bit amazing how the ""bad guy"" is sooo competent, and even hacks into her Saab's engine computer....but, hey, maybe its possible and even if it's not it still gives the film an exciting sequence. Not a masterpiece, but very much worth seeing...."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,iamdyer,0,action,2008,1,"There was a trailer beforehand of Kung Fu Panda somethingorother. The film then started with the Paramount mountain, formed from a gopher mound, and an unrealistic CG gopher poking it's head out of the mound. I actually didn't realise this was the film, and still thought I was watching a Disney trailer. This was my first sign that the film was going to be a filing cabinet full of soiled underwear.This complete cowpat of a film is truly a sign of the shifting zeitgeist of what is expected from cinema. At least from Lucas et al.There was so much wrong with this film, I don't even know where to start. Every scene was a howler. Story has now been replaced by technical ability with CGI. Character development is now abandoned in favour of a panicked attention-grabbing frenzy of disconnected scenes. Comedy comes from prat-falling CG chipmunks, rather than wit or a character's reaction to a situation (remember the German bad guy and Indy's reaction to the Arab on the windshield of the truck in 'Raiders'? Hilarious!). The bloated chase scene was incomprehensibly ludicrous. Fantastical CGI renderings paved the way for unrealistic feats of human acrobatics that would not have been out of place in the Matrix Reloaded car chase.Think of the scenes in Raiders where people are actually talking to each other for extended periods: Belloq and Indy in the Marrakesh bar; Indy and Sallah looking at the headpiece in the old man's house; Indy and Marcus talking about the ark with the CIA guys in his University. These are all great scenes. Classic scenes. They divide the action and drama nicely. They set the stage and peg the narrative so you know - without being patronised - what is going on. I didn't have a clue what was happening in Crystal Skull, and just as I was getting my bearings - an alien spaceship took off!!! I whispered to the guy next to me 'Please... make it stop.'.I really thought that Lucas would have learned a very sore lesson from the reaction to the re-hashed Star Wars movies. We don't want Midichlorians. We don't want CGI. We don't want prat-falling comedy robots and gophers. We want soul, scene, story, character, mis en scene, tension, performance, dialogue, good casting, solid character relationships.You will not get this from 'Crystal'.Which scene scared you more: Marion hanging 15 meters off the ground from the statue of Anubis in Raiders, or Marion driving (giggling) off a cliff into a tree (with no guarantee that she wasn't going snap the branches or miss the tree altogether) only to be let down gently into the water by the flexing tree, still giggling?This film has stretched tension and drama into the ludicrous and that's exactly what it ends up being. Ludicrous.When you come out of the cinema screen, turn around and look at the expressions of the people walking out behind you. I did, and it was a collective 'Has someone just farted?'High Points: Denholm Elliot's breathtaking performance.Low Points: Everything else. 5"
Nim's Island             ,inkblot11,1,adventure,2008,6,"Nim (Abigail Breslin) and her marine biologist father (Gerard Butler) live on an island in the South Pacific. Dad's main area of study is microorganisms so this is a perfect venue for his work, in addition to being a kingdom where only the two of them rule. As Nim's mother died in an accident on the waters, it is also a good place for them to shut out the rest of the world and heal their spirits. Nim's only close friends are her beloved animals, a seal, a seabird, and a lizard. One day, father wants to make a boat trek nearby to look for a new protozoa and, for once, Nim convinces him to let her remain alone on the island. It turns out to be a bad decision, as father gets caught in a storm and can not return home at the appointed time. Nim appeals to an adventure writer named Alex Rover to come to the island and help look for her father (the island does have computer technology!) But, unknown to Nim, Alex is really Alexandra (Jodie Foster) and she is a shy agoraphobic who resides in San Francisco. Nevertheless, due to the gravity of the situation, Alex boards a plane and begins a journey to the island. Will she get there in time to save Nim and her father from destruction? On paper, this is a certain winner, for the basic premise of the movie is quite good and the undiscovered island setting is the stuff of dreams. Throw in the great threesome of Foster, Breslin, and Butler, and one could hardly ask for more, right? Unfortunately, this is not the case and it is difficult to say why, for the principal actors are quite good and the scenery is lovely. Also, there is some sly humor, as in the scene where a hula dancer is stopped in mid-wave to escape an exploding volcano! Perhaps, it is the story's inconsistencies and the slap-dash direction that are at fault, for the scenes seem put together in a mozaic that doesn't quite fit. Then, too, Butler takes on two roles, one as the father and one as the fictional alter-ego, Alex Rover, of Foster's books, with mixed results. To sum it up, the movie probably tries to do ""too many things"" and ends up lacking a real focus. However, it is absolutely an acceptable film for families, with enough adventure to please most age groups and a setting that is exotic and lovely beyond belief. Anyone searching for something new in the ""child-friendly"" category would find this one a good watch, but not a great one, alas."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,Cognition,1,comedy,2008,8,"This film was shown at my university tonight and Stoller was there for a Q&A after the screening. The film was the typical Apatow romp that we have seen as of late (Superbad, Knocked up, etc.). There was the usual crude and creative humor as well inappropriate sexuality to make another great Apatow team production. People should not come in with the expectation that this is another romantic comedy reincarnation of ""Knocked Up"". This is more of a typical and organic romantic comedy. The heavy emotional weight and issues in ""Knocked up"" are not present in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The casting and comedic pacing was done very well and though it may not be a cinematic heavy hitter, it was very good for a directing debut and it was what movies all strive to be, entertaining. 1"
Pride and Glory             ,joebloggscity,,crime,2008,7,"Films revolving around a family of policemen are nothing new. Pride & Glory, starring Norton & Farrell, isn't anything revolutionary in the genre but takes a generally strong storyline and adds some good acting.Story revolves around a group of cops (led by Farrell) up to their necks in trouble after their corrupt scams have backfired on them, and to cover their backs they need to tread deeper into the mire. On the other hand is Norton (Farrell's brother-in-law) who slowly discovers what's going on, and it all goes helter-skelter.In many ways in these films they can get a little clichéd and melodramatic, but this film seems conscious of that fact, and in general has strayed away from what it could have been. Nevertheless, its nothing special but still interesting. The main interest is the family politics and dynamics and that should keep your interest with the generally good acting. An enjoyable movie."
The Brothers Bloom             ,tritisan,1,action,2008,9,"What a wonderful surprise: Yesterday my sister calls me and tells me that there's a new film by the director of Brick, playing at the Mill Valley Film Festival. ""I'm there!""Even before we get in the theater, I know we're in for a different experience. A pair of toughs with metal detectors wave us down for hidden cameras and demand we turn our cell phones off. I'm surprised we didn't have to take our shoes off. Endgame Entertainment certainly doesn't want any leaks.Once inside, the director, Rian Johnson, shows up just before the show starts, fresh off a flight from Abu Dhabi no less. He gives a short interview with Mark Fishkin (long time director of the festival), coming off as a very charming, self-effacing, funny and unpretentious fellow. I like him immediately. Hollywood has not corrupted him (yet).Like Tarantino, Johnson has closely studied films and makes constant references and nods to The Classics, especially from the 40s and 50s. Unlike Tarantino, Johnson writes more original stories and has good taste and far gentler sensibilities. Obvious influences include: Wes Anderson, The Cohen Bros, Billy Wilder, John Huston.The film itself? Instant classic. It's got all the elements you could want in a Hollywood-style movie: Charming characters, plot twists, tons of gags, an incredibly beautiful leading lady, sumptuous sets and locations, and an overall sense ""gee-whiz-isn't-this-fun!""And it's classy, too. It doesn't resort to needless, sensationalist sex and violence. The writer respects and honors the audience's intelligence, a all-too-rare occurrence these days.You could tell that the actors had a blast with the sometimes subtle, sometimes slap-stick script, relishing their characters' quirks and foibles.Overall, Brothers Bloom almost manages perfection. It's one fault lies in the resolution, the last 5 minutes where it's tone abruptly changes for darker. Without giving anything away, I feel that it was too heavy-handed, considering the generally light and wacky spirit that had predominated. The rest of the audience seemed to feel the same way, given the hushed mood as the credits rolled. If the producers have an alternate ending up their sleeves, I suggest they use it, even it has to be somewhat ambiguous. Otherwise, I'm happy to contribute to the positive buzz. I really think Brothers Bloom could be a huge hit, even a timeless classic. 1"
Adoration             ,pc95,0,drama,2010,4,"Adoration is one of those stupefying movies that begin to annoy you as the movie runs along culminating to utter contrivance reducing it to junk. The movie feels totally fraudulent by the time the final credits are scrolling mostly because of it's artificial and preposterous writing.(spoiler)The whole movie boils down to a horribly 2-Dimensional racially/religiously charged arguments between Lebonese Dad and Prejudiced Father-In-Law, one which sets the needed friction and momentum for everything else. The movie attempts to weave a big web of details too big for it's own good. There is dead-end scenes over and over talking about terrorism depicted on internet ""chatrooms"" adding zero - nothing but extraneous dead weight for the sake of shock value and ""buzz"". This is similar to watching characters in a movie watch another movie or TV - it flat out conveys nothing.(another spoiler)By the end we have a young kid questioning his past and some strangely obsessed Lebonese French teacher egging him on to create untruthful stories about his father to deal with his pent-up emotional grief fortified on by earlier stated Father-in-Law (Grand-father). This is a movie that got re-edited too muc"
Changeling             ,bobsgrock,1,misc,2008,8,"Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen, from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kick-butt cop. As a director, he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see, including the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film, he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown (Los Angeles). Taken from true events, the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nine-year old son, Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene, and about two months later, her son is returned. Then, she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.From the moment the young boy steps off the train, Christine insists to everyone that he is not her son. Unfortunately, the police say she is delusional and just upset. The films leads to the truth of the matter, which is that the corruption in the department has led to them being lackadaisical in their duties. The story moves along fluidly, yet we are never really told the reason that corruption resides.Nevertheless, the film is quite an experience. It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is solid as Christine, yet I felt she seemed more whiny at times than desperate. It just didn't move me as strongly as Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The supporting cast is good as well, especially John Malkovich as the pastor eager to help Christine in the fight against the LAPD. What I really wanted was that emotional pull that Eastwood's other films had. This one seemed a bit cold and ruthless, despite that being its subject material. So, I would say to go and see it; it is definitely worth the 140 minutes. As for Oscar time, I can't say for sure that it will wrap up the big ones such as Best Picture, Director or Actress. It wasn't the strongest campaign I've seen, but then again this has been a weaker year than 2007. 1"
Frozen River             ,Seamus2829,1,crime,2008,10,"I had heard that this film was something of a runaway hit at Cannes last year. After seeing it, I can see why. 'Frozen River' is a grim little tale of a middle aged woman (Melissa Leo)who's good for nothing, substance abusing,gambler husband has left her & their two sons for points unknown (only after usurping all of the money from the bank--and this,just a week before Christmas). Rae (Leo)has to earn some money soon, or lose their trailer home. She resorts to smuggling illegal aliens (with the assistance of an Indian woman who dislikes whites)over the boarder,from Canada to the U.S., via the local Indian reservation. Toss in elements of a cynical teen aged son,and other similar elements,and you have yourself a powerful piece of drama that although somewhat bleak,manages to draw you in to the plight of people who want to fit in, but are never the less, not excepted,due to racial issues. Well worth seeking out. The film has been slapped an R-rating by the MPAA, due to some course language."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,LikeAn_Angel,0,misc,2008,7,"As with the last user who commented, the reason for this score was purely the dancing. Now, to be fair, the acting abilities of the two main characters was average...even above average at times...though not stellar. However, their dancing was freaking SICK. I've seen a lot, and some of this freestyle was off the charts incredible. The only reason that I went to see this movie, in fact.Briana Evigan (Andie) is an amazingly talented dancer. Her acting was actually not that bad, I was pleased. Robert Hoffman (Chase) was the typical charming, blond-haired and privileged pretty-boy...with an edge. His dancing was phenomenal, they were both exciting to watch. Their chemistry together was enough to make it hard to tear my eyes from the screen. If the trailers entertain you, and you're a fan of dance see this movie. Though the plot is weak, and the dialogue laughable, the dancing is enough to make spending your $8 on the ticket more than worth it. 1"
Wanted             ,ggulcher,1,action,2008,4,"I left this film shaking my head in disgust at the worthless, corrupt and ethically-bankrupt sewer that Hollywood has become. I knew I was going to a violent action film, I knew its story was about assassins, and I am neither religious nor squeamish about screen violence when it serves a good story - but I did not agree to have my face rubbed in corpses of little old ladies impaled on meat hooks and used as firing range targets; in geysers of blood, bone, brains and random gore spurting in extreme close-up and slo-mo from the craniums of Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and 48 for 50 minor others, then repeated in reverse. Hollywood is sick. It is so devoid of able writers that it's reduced to serving up buckets of gratuitous, graphic gore and human atrocities sufficient to nauseate Josef Mengele, so as to fill that gaping void where a coherent story and, more importantly, a civilized code of ethics, ought to be.In yet another of Hollywood's weird adolescent-type cries for help, this film is yet another packed with gratuitous, Beavis & Butthead-caliber profanity between every fourth or fifth word of dialog. It's that thing where teenagers think that grown-up-type ""bad words"" will impress all observers into ""ooohs"" and ""aaaahs"" and thereby obscure desperately-concealed deficiencies of character. Or maybe these ""writers"" assume their presumptive audience will be just as juvenile as they. Rather pathetic in any case, now epidemic in Hollyweird. Again, I am specifically *not* a WCTU-type religious fundamentalist - but it doesn't take much mental effort to understand the contempt for humanity and the impotent frustration with life that are implicit to gratuitous profanity. To hear actors of the caliber of Morgan Freeman agreeing to deliver that pathetic tripe is just painful. On the plus side, there were some excellent action sequences and enjoyable spectacle - the train derailment sequence and the car chases managed to be original, even balletic. None of the action in this film was plausible in context of basic physics, of course, but the film managed to suspend disbelief adequately to compensate.Unfortunately, along with the wall-to-wall human butchery and pottymouth dialog, the story never rose above lame and sloppy. The intrigue of a ""secret order"" was quickly abandoned as a mere detail of setting; the ""Loom of Fate"" apparently ran itself, since no explanation was given as to who or what set it in motion; the actors almost to a one were mere foils for extravagant and, again, atrocious visuals. I won't even bother to go into the contemptible ""Sling Blade"" ethic of ""Murder is A-OK if you have a good reason."" Suffice it to stand as a stark reminder of where Hollywood's proctological worldview has inevitably taken it.Bottom line: ""Wanted"" is a film that left me feeling in equal parts annoyance, disappointment, and an overpowering desire to go home and wash."
Nights in Rodanthe             ,evetan00000,1,drama,2008,6,"Nights in Rodanthe is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks and I have read a few of his works which mainly involves 2nd-chance romance w a hint of tragedy behind it. I remembered 'A Walk To Remember', 'The Notebook', 'Message In A Bottle'. Starring Richard Gere & Diane Lane, it's a story about a housewife who just divorced her husband and was helping out her best friend's beach inn when Dr Paul arrived at the inn to stay for 5 days. Both had problems they had to face and through these few days they found each other and fell in love. Unfortunately they had to part but continued to keep in touch the old-fashioned way until... Initially, I was a bit reluctant to even make an effort to go to this movie but since it's Nicholas Sparks, I thought I should give it a chance cos Im no fan of Richard Gere nor Diane Lane. The story is pretty pacey w enough sexual tension between the 2 stars, I love the beach inn though, just what I would picture my dream beach house to be, except not that huge and prob not that close to the sea. Surprisingly I found myself mesmerized by Richard Gere, especially his eyes so I would say for his age, he's still very charming. This story is a tearjerker and even tho Im resistant to tearing, it did squeeze out a few drops and certain parts of the movie so it's still good. Overall, a so-so movie that makes you feel like you want to be in love again the old-fashioned way."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,vegania,0,action,2008,1,"Spoilers ahead.I was waiting for this film since the first time I heard It was going to be made, about four years ago. Then came the problems with the script. Spielberg likes this one, but Lucas not, etc. Then they said they had difficulties to match their agendas. Finally the movie was made; almost twenty years later I had my tickets and watched Harrison Ford as Indy again at last...People, what took you so long?, after all the wait you come up with this? Despite the digital animal that opens the film and seeing Indy survive an atomic explosion (?!!) by using a fridge, the first part of the movie still remind the audience to the original Indy, but once they travel to Peru the film is completely lost (BTW is using a CGI really THAT necessary for that simple opening scene?, don't they remember we've seen thousands of snakes, bugs, bats and rats in the same franchise, all of them for real?).Once the travel to South America (what's the point on showing us they take the motorbike with them?, just to say ""oh I left it at the cemetery""?) it turns into a ""mummy"" movie, with all the abuse of CGIs that is common these days in almost every Hollywood movie, but it's really painful to find all those cheap cheesy cartoonish digital effects in a Spielberg movie.The script is so easy that all the characters do is running straight till the end of the movie. They escape from the Russians, they escape from the ants, they escape from the indians just running straight and using this multi purpose skull. No real troubles for our hero, not any sub-plot, not any emotion, nor romance, nor thrilling adventure. Laaame.It is really hard to believe this movie was directed by Spielberg. At least not that mythical 80's Spielberg. Crystall Skull is a lot more like Spielberg's Hook or Amistad.When he was shooting, Spielberg said with a big smile that he was making this movie for all the fans, and I believed him. Now I see this movie is nothing but a practical joke for all of them. I feel sort of betrayed.The only good thing about this nonsense is seeing Ford again as Indy. He does his best, and he is REALLY Indiana. It's a shame the rest weren't able to meet the challenge.Steven, George: what happened to you? I just don't understand. 2"
The Lucky Ones             ,monkspaceman,,adventure,2009,10,"I sat down to this film not knowing anything beyond what the trailer depicted...and I had only a vague memory of that. Is it a drama, a comedy, a what...? I can honestly say that I think the answer is yes. To all. It's the most honest, solid, watchable film I've seen in a long time. Nothing seemed forced, gratuitous, or pandering... it's just a well told, and acted, human story. Neither a magical, nor let-down ending...unless one would count ""I wish more films could be made this well"" as a let down.So, that's my opinion, which doesn't mean much...unless you are like me, and enjoy the quality of a film more than the franchise future possibilities of one"
The Brothers Bloom             ,Okonh0wp,1,action,2009,5,"The Brothers Bloom, dir. Rian Johnson-The film had some very good elements: -The visual look was terrific. I wasn't sure if it was a period piece or it was set in the late 2000's, because there was a definite lack of cell phones and other modern day aparatuses in the frame. It was very retro, yet very much in the present -Rachel Weicz was such a fascinating character. How could a woman that beautiful and rich be so lonely? Weicz manages to pull it off. An absolutely amazing performance and kudos to her for learning all those talents (apparently she had to learn all those talents) -Some of the dialogue was exceptional. Penelope's speech about reinventing her life and refusing to see her loneliness as a weakness was definitely thought-provoking.At the same time, the film on the whole didn't make any sense. It was too many twists to the point where you just didn't care what was going on screen because none of it was real and there wasn't much suspense to convince you that the film might have been heading in any other direction. It would have always made more sense for Adrian Brody's character to just marry Penelope and inherit her fortune."
The Strangers             ,cronicallystoic,,horror,2008,1,"Oh my freaking god this needs to be the last, I'm a dumb bitch and got killed by dumber murders movie ever. Holy Christ in Heaven, frosty the snowman is scarier than this damn movie. Freaking god, it was one hour and twenty minutes of me wanting Liv Tyler to hurry up and die, and damn it all if she didn't live. It doesn't take an hour to kill two morons, trust me. In fact, I could have killed them all seventeen and half times over by then. Seinfeld was scarier. Dora the damn Explorer is scarier. Quit acting Liv Tyler and other pointless guy no one cares about. Quit directing Bryan, you have NO talent. This movie was free and I demand my $34 dollars back for life wasted. At least cigarettes tell you you're about to lose some of your life. Seriously."
The Ruins             ,digginglife66-1,,adventure,2008,8,"The Ruins has it's typical horror movie cliché's, but aren't really that big of a deal compared to the overall effect the movie has. The nudity scene is very short and not very explicit, the cheating girlfriend thing isn't that big of a deal either. The only corny parts in this movie I would consider mediocre and not that big of a deal.The acting was overall pretty decent. I've always been impressed with Ashmore since he played the only good role in the ""Animorphs"" TV series. I was also very impressed with Jonathan Tucker's acting. Malone and Ramsey through in great performances as well.The chills in this movie were real. My fiancé' was so disturbed during this movie that at one point he started biting my scalp. The movie also uses an excellent balance of silence and music in appropriate sections. And the fact that the audience is kept in the dark about some of ""why"" this was going on is also a big bonus. There isn't an overabundance of blood and gore, but it's great for this movie. Kudos for a horror flick that does it right!"
Shutter             ,Argemaluco,0,horror,2008,4,"Shutter (2004) was not a great horror film but it was a competent one.It was entertaining and it had some creepy moments.But,now,we have another unnecessary Hollywood remake.Shutter (2008) is a crap.Simple as that.The ''scary'' moments produced accidental laughs on me.But,in spite of laughing a little bit,this movie enormously bored me.The special effects are pathetic.The actors show zero conviction on their roles.Director Masayuki Ochiai made a mercenary work.The only positive thing I can find in this crap is that the ending from the original film was not changed.Shutter is an unnecessary remake.In summary,this is another crappy remake.Hollywood MUST stop with this remakes."
Twilight             ,DemonicAnthony,1,misc,2008,1,"This review may contain spoilers. You've been warned. Twilight was a terrible film adaption of a, let's face it, mediocre novel. I went into the theater with an open mind, not expecting brilliance, but expecting to be entertained. Well, I guess I was technically entertained since I laughed throughout most of the movie. Sadly, I wasn't laughing at purposely funny moments. I was laughing at the awkward ""acting"" of the actors and the terrible dialogue.Now this is where it gets tricky: Do we blame the screenwriter or the author? The movie made me realize just how corny the book's dialogue was. I found myself rolling my eyes, when I wasn't laughing, at every word out of the actor's mouth. Especially the dialogue between Edward and Bella. Now, the dialogue could have been over looked if the actors were able to deliver them. Alas, whoever decided to do casting for this film decided to cast every ""actor"" with the acting ability of a toaster. Now, a toaster is a inanimate object and therefore cannot act. Get the hint? What made me laugh the hardest was at the end of the movie when Bella's mother decides to inform Phil VIA TEXT MESSAGE that Bella is alright. I was so shocked that she was really texting him that I turned to my friend and whispered ""Bella's okay, L-O-L"". Really, though. Text messages? I would think that informing your potential spouse of your child's well being would warrant a phone call at least.Now, I have to point out the scene where Edward decides to flash Bella the goods. He want's to educate her in the ways of the vampire. He cannot go out into sunlight NOT because he'll burn or turn to dust, but because he turns into a failed children's art project. Reading the scene in the book I already knew whoever turned the book into a film was going to have issues with the scene. However, I really thought they'd aim for something above spraying Robert Pattinson with water then dumping craft store glitter on him. I didn't even notice the ""sparkles"" at first. My friend turned to me and commented ""The sun hits him and he gets gross and sweaty?"" because, let's face it, that's what he looked like. Damp and dirty. Oh baby, I can hardly contain myself! I could go on and nit pick at everything, but I'm just going to wrap it up and say this movie was awful and I'm disappointed in the screenwriter as well as the director. I feel like Hardwicke was too focused on making the mise-en-scene beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, which is all well and good, but in doing so she over looked her cast of actors who would probably get over looked at a high school play audition with the way they displayed their acting abilities in this movie. Though, maybe I take back the part of being disappointed in the screenwriter since you can only do so much with the source material you're handed.BRING ON THE TWILIGHT FANS!

The Merry Gentleman             ,simplybkuz,,crime,2009,5,"I really don't understand these reviews. Obviously, everyone has their own opinion and I guess I'm odd man out on this one. I found it to be incredibly slow most of the time. I saw a few of the key plot points coming a mile away.Seriously, the minute Frank showed up and heard about her ex being there, was there ANYONE in the theatre who didn't know Frank was about to go kill the ex? I mean ANYONE? Also, you knew the detective was going to catch on the second he saw Frank standing there. The second she fell with the Christmas tree.. in fact, no, the second it was clear that she was having trouble with the tree, you had to know Frank was going to end up showing up to help her out. The whole movie was entirely predictable. None of it exciting.It was a 110 minute movie that felt four hours long. I really wanted to like it before I sat down, but I seriously couldn't wait for it to end"
College Road Trip             ,eternalsea,1,adventure,2008,2,"Martin Lawrence is hardly the height of great cinematic performers, during the 90's the success of comics such as Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler prevented him from getting to many high profile movies, against the likes of Carrey who is actually funny, Lawrence just didn't represent that much of a Box-Office threat. Now that a lot of those dudes are attempting more serious films, Lawrence has recently had two films released in close quarters the passable Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins and this abomination. Basically the film sees Lawrence ferry his daughter around the country in order to help her find the perfect college with several other family members and assorted characters lagging behind. All are suitably ""crazy"" in that stupid Hollywood way, and Lawrence clearly sees himself as the star of this woeful effort, gurning and overacting his way through as many scenes as possible. Bottom line....the man ain't funny!!! A film similar to this was made not that long ago with Cedric The Entertainer called Jonson Family Vacation. It wasn't great but at least it had a few chuckle worthy moments, I don't think I was amused successfully once during College Road Trip, bar by the sheer poverty of imagination displayed by it's clearly juvenile screenwriters. The director is Roger Kumble who made the excellent Cruel Intentions just short of 10 years ago, and since has been gradually heading down hack road, he may have made a half credible film with Just Friends but 2002's The Sweetest Thing was simply not acceptable. However this is a new nadir for the man I once thought was at least semi-talented, here he directs with a bland eye and is clearly not enthusiastic about the product. Basically he wanted a bit of cash and this was the best way to get it. Comically inept and at times completely unwatchable College Road Trip is as weak a comic effort as I expect 2008 theatres will have to show, and should pop up quickly on DVD. It's an early but strong candidate for the years bottom 10, and may even be the ever irritating Lawrence's worst production to date. Sadly however one is almost certain it will enter the weekends top 5, and might even grab the coveted no.1 spot. Still when the reviews start flying it will drop fast like the dead weight it is. Avoid."
Lakeview Terrace             ,gazzalere,0,crime,2008,9,"I went to see this movie tonight, first of all I like Samuel L Jackson, whenever you go to watch his films you expect to see a good guy but this movie will give you a different feeling on this new character. From the films trailer you can kind of see Samuel L. Jackson as been picked to play the bad and rough cop in this film. Yes the film has a few racists one liners but at the end of the day it's the fact that this kind of thing really does happen in the world so that's what makes you take this film seriously instead of nip picking at the racism. The acting in this films i great, the plot works perfectly, a great thriller, probably the best thriller this year in my eyes.I just want to point out i'm not racist in any way at all, trust me there have been films with a lot more racism in than this but still well worth watching for a look at the world today."
Frozen River             ,alexkolokotronis,1,crime,2009,7,"Frozen River never even gets close to something of a positive tone. The movie is about a mother of two having her husband abandon them on 10 days before Christmas. To make matters worse the family is in dire straits needing money. As a result Melissa Leo, who plays the mother, begins to smuggle illegal immigrants across the border to make money.Melissa Leo's performance in this movie is very good but hard to watch. The movie is tough and shows poverty in American and in Indian reservations continuously. Her performance showed the desperation of a single mother and the price she will pay to get what she needs.The writing and directing of the movie was executed very well but I couldn't help but just have a bad feeling after the movie. I'm fine with negative movie but there seemed to be almost no hope for anyone in this film. Some stretches were of the film were dragging on but still a good film. If your in the mood watch this movie."
The Duchess             ,agmancuso,1,misc,2008,6,"The locations, specially Bath are the most cinematic aspect of this opportunistic tale. The Duchess, it seems, was a distant relative of Lady Diana Spencer's and there is a certain symmetry in their stories but Keira Knightly projects only an ""actressy"" air. She was superb in ""Pride and Prejudice"" but here she just simply poses and stares. Ralph Finnes's awful Duke is much more believable. The extra marital doomed love story between the Duchess and Dominic Cooper left me completely cold and perhaps that's were the problem resides. Their relationship, their ""love"" should have consumed us for the sketchy tale to work, but it didn't. Still, the locations, I repeat, are breathtaking and ""The Duchess"" can be seen if you don't expect to be other than an spectator."
Death Race             ,JWJanneck,0,action,2008,3,"The trailer seemed to suggest that this is another take on the Running Man theme. Actually, the original Death Race came out before the RM novel, but I did not see it, so I do not know how close the 2008 version is to the one from 1975. However, I do know that the main plot of the 2008 version is essentially identical to that of RM---a guy wrongfully imprisoned and exploited for his skills in some gladiator contest, this time with tank-like cars. The RM featured some over-the-top characters and action that was clearly tongue-in-cheek, and was essentially a media satire with an action theme. I interpreted Joan Allen's involvement as an indication that perhaps this would be an update of that idea.Turns out, I was wrong. This is not ""Running Man with cars"", it's Running Man with cars, no brains, no humor, in the form of a video game (including ridiculously video-gamish sensor pads that cars have to drive over to get ""weapons"" and ""shields""). Gone are any of the elements that could endear RM to a post-adolescent person, or anyone who can read and write: the media satire, the humor, the (mild) political angle. What is left is a lame-brained video game turned into a movie---I can almost see half of the audience manipulate imaginary game controllers in the cinema...In an online Q&A on mtv.com, the director has to face complaints about the lack of random killing of pedestrians, and does so by mounting a feeble defense around the observation that at least one person who left his car and was subsequently killed should count as a pedestrian, and that in his movie they went much further with the use of vehicle-mounted firearms. I suppose that kind of debate between the audience of a movie and its director is a fairly clear indication of just what to expect and not to expect from it.Another complaint in the same Q&A is that the trailer gives away the ""entire plot"" of the movie, in response to which Anderson reveals that he has seen the movie, and that it's not so. Well, I have seen it, and it is. The plot, of course, is paper-thin, and the fact that it can actually be revealed in its entirety in the trailer really says all you need to know about it. Plot is not what you should expect from this movie.But then what should you expect? It's not really funny (the funniest moment to me was when one of the characters discovers the essential uselessness of the co-pilots his creators have written into the script, and consequently throws out his co-pilot), it is not really sexy (all we get to see is a little bit Ms Martinez' cleavage---c'mon, if it's already R-rated, and considering the audience of adolescent boys on sugary caffeinated drinks, one could at least have thrown in some solid nudity, but no such luck), it's not funny, and the acting is non-existent (I can only hope for Ms Allen that this is the low-point of her career, and that things will be looking up from now on). It's really a ham-fistedly strung together collection of video-game sequences. If you own a game console, you could just put GTA or something like that in demo mode, and watch that instead. Saves you the annoying dialog and embarrassing attempts at plot as well."
Wendy and Lucy             ,MBunge,1,drama,2012,5,"After watching this film, I checked over the DVD features and found a text piece that described the work of filmmaker Kelly Reichardt as ""art with profound ambitions on a human scale"". Well, I don't know about what else Reichardt has done but you'd have to be one pretentious, ivory tower-livin' mofo to describe Wendy and Lucy as ""profoundly ambitious"". This is a very quiet, very slow, very naturalistic and extremely minimalistic 80 minutes of storytelling which eschews any sort of ambition, artistically or as entertainment. It's not poorly made and I suppose you could call it a success at what it's apparently trying to do. That purpose, though, has nothing to do with engaging the audience in any real way except to exploit the sentiments of dog lovers.Wendy (Michelle Williams) is a young woman making her way to Alaska for work, joined by her dog Lucy (Lucy the dog). Her POS car breaks down in an Oregon town and then Lucy goes missing, so Wendy spends the rest of the movie looking for her dog and trying to get the car fixed. Neither ends happily. The end.You may think I'm leaving something out of that synopsis but I'm really not. Reichardt's slice-of-life production simply follows this young woman along for a couple of days as she hangs onto the last rung of the economic ladder. Wendy does a lot of walking. She cleans herself in a convenience store bathroom. She makes a bed in the woods out of old sheets of cardboard. She befriends a Walgreen's parking lot security guard. And that's about it. We never know enough about Wendy to care about her for anything other than her missing dog. Nobody says very much. Nothing all that dramatic or comedic happens.If you hate dogs, you'll be bored out of your freakin' mind by this film. Unless you've lived a life that is totally insulated from the realities of working class existence in America and can view Wendy and Lucy as a cinematic safari into that environment, you'll be bored out of your freakin' mind by this film. Even fans of the lovely and talented Michelle Williams will be bored by this thing because she does little besides look forlorn, with about 30 seconds of abject misery thrown in.I mean, there's just nothing to this. The story is practically stillborn. The dialog is forgettable. The camera work is static and uneventful. Honestly, the majority of Wendy and Lucy feels like the deleted scenes that get cut out of a movie because they don't go anywhere or contribute anything to the story. Now, if this is the sort of thing you like, that's all well and good for you. Go ahead and wallow in the uninspired normality of it. But while I don't demand that every movie I watch have laser battles, topless chicks, kicks to the groin and a guy walking away as something explodes behind him, I do need more than what this motion picture is willing to give.This is not ambitious. This is small and limited and indifferent to anything outside of its narrow imagination. It would have been hard enough to sit through this as a 20 minute film festival entry. At four times that length, I'd bet most people never make it through Wendy and Lucy and I don't think they miss anything"

Milk             ,nehpetstephen,0,misc,2008,5,"Milk isn't a terrible movie--it's not even a bad movie--but it's nowhere near the level of gay masterpiece I hoped it would be. It's a conventional, unambiguous rallying cry with no real impact.Gus Van Sant has done some very original, highly stylized, downright weird films in the past decade. My Own Private Idaho was Shakespeare's world populated by gay prostitutes, with still life sex scenes and split screens and over-the-top dialogue; Psycho was a more surreal (and more scandalous) shot-for-shot replay of the Hitchcock original; Elephant was a hyper-realistic photograph of teenage violence starring no-name high school actors; and so on. His most conventional film was Good Will Hunting, but that at least was moving and had momentum, as well as a terrific soundtrack. Milk is just plain standard. Each character--though based on real people--can be summed up in a simple sentence, such as Emile Hirsch's Cleve Jones, the tenacious queer who... well, I don't even need a full sentence. That's about it.Sean Penn is convincing and sweet as the 40-year-old New York insurance man who realizes how boring his life is and decides to head west and make an impact. He seems to settle on a life of gay political activism simply because it's the most convenient; the attention, the theatrics, and the social bonding seem almost as important--if not more so--than the actual revolution.Which is an interesting idea, but not one that the movie really allows you to dwell on. Milk, with its fast-paced biopic structure (here's one important event... then here's another one a year later... then a close friend dies... and then there's a small triumph... and then...) and its attention to political activism, wants to be a cry for equality, not a complex, ambiguous character study. Harvey is reduced to the role of hero, champion, martyr. You're not allowed to be skeptical of his background, his relationships, his motivation, his manipulative methods. You know he's the good guy because he's on the side of equality--the ends justify the means and all that--and so you have to root for him, and that's that.But I don't enjoy that. I like rooting for villains. I like feeling sorry for the assholes. I like believing, even for just one turbulent moment, that what the psycho killer is saying makes perfect sense. And I can't stand a flawless hero. I can't stand being forced to side with someone.And as for Harvey Milk as portrayed in this film--well, he just wasn't that inspirational. Look, I'm queer and I'm liberal and all of that. It's a subject that's very close to me. Plus, I'm a sucker for inspiration, and I cry several times a year in movie theaters. But his speeches and his rallies never made me feel anything other than mildly interested on an intellectual level. The bad direction is part of that--the cinematography choices were dreadful, with very little camera-work standing out as exceptional. With each march and protest, a still camera looks head-on at the faces of the few stars as they march forward. Why? If we're supposed to be immersed in the riot, to feel like we're a part of it, why would be facing the rioters? Why would we be so still? Why not throw the camera into the action, shakily following behind the other marchers? But there's none of that.Maybe Van Sant was trying to prove that gay people are just as normal and boring as straight people, that their inspirational biopics can be just as color-by-numbers and boring as straight biopics. But who wants to see that? Harvey was loud--""My name is Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you!""--Harvey was theatrical. The gay movement at that time loved to shout out loud. So why such a stifling story?There's only one aspect of the film that's interesting, and that's the relationship between Harvey Milk and Dan White (Josh Brolin, in a fine performance), the straight-laced police officer and political rival. Their awkward dance is compelling--Dan ""the man"" tries to please and work with, however distantly, his minority colleague, while Harvey desires only to destroy the competitor who represents everything he detests and opposes. Dan keeps promises that Harvey breaks. Dan drunkenly stumbles in the shadows of his fading conservative beliefs--beliefs he doesn't even necessarily understand or trust anymore--while Harvey milks up the limelight. It's a sad and scary battle of wits, and one that paints a dark, political tinge on the otherwise spotless Harvey, but the theme is confined to a few short scenes and left largely unexplored.As a movie focusing strictly on Dan vs. Harvey, this could have been a good film, but by expanding this into an eight-year-long historical examination of how great San Francisco is and how wonderful and downtrodden gay people always are, the movie strays into the realm of simple, sweeping statements. I'm disappointed by how much critical acclaim this film is getting; aside from Penn and Brolin it's rather lackluster.Milk d: Gus Van Sant w: Dustin Lance Black (Sean Penn, Josh Brolin) 6/10"
Changeling             ,Chris Knipp,1,misc,2008,8,"'Changeling' has a lot going for it in the eyes of the public just being directed by Clint and starring Angelina. Moreover the little-known but true LA story it tells is heartrending. A hard-working single mother in 1928, Christine Collins (Jolie) is forced to work on Saturday in her job as an assistant supervisor at Pacific Telephone and she leaves her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home. When she comes back he's gone. Five months later the police produce her son, found in another state--only she denies it's her son. The LAPD's reputation is on the line, and they force Christine to take the boy home. Then they try to discredit her as a lazy and unfit mother when she keeps insisting the kid isn't hers. Eventually she tangles more and more with the LAPD, who're going through an especially lawless period under a corrupt chief. They've shot down a lot of criminals in cold blood and swept away the bodies--just so the Force can control all the crooked dealings in town. Their arch-enemy and leader of the public outcry against cop corruption is crusading minister Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who seizes upon the Collins case when it becomes public, smelling a rat. After Collins has repeatedly opposed the cops and refused to accept the boy delivered to her--who's three inches too short and circumcised, has different dental work and is unrecognized by his schoolteacher--a willful Irish Captain assigned to this case (Jeffrey Donovan) orders her locked away in a psych ward. A lurid story of child abductions emerges.'Changeling,' in the screenplay written by J. Michael Straczynski, is based on contemporary press accounts of what are called the ""Wineville Chicken Murders."" The mystery of Walter Collins' disappearance vies with the story of police corruption and the secret of the murders for attention, but Strazzynski wisely tells the tale from the viewpoint of Collins' mother, a kind of feminist heroine, since at a time when women tended to keep their mouths shut, she will not be silenced and never gives up. Some of the more gruesome details of the Wineville story are omitted, but sequences that go there still have a horror movie cast to them. The rest is a thriller-cum-police procedural with distinct period sociological elements. But there is skillful handling in the way a far-reaching story begins and ends with the intimate experience of a bereaved mother.Eastwood seems to have looked for a story on the order of Fincher's even lengthier 'Zodiac,' but the melodrama and focus on cop-crime in the material relate it to the James Ellroy-based films 'L.A. Confidential' and 'The Black Dahlia.' The psych-ward incarceration sequence takes you straight back to Samuel Fuller's 'Shock Corridor'--at which point things are beginning to seem pretty lurid, and the film almost as manipulative as Fuller's. Nonetheless the style has Eastwood's usual current elegance and clarity. Oxymoron it may seem, but this is lurid, yet (mostly) restrained. After all, this is a tale in which manipulation is being consciously looked at. In an interview at the NYFF, Eastwood pointed out that there was a link with movies like 'Gaslight' that deal with people trying to bend the minds of others: this is what the crooked cops try to force on Catherine, and they win to the extent that she takes the other boy home. And this is the most interesting and unusual aspect of the story.The acting is confident, if varied. There are a bunch of young boys who turn in strong, convincing performances, and as manipulative police captain and his chief, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore are reasonable, and Michael Kelley appealing as the good cop who unearths the kidnappings. Newcomer Jason Butler Harner gives a distinctive performance as the wigged-out killer, Gordon Northcott. Amy Ryan is typically strong as another victim of the cops' psych ward incarceration scam. Less successful is John Malkovich in Marcelled wig as the crusading religionist Rev.Briegleb: he just seems too mannered and creepy. Jolie is good, though her appearance is a bit strange: that huge mouth goes oddly with 20's hair styles. At one moment after she was out of the psych ward, I thought she might be locked up a second time--for overacting. Harner gets his chance to chew up the rug himself in his final scene. A little holding back would not have hurt.The film is outstanding in its period look; and good, if not perfect, in its period feel. If nothing else you'll remember Catherine Collins quaintly gong back and forth along the lone line of phone operators she supervises--on roller skates. Whole neighborhoods were restored by the filmmakers and streets filled with Model T's and, best of all, old trolley cars. The attempt at period lingo might have been more consistent; but that's a goal rarely achieved. Since the time scheme runs from 1928 to 1935, more mention of the Great Depression surely would also have been in order. Since the screenplay sticks to known facts, there is nothing about Jolie's character before or after the events. This is a good and watchable film, but not up to Eastwood's terrific 2003, 2004 and 2006 efforts. Presented as the mid-point film of the New York Film Festival, already well-publicized at Cannes, 'Changeling' opens nationwide October 31st. Eastwood has already directed two more films, one of which, 'Gran Torino,' he stars in. Even at 78, the man still seems virtually unstoppable."
Bedtime Stories             ,epdavea817,0,adventure,2008,9,"You Don't Mess With The Zohan? I thought it sucked. I'm sorry, I thought it did. It's only A (one) joke with A (one) punchline. Like, Did you hear the one about the Israeli assassin that wanted to become a hair dresser? Or, How do hairdressers do it? Why, silky smooth.Half of the movies he makes are either hit or miss. I didn't like Zohan, but I did like Click and Bedtime Stories. I liked the It's A Wonderful Life theme of Click. I kinda liked Splanglish, but it was just an awkward story. Bedtime Stories was just fun from start to finish. Kinda like The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates.I don't expect deep thoughts or philosophy from Adam Sandler. That's why I still haven't seen Reign Over Me.Bedtime Stories clicked and fired on all cylinders for me.I only wished I'd seen more of Monica Gellar, I mean, Courtney Cox. I'd go see a sequel."
Goodbye Solo             ,HamidK,0,drama,2008,10,"I watched this film at the London Film Festival, where the filmmaker has become a regular feature in recent years with his first two films 'Man Push Cart' and 'Chop Shop'.His third outing is his strongest work yet. The film communicates profound feelings and ideas through achingly powerful characterisation, finely nuanced storytelling and poetic visuals. I don't know how Bahrani achieved such brilliant performances from the cast, but Souleyman Sy Savane, Red West and Diana Franco Galindo all did something really special in this film.I will carefully touch upon the matter of the end of the film (avoiding spoilers).Bahrani has eschewed the manipulative beast that is 'the resolution' in his past films, in the name of truthfulness and integrity. As inspired as I have been by such choices, I said to myself two thirds into 'Goodbye Solo', ""this time, there has to be a resolution, right?""But what the filmmaker has done with the last ten minutes or so of the film is what I could only describe to my wife in the screening as discovering 'Cinema Gold'.The film navigates those of us who are willing to engage with the characters to a spiritual final stretch, where the viewer is no longer a passive participant, but thinking and feeling for the characters and about our own lives and those we love dearly.I could hardly breathe over the stirring guitar score over the end credits. I honestly can't remember when that last happened. Maybe it was 'Magnolia' or '21 Grams'.It's a perfect ending to a really powerful, moving piece of cinema - that must be seen again and again.'Goodbye Solo' is a truly engaging and emotional experience. The film furthers the great tradition of humanist cinema that masters such as Satyajit Ray, Ken Loach and Abbas Kiarostami have become legends pioneering. It is so hopeful that cinema-lovers of my generation can begin to look at Ramin Bahrani as a filmmaker with a talent and depth that exudes respect for the medium and towards those who love it.Find out where this film is showing and go and watch it, regardless of the 'kind of film' you think you like to see. From the first scene, you will feel welcomed, engaged, amused, challenged and moved. You will leave the screening when it's finished, but the film might not leave you for a long time."
The Bank Job             ,stephen-batty,0,crime,2008,7,"The film lives up to the posters on the underground a little sex, plenty of violence but it feels very true to the 70's, as I can remember the 1970's in London.The plot is interesting, funny in places and raises a lot of questions to which, we are very unlikely to get answers to in my lifetime! Can a government really behave in this fashion? My guess would be yes it can, as I am sure a lot of things happen of which, we are blissfully unaware! For those who remember ""The Sweeny"" on TV, I found the style quite similar.It is a good film but as it is a ""British"" film, you think they would know that Pinky and Perky were puppets and not cartoon pigs"
Changeling             ,yamar,1,misc,2008,8,"Clint Eastwood returns to ""Mystic River"" territory in this period piece that digs deeper into LAPD's past in corruption. Anybody who thought that LAPD's bad reputation is recent would be shocked to find that it was as bad in the 1920's. Angelina Jolie delivers a powerful performance as a wronged mother whose son disappears. To add insult to the injury she's further abused by the LAPD who instead of finding her missing son, trying to use her for their benefit. The film has some minor problems with its length and the overbearing score by Eastwood as well but hopefully it will get fixed before its release in the fall.

The Yellow Handkerchief             ,StephenTaylor,0,adventure,2011,7,"The word judgement, and its various forms, is repeated throughout this movie. I think that is really what this story is about. Brett tells Martine he worries about her because, ""you have no judgement."" The couple in the van ask Brett, ""Are you judging us?"" Maria Bello's character asks Brett, ""Are you judging me?"" for example. These characters are always judging someone, something, or some situation and then they have to try and understand the consequences of their judgement. All three characters are largely in the situations we find them in due to their judgement or lack of. And Kristen Stewart... wow!.... I am really looking forward to watching her talent/career develop over the next 20 years.....quite excitin"
Ghost Town             ,jaddison383,0,misc,2008,7,"Ricky Gervais, the star of the British ""The Office"" and ""Extras"", is someone you wouldn't really expect to be on the big screen. Yet here he is, delivering an hilarious and heartfelt performance in what one would usually consider the most clichéd of genres: the romantic comedy.In Ghost Town, Gervais plays Bertram Pincus, a socially awkward prick of a dentist who dies for seven minutes while going in for a routine colonoscopy. Through this miraculous experience he gains the annoying ability to see ghosts- all of whom want him to finish their business on Earth. In particular is Frank, the unfaithful husband of Gwen, a woman who lives in Bertram's building. Frank needs Bertram to separate Gwen from her new self-righteous do-gooder fiancé, and if Bertram can accomplish this Frank will make all the other ghosts go away.Greg Kinnear and the wonderful Tea Leoni round out the lead characters as Frank and Gwen. All three (Gervais, Kinnear, and Leoni) get big laughs and are utterly charming. Indeed, it is no overstatement to call Ghost Town riotously funny- the laughs come big and often. Too often it turns out, because when Ghost Town tries to stray into the more dramatic or tender areas of the story it feels somewhat awkward and forced. The mistake was made of focusing too much on broad hilarity, so that when the movie really attempts to focus on story it seems strange that the humor is suddenly gone. The film never becomes anything more than just a silly little trifle.Yet there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. What we get is a thoroughly entertaining tale with a fascinating lead character. Add in the performances of the three leads and you have a fully satisfying movie-going experience. I would probably give this film a 7.5 rating, but since that isn't allowed and I'm not feeling an 8, I'll go with- 7/10 stars!!! Jay Addison "
A Christmas Tale             ,Michael Fargo,1,comedy,2008,10,"It just doesn't get much better than this for fans of movie-making<U+0085>or fans of music, art, literature, philosophy<U+0085>even algebra? Arnaud Desplechin uses Robert Altman's impressionistic approach to film-making taking multiple characters, plots lines then adding Altman's playfulness with cinematic technique to dazzle the viewer with a rich mix of ideas and allusions. Watching, you just don't want it to end.The actors here<U+0097>as in Altman<U+0097>take center stage. Catherine Deneuve is the reluctant matriarch of some pretty messed-up siblings. We aren't ever clued in on the exact details of the rifts and jealousies. We just recognize them from our own family experiences. During an introduction to the cast of characters at the beginning of the film, the death of a young infant early in the family's history suggests that interpersonal problems will result, but it can't be the sole reason for the pathologies represented. As in life, it's never a simple thing to find the ""reason"" for conflict, unhappiness or even joy. We simply have to accept it and make the best of the situations before us. And this film is a wonderful demonstration of making the best of a real mess.There's not a weak link in the cast. And as the bizarre begin to assemble for a very strange Christmas homecoming the delight we feel for being onlookers instead of participants is palpable in the audience.I should warn that this is not a film in the tradition of ""Home Alone"" or ""A Christmas Story."" You may wait a long time for the Baby Jesus to arrive here (as the children on the screen do). It's more a film about family life and the peculiar kind of fulfillment we get from the strife that results. As with the ""ghost wolf"" in this family's basement, we're haunted by the familiar and the strange: it's both fearful and thrilling to see. And that's a very admirable accomplishment for Arnaud Desplechin."
Death Race             ,robertallenandersonjr,0,action,2008,10,"Death Race was a perfect movie in my opinion. It was action packed, bloody, gore, and even sexy. It was a lot of fun to watch. I really enjoyed this movie because the story was great and it had a lot of meaning. This was a great movie to start ending the summer with. The acting was very good. Jason Staham played a perfect role maybe his best role yet. Tyrese Gibson added a good performance as well. The stunts and driving that was performed in this movie was amazing. The visuals were so cool and so were the special effects. the movie really was entertaining and a wild ride from beginning to end. Just strap in and get ready for a really fun enjoyable action packed film. This movie holds nothing back it goes for it all. The blood was crazy and their were a ton of people dying. I also loved the originality of this film. I don't think there are to many maybe no movies that are anything like this movie. The title for this movie describes the movie perfectly. This was definitely worth seeing for a couple dollars. I will see it again and again. It is way better than what I was expecting it to be. It isn't boring for one second in the movie at all. Another great thing was the movie was very unpredictable. Twists and turns kept coming in every scene in the movie. The outcome was very good. Overall this movie was great and you will be very happy in the end after you see this movie."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,shadowycat,0,animation,2008,6,"As with the comment ahead of mine: it's all about the penguins. They should have their own movie.We were chanting: more penguins, more penguins. At the screening we just saw, people who loved the first Madagascar movie waited excitedly for the magic to begin... I LOVED the first one. Interesting note: I liked the first one better, but my BF thinks this one has a better and deeper plot and pointed out in particular that while in the first one Gloria (the hippo) was the butt of many fat jokes, in this one she is celebrated just for being beautiful.The whole movie is breathtakingly beautiful. We didn't see this on IMAX but I bet the IMAX version will be a treat.Sascha Baron Cohen's King is again the hands-down favorite, I heard a ripple of joy murmur through the theater at everything he said and did, although my personal favorites (after the Penguins) are Maurice and Mort, the King's cohorts.BF was also teasing me mercilessly because (and I'm nearly ashamed to admit it) there's one scene that had me totally teared up! Yes, I cried. Can't spoil it - go see the movie and tell me after if you know what choked me up! The film did not hold the attention of some of the very small children at the screening we saw, because some portions of the film only involve adult storyline concerning the adult star characters (Alec Baldwin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and so forth) but when the little characters are on screen (the baby lion in particular is DARLING) the children present were absolutely captivated.It's fun. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's very fun and children will want to watch it again and again. "
Stop-Loss             ,penandpaper52,0,drama,2008,5,"Caught this at the Canadian premier... Phillippe was there answering questions with the director and I was looking forward to something a lot more powerful than what I saw. The issue that it brought to light was definitely relevant, thought provoking, and powerful all on its own. The film, however, offered nothing new in the way of characters--meaning, we've seen this type of character in many other films, and they were often handled much better--and the story didn't really keep me entranced. Why? Because, the main issue, stop loss, was handled in a very one sided manner. The Q&A suggested that the director--and some in the audience--thought the issue really was played out in an open ended way, but really, it was just a bunch of policy bashing. Frankly, I agree with the films point of view, I just feel it loses all of it's meaning in how it was presented. Perhaps the cliché nature of so much of the confrontations hurt it for me as well. I didn't care about the life the characters were to leave behind, etc, etc...Saying all of this, the performances were good for the parts. Some of the dialogue was exceptional (some... it had its moments) and the scenes that actually took place in the war were astounding. On a last thought, the director made a point of explaining that a lot of the inspiration came from the fact that many soldiers these days video and photograph every aspect of their lives, and edit them together with music and share them with the world--cameras mounted on their cars, guns, etc---and so much of the war footage was displayed this way. Frankly, I was upset more of the film didn't take its inpiration from the same styling. "
Trucker             ,socrates99,1,drama,2010,NA,"And it is her movie though her kid in this movie is impeccable and as convincing as she is. I wonder what his age is. Oh well. Michelle does not attempt to maintain her looks as Diane Ford. Trucking is not an easy career and it would take a special kind of woman to do it. Knowing that Michelle actually learned how to drive an 18-wheeler for this part proving she is that kind of woman. In fact, she told herself that if she didn't learn how to drive that truck, she would refuse the part.That's astounding when you consider how good she is as an actor. The thing about good looking women is, many of them don't seem to have a real mind working behind the smile. Michelle leaves no doubt there's a mind there, and a real personality to contend with too. It's sheer enjoyment to watch her and she's in almost every frame. The reason is obvious, she is capable of moving the story along almost by herself.The story is fairly straight forward, mom deserts husband and son to live a life on the road, free to do as she likes. Years later she has to take temporary care of that son and finds herself succumbing to her maternal instincts. You see her thrash about unwilling to give up her freedom, but mostly it's a gradual disillusionment with her fairly empty life, despite the same sort of resistance coming from her boy.I enjoyed the movie a lot and haven't seen any actress do a better job bringing a character to life in years. It was quite impressive how well this new director was able to capture and enhance Michelle's performance. The Academy would be shooting itself in the foot if it didn't recognize Michelle for the rare resource that she is."
Julia             ,barbaramarliss,1,crime,2009,1,"I wish I could give it an F, as well.Tilda should not give up her day job with regard to American accents. Hers sucks. Totally lame. Then there's the film: stupid and predictable. Not hip. Not cool. Not edgy. Just Boring. Please don't waste any money like I did when I rented this OnDemand. It sucked. I had to force myself to watch it in its entirety.The whole plot line was disjointed. A big mess. None of the characters were at all interesting or sympathetic. The whole thing just reeked of ""ooh, this is so hip, just like a Tarantino film. Julia's so cool. A beautiful loser."" Zzzzzzzzzz. Snoozefest"
Garden Party             ,nogodnomasters,1,drama,2019,NA,"First off the picture on the front cover never appears in the movie, nor do all those characters enter a swimming pool. The title ""Garden Party"" comes from the Ricky Nelson song which is sung at a Garden Party. The movie centers around the sleazy Internet Porno traffickers, their clients, and users plus those who intersect with their lives. The characters in this film are human. They are neither all good nor all bad. Victims are not all victims and people who help you all want something, but only a few demand.Vinessa Shaw plays a real estate agent, Sally St. Clair (the box says LA, but the Hollywood sign is real prominent in the background). We find out she was once a stripper, who became a real estate agent. She helps street urchins, but demands their loyalty and hard work in return. She is ruthless and unethical in business and is not afraid to use her sex to get what she wants. Working for her is a Nebraska boy, who is unsure about his sexuality. He is mostly gay, but is confused. April is a 15 year old who runs away from her perverted step-dad who spies on her in the bathroom. He hasn't touched her, but she has to leave and will do anything to stay out of his home. She stays with some friends who are lesbians and works posing for Internet porn. Sammy, another street urchin is a gifted musician who stays with the semi-gay Nebraskan until is he is discovered. There is also a pervert who constantly downloads Internet porn who stalks, then hooks up with Sally and helps her get her nude pictures removed from the Internet. This loosely ties them to other characters in the story.The music is excellent. There is just one nude scene near the beginning. At times the movie seems like it is soft porno without the nudity. Excessive pot use. The movie, like a Ricky Nelson song is light in spite of the sleazy situations and all ends wel"
Shutter             ,bababear,0,horror,2008,8,"This was a surprisingly good, old fashioned ghost story.I haven't seen the original and I'm not a fanboy, so I didn't have any axes to grind going in. The cast is very good if somewhat underutilized, the photography and musical scoring are excellent, and there's a plot twist that caught me completely by surprise.Watching the previews you'd think this was the one millionth Asian horror with a vengeful female spirit who has long black hair and dark circles under her eyes. There's more than that going on here.And, without giving any plot points away, the final shot of the film is going to stay with me for a long, long time.Sure, this isn't the most original piece of work ever. It's part of a long tradition of ghost stories. But the makers had the sense to keep it to 85 minutes so it's over before you really begin to think how familiar some of the material is. 1"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,daveygandthekeyboard,0,action,2008,5,"All I can really conclude about this movie is that it was just okay. I can forgive the ludicrous plot, the cheesy ""family"" dynamic of the film, the fact that Harrison Ford is old (which is really nowhere near the worst part of this). I don't even really mind Shia LaBeouf's presence. But many of the stunts and the action scenes are so implausible that it renders all of the action scenes implausible. For example, Shia LaBoeuf sword-fighting (!) spread-eagled on two moving vehicles; a boat going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls with absolutely no one getting a scratch (I mean, what are we watching here, The A-Team?); and the ""if the film hasn't jumped the shark yet it certainly has now"" moment--Shia LaBoeuf swinging through the jungle a la Tarzan. It was ridiculous. And because these parts are (forgive my overuse of the word) implausible, it highlights the fact that the rest of it doesn't work, either. After seeing a number of old series trying to come back for another run (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, the Star Wars Prequels) I have concluded that when filmmakers attempt to cash in on a once-popular series, artistically the best they can hope for is to break even. Sometimes there really is nowhere to go but down. I wanted to love this, but the most charitable thing I can say is that it was just okay. Very disappointing. 3"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,KissEnglishPasto,0,crime,2013,NA,".............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL NO SPOILERS HERE! My wife, Carmen, and I saw 11 films at the 2009 Orlando Film Festival. Three TITLES were truly exceptional: HERE and THERE, The CRIMSON MASK and TERRIBLY HAPPY. This Danish film noir/psychological thriller deftly redefines Creepy.Others have compared HAPPY to several films. From the depths of the ID comes this relatively obscure comparative reference: Think DEAD and BURIED (1981)...sans Zombies! If you like predictable, you most definitely don't want to watch HAPPY. Each and every time HAPPY comes to an A) B) C) or D) multiple-choice crossroads juncture pivotal point, it consistently offers the viewer NONE Of The ABOVE as the appropriate thread option! At the heart of HAPPYs appeal: A deliciously intriguing and universally cross-cultural screenplay/story by Director Henrik Ruben Genz and Dunja Gry Jensen. Hearsay has it Copenhagen cop Robert (Jakob Cedergren, in an amazing but tautly low-key characterization) completely lost it a few months back when he caught his wife in bed with his partner/best friend. He drew his service hand-gun, waved it around threateningly at the philandering pair, but never really got beyond a little saber-rattling...Except for firing off a round into the ceiling. This was enough for 3 months treatment in a loony bin.Upon release, the force prudently decided it best to send Robert to the apparently idyllic small, out of the way, town of Skarrild, far from the Capital, where Nothing ever happens! A bit slow-moving at the onset, HAPPY soon dishes out one plot twist after another. When it isn't creeping you out...Happy is busy pulling the rug out from under your proverbials! With great ensemble performances, this little Danish film comes highly recommended...Just be forewarned: The ONLY TERRIBLY HAPPY people associated with this production are the viewers!9*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!

The Burning Plain             ,sundance7490,1,misc,2009,9,"I had recently become a fan of both Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's work through their previous four films Amores Perros, 21 Grams, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and Babel (in order of release). In hearing of their creative break-up, it certainly stirred, in my own mind, a possibility of double the good films... or a film-making battle accomplishing nothing. ""The Burning Plain"" by Guillermo Arriaga is the first of these fruits. Good or bad? You decide. I think good... but missing something.The Burning Plain follows the story of several different people separated by time and space -- Sylvia, a woman in Oregon who must undertake an emotional odyssey to rid herself of her past; Mariana and Santiago, two teenagers trying to piece together the shattered lives of their parents in a New Mexico border town; Maria, a little girl who goes on a border-crossing voyage to help her parents find redemption, forgiveness, and love; and Gina and Nick, a couple who must deal with an intense and clandestine affair... because they are both married.Charlize Theron leads the ensemble cast. Theron, I have previously seen in a consortium of roles from Sleepwalking and Monster to The Italian Job. I am glad to say she brings a much more subtle feeling to Sylvia, the central character in the film, without going over the top. The sides we see from the past and present also reflect Sylvia's personality; a side of professionalism brought in by a new skin in the present while her not-forgotten past hiding deep within but brought out by her sexual trysts and self-mutilation.Also leading the present side of the story is newcomer Tessa Ia in a challenging role she takes at face value despite her young age. With Mexican actor Jose Maria Yazpik in a gentle role, along with Theron, the three are arguably the best actors in the film. Ia's performances hails true talent and not nearly enough credit. With a fierce look in the eyes of a child trying to obtain forgiveness in her own soul, Ia is an actress mature beyond her years. The present stories take on these subtleties that audiences will figure out after the film has ended. This is where the second half (figuratively speaking) of the film suffers.Focused too much of what is going on in a certain time in the past, the characters of Gina and Nick suffer due to a lack of development. We know of their affair, we know what is going on and we are given too much of that without enough understanding of who they are on their own. Kim Basinger does her best in the role but ultimately is too flat with her delivery. Gina is a sympathetic character because of the screenplay and where the writing takes her, not because of Basinger's performance. Joaquim de Almeida's Nick is more interesting despite a lack of screen time, also due to the lack of development.The story of Mariana and Santiago is much better because it escapes from this problem and we are given a beginning, middle and end to their story (per se). JD Pardo gives a nice understanding to Santiago and allows for a much better look at the character as an adult when you finally realize who it is (I will not give anything away). However, Jennifer Lawrence as Mariana is probably my most disliked actor of the group. Despite winning the best newcomer award at the Venice Film Festival, her delivery is monotone and lacks any sort of true feeling for what has happened. This also counts for in between two sections of her life... but a nice reaction to a certain event ultimately saved her entire performance.The film has amazing undertones that audiences won't figure out until later. There are several different themes played on such as the theme of love which is included not only through relationships, though this is the main ingredient, but from children to parents, siblings, and great friendships. The latter is what genuinely seals this aspect of the film as Jose Maria Yazpik and Robin Tunney's characters bring their perspective leads to a connection. Another underlying theme was that of scars. Whether through self-mutilation or a past surgery, Sylvia, Santiago, Mariana, Maria, and Gina all end up with (literal) scars by the end of the film that they cannot forget about eluding to the main theme of the film that the past effects the present.I was hoping that it wouldn't be just a carbon copy of what Inarritu has done before (in an attempt to win an audience). I felt the same way about Three Burials which is why I have rated it with only 8. This is going to be the first major problem for Arriaga on his own creative path. While unfortunate, it is inevitable: audiences will go in expecting the same intense fair Innaritu has been giving them and will see a more tame version of that. Luckily, the wonderful production values and gorgeous cinematography by veteran Robert Elswit and John Toll, tacked on with a beautiful soundtrack, ultimately send the story flying.With a number of events occurring through the story, you are never left bored. Piecing together the puzzle isn't really as difficult as it may seem. For Babel it was all about figuring out which story was in what time period. In The Burning Plain it's about who is who and how time has taken it's toll on the characters, which makes it much more interesting in a more creative way. This is where direction suffers as it is obvious Guillermo Arriaga was more focused on the story than he was his actors, but it all falls together without disrupting anything. Hopefully the creative split will allow audiences to realize there is a large difference between directors and Arriaga and Innaritu are no exception."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,Sinistar_8085,1,drama,2009,1,"There are dozens of really great movies that have been made. Sadly,this is NOT one of them. For one,this movie suffers from the usual and overused ""abusive father and kind-hearted gentle mother who wouldn't hurt a fly"" cliché,a hateful cliché that's been spreading like wildfire over the decades.Another thing that ruined this movie for me was the terrible over-acting done by the performers. As usual,the man overdid his anger and the woman overdid her panicked terrified screaming,a combo that would give ANY person a terrible migraine.A lot of wonderful Hollywood performers wasted their talents in this god-awful,migraine inducing dud.Were they so desperate for money that they agreed to embarrass themselves in this so called ""movie""? Sadly,yes.I got the feeling that this movie was made just to make the director richer.I do NOT recommend this ""movie"" to ANYONE. Instead,go watch a REAL movie like ""Casablanca"" or "" Brokeback mountain"" or even a W.C. Fields movie-these are wonderful alternatives to ""Sewcret Life of Bees""."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,Bond00719,,animation,2008,NA,"Great movie for the whole family. There is no crude jokes or swearing! Has a witty plot and lovable characters. I only wish the movie had more songs. VeggieTales movies usually have lots of songs! Anyway, it's still is a wholesome, clever and cute little film. There was even some jokes that adults could only get, like gags about the ""Love Boat"" and stuff. But, it didn't have Bob the Tomato, in the movie until the very end. That was too bad because Bob is my favorite character. My favorite part is at the end when the ""Rock Monster"" music video plays. It's really funny. Overall, I recommend this film for anyone who wants to see a harmless and witty movie about talking vegetables. Enjo"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,cbreiss,0,drama,2008,1,"This movie was a cheat. Very poor, unrealistic story, characters undeveloped and unmotivated. Felt nothing for any of the characters. None of then had any strength or character or integrity. Julia Roberts, as actor and character, totally disappoints. The story line leaves many questions to be resolved. Why was Jane staying with the family? How long was Michael separated from his wife? Why did anyone accept the father's horrific behavior and never call him on it? Not reasonable that no one would confront him and that the movie gives you the impression of happily ever after. In short, the movie was totally unsatisfying on all levels and actually made me mad."
Righteous Kill             ,Lechuguilla,0,crime,2008,6,"Turk (Robert De Niro) and Rooster (Al Pacino) are longtime NYC police partners, in this Jon Avnet thriller that has them trying to stop an unknown serial killer, a person who leaves a poem at the scene of each crime. Victims are law-breakers who were freed on legal technicalities. Two other cops, played by John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg, become suspicious of the investigation, and this hampers the efforts of Turk and Rooster.The script on which the film is based is rather poor. The setup is muddled; none of the characters are especially sympathetic, and secondary characters are not well defined. Further, ""Righteous Kill"" is not that much different from other serial killer or urban crime films.The mood here is dark, and the tone is rather cynical. Characters go out of their way to telegraph their toughness by using lots of ""hard"" language. There's an edginess to the characters, and that's okay. But I could have wished for a character with some degree of softness. That would have provided much needed balance to the overall tonal savagery.Without a doubt, the film's best element is the acting. There's not a weak performance in the bunch. Of course, the focus is on De Niro and Pacino. This is really their film. And it's their camaraderie, their back and forth playful banter, that makes the film worth watching. Production design and costumes are credible. Color cinematography is generally dark, consistent with the story's mood.In spite of a weak script, ""Righteous Kill"" does provide some good plot misdirection that will leave viewers unsure as to the story's outcome. But the film's main virtue is the casting of De Niro and Pacino, two contemporary screen legends whose performances here are quite good. 1"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,Not the Guy From Clerks,0,action,2008,4,"Visually, with Henry Jones Junior (he is rarely called ""Indiana"" or ""Indy"" in this film) swimming in his baggy grandpa pants and shocks of grey-white hair peeking out under an ever-crisp, rarely-dirty brown fedora, you really don't get the feeling that you're watching anything historic--but a few of the old John Williams refrains drive something primal bubbling to the surface of those of us who grew up idolizing Indy.The reason that the music is the first thing to be examined here, is that it's one of very few things that evoked that sort of reaction in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A movie fraught with missteps and an obvious misunderstanding of its own audience, it's exactly the type of summer blockbuster developed to make money at all costs: things blow up; there's aliens and Nazis--well, not Nazis so much as Russians with grey shirts and jackboots; an unnecessary youthful sidekick (to bring in the teenagers, you see); and a little something extra borrowed from Bryan Singer's abominable Superman Returns. To ascertain that you know it's a Spielberg picture, the Russians are never subtitled (see also: every Arab in Munich or about 90% of all Germans in any film except Schindler's List); this way, the ""evil"" characters can be thoroughly and literally dehumanized.The film oozes 1950s--Russian spies, nuclear testing, a screening of Howdy Doody and Dr. Jones on a sort of academic blacklist all take place in the first ten-or-so minutes of the picture (as does<U+0097>sad to say the high point of the film for me<U+0097>a cameo appearance by Neil Flynn, a friend of Ford's from The Fugitive who is best known for his portrayal of The Janitor on ABC sitcom Scrubs). The filmmakers have discussed at length how, while the earlier Jones films were an attempt to capture the magic of '30s and '40s adventure films with a contemporary feel, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will be a '50s-style action romp with some science-fiction sensibility thrown in for good measure (a questionable choice to start, as many of those films eventually ended up as Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder). In an attempt to capture that feel, you have some campy dialogue, some stock characters and Shia LaBoeuf as Arthur Fonzerelli. There's a fairly generic soda fountain brawl, initiated by LaBoeuf and set to the tune of Shake, Rattle & Roll, which solidly plants this film in its era. This is an interesting artistic choice because in the previous Indy films, even with their date stamps, the adventures that took place were largely relatively timeless.The other aspect of the film that is bound to turn some heads--it already has, both in pre-screenings and on the Internet as eagle-eyed fans dissected the trailers--is the role that extra-terrestrials play in the picture. As in Spielberg's classic Close Encounters of the Third Kind, there is no dialogue, as such, shared between man and his visitors...but their presence is strong and pervasive, particularly in the second half of the film. Using Roswell as a jumping-off point, it is revealed that the good Dr. Jones has been used as a government agent in a variety of capacities since we last caught up with him--he is a Colonel in the Army, apparently, and also has worked with the CIA, MI6 and as a spy against the Russians in the time since Hitler autographed his father's diary for him in the early '40s.The adventure sequences in the picture are hit-or-miss; while some of the car chases and fight sequences are good, and a lot of the side jokes are on the mark, there are times (Marion is injured while driving, but mysteriously gets better) that it's hard to follow visually what's going on as they try to pack too many characters and subplots into a fast-moving sequence. Many of Harrison Ford's comic moments are on-target, but other diversions<U+0097>such a CGI-rendered prairie dogs and LaBoeuf's own private army of monkeys<U+0097>bring to mind some of the more artistically-questionable moments of Return of the Jedi and detract from the seriousness of consequences faced by our protagonists.Dr. Jones also doesn't get very much solo screen time. Henry himself has also become a little more cautious in his old age, while everyone around him seems to have become more like Indiana Jones. Mutt and Marion are decisive and powerful figures, while Indy often finds himself sitting on the back of a motorcycle or behind them in the car, shouting, ""No, don't do that! It's dangerous!"" As action heroes go, Indy has been turned into a great family man. In case a CIA agent of dubious allegiances, a kidnapped ex-girlfriend and her tagalong son weren't baggage enough, Indy spends most of the film carting around an octogenarian in a semi-catatonic state, who may be the ""key"" to finding the Lost City of Gold in the same way that his father was key to the recovery of the Holy Grail.Ultimately, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a film that, while not entirely bad, is nowhere near worthy of its lofty pedigree. As generic action films go, it may have provided some level of entertainment in the vein of National Treasure....It's the attachment of ""Indiana Jones"" to the title and the involvement of Harrison Ford, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg that raised expectations and standards to a level that none of those individuals<U+0097>each a shadow of his former self<U+0097>can meet any longer. It will doubtlessly open at #1 and secure the kind of critical and financial success that guarantee it a sequel if all involved want to make one<U+0097>the question, really, is whether or not they should. 4"
Stop-Loss             ,phantomtristan,0,drama,2008,7,"Director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Don't Cry"") brings another powerfully charged film of such raw emotion that upon later reflection of the movie I felt like I had witnessed real events.Stop-Loss follows the fictional story of a soldier, Brandon King (Ryan Philippe), who has returned home after a tour in Iraq. His contract is up and he just about to get out when he is stop-lossed (a ""fine-print"" section in all soldiers' contracts that gives the President the power to extended soldier's contracts in time of war). He refuses to be shipped back to Iraq, and goes AWOL in search of his state's senator for help. What follows is his road trip to fight the stop-loss as well as showing the devastating affects his fellow soldiers (Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experience from the horrible war. Its' acting, directing, and writing had such a feeling of authenticity, and combined with the fact that 81,000 of our brave soldiers have already been stop-lossed since Spetember 11,2001, this film feels like a true story.One thing that made this film succeed so well was it's director was a woman, and she was able to make a movie were you could feel and see the emotions these guys were feeling even as they would desperately try and mask them.The acting was extraordinary from the three main soldiers, most notably Ryan Philippe who is so gritty and real in his performance that he seems like he actually is a marine. Channing Tatum gives a genuine performance, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's is the most haunting of the trio as a soldier who fights his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with excessive amounts of booze and slowly slips into a deep hole of despair.This films is not a propaganda piece, it simply portrays something that is going on right now. It brings up many good points, but never bashes you with a certain viewpoint but leaves it to you to decide. This is such emotionally powerful, deeply moving film, the best film I have seen since the year started, and destined to be one of my favorites from this year. "
The Express             ,manny-97,,misc,2008,7,"""The Express"" tells the gripping true-to-life tale of Ernie Davis. He's the first African-American who won the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual honor. At a glance, you may think ""The Express"" is just another football film, but what sets this movie apart is its resonant theme of courage and hope amidst racism.Racism is the key to Davis' discovery of his athletic abilities as a child. Faced with danger from the neighborhood bullies, all white, Davis escapes his tormentors by running as fast as he can. From that point on, the boy who can barely speak because of his stuttering problems is able to express himself on the football field.Actor Rob Brown plays the grown-up Davis with much aplomb. Brown has such an aura of openness that his performance pulls you in. The actor landed his first acting job in ""Finding Forrester"" because he thought he could be an extra in the movie so he could pay his cell phone bill. The rawness in his acting he showed in that film sparring with Sean Connery is evident in ""The Express."" Only this time, Brown is wrangling with Dennis Quaid.Quaid stars as Ben Schwartzwalder, a long-time coach at Syracuse University. Schwartzwalder discovered another gridiron icon, Jim Brown (played in the movie by Darrin Dewitt Henson), and he is the one who will eventually mold Davis into a football hero.""The Express"" can be seen as a two-character morality play between Davis and Schwartzwalder. The football scenes are great, but much of the action happens between the clashing coach and his esteemed player.If Davis is a symbol of the civil rights campaign during the 1960s, Schwartzwalder is the metaphor for the evolving conscience of America. In the beginning of the movie, Schwartzwalder appears to have only one goal in mind <U+0096> winning. But towards the end, with Davis' help, Schwartzwalder learns the true meaning of victory.Brown and Quaid are enough to justify the price of your movie ticket, but ""The Express"" is blessed with indelible supporting performances. Heading the pack is Charles S. Dutton as Davis' grandfather. His likability matches Brown's. Another notable performance comes from Omar Benson Miller as Davis' best friend, Jack Buckley. His acting transcends the comic relief nature of the character. However, the lack of strong female characters mars an otherwise perfect acting ensemble.Based on the book by Robert Gallagher called ""The Elmira Express"" (the Elmira in the title comes from Davis' hometown, Elmira, NY) with a script written by Charles Leavitt, I liked that the topic of racism did not consume the film. There are some lines that are a bit overhanded, but the actors deliver them with much gusto.One of my favorite lines from the movie is the one Schwartzwalder used to inspire his team during their historic Cotton Bowl game against the University of Texas in Dallas. Met by intense heckling brought by racism, Quaid, in a powerful dramatic moment, delivers the dialog, ""do not let them take history away from you."" That line reverberates strong and well to this day.Directed by Gary Fleder (""Runaway Jury""), you don't have to like football to enjoy the movie. You will stand up and cheer during the intense football scenes, but you will clap even more for Ernie Davis' unprecedented journey. And for that, ""The Express"" gets 3 Touchdown kiss"
Julia             ,weeelfie,1,crime,2008,9,"I could not like this film more. Yes, it's messy. Yes, it's extreme... but it is precisely for these reasons that I adore it. In this age of one slick, bland, impeccably crafted and neutered blockbuster suppository after the other and at a time when so-called independent films are so often just show reels for wanna-be future suppository crafters, this is a breath of pure, animalistic, delightfully anarchic, fresh air. It is truly cinematic, ambitious, original and brilliant. The dialogue is a bit weak in places and it feels like it was edited in a rush, but those are my only complaints. Swintons performance is full of fantasy and compassion and anyone who has ever spent time around hard-core drinkers will know that it is 100% realistic. The entire experience of watching this film is like a binge weekend for the viewer: All threads unravel, reason becomes skewed and when sobriety finally kicks in, you are left with nothing. I was swept along in a complete state of reverie and found myself breathless and wishing it could go on longer when it ended. The colourful mix of characters and landscapes are beautifully framed and lit. The whole thing is like a bizarre European fairytale of what America is like. Oscars for best Actress and cinematography please!"
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,Jeannieg,0,misc,2008,8,"This is a film of two parts - something which a previous comment didn't really make clear - we see the events of Italy during Andreotti's reign in the first half from Andreoti's point of view: then in the second half we see the same events again from (depending on your perspective) either a more dispassionate or a more disparaging observation.As a bit of cinema it is brilliant (one or two IMO rather silly unslick bits of special FX, just ignore them!) but altogether not to be missed. I doubt that it will translate well, and even for a seasoned appassionato of Italian politics the introduction of characters using (clever) superimposed text was flawed by the overshort screen time which these important notes were allowed."
Good Dick             ,IvanDonadic,1,misc,2010,10,"I just watched this movie a 2nd time and once again I really liked it. My rant here is going to be for people who obviously didn't get the movie at all. I read one review where they say ""characters are bleak and underdeveloped with no explanation for how or why they are the way they are"". What? It is so abundantly transparent (SPOILER ALERT) that the main female character was sexually abused as a child. There are so many scenes to corroborate this HUGE element of the film. How did people not get this? I just have to stop and read the positive reviews because it really does get me vexed when people who clearly do not have a morsel of understanding review a film negatively due to their lack of comprehension. I say rent ""Heroes"" if you don't feel like delving slightly deeper than the surface. I apologize for the rant. Here is the positive: Well written, well acted with some really beautiful shots. As soon as you begin to follow the main female character's story, it does give you an uneasy feeling, which I believe is obviously intentional due to the harsh subject matter. However, that feeling quickly subsides with an innocence and a relentless devotion that the main male character embodies. Balanced with harsh themes juxtaposed with genuine, substantial love. Nice. That said, I didn't think that the film was a ""10"" necessarily, but I felt compelled to neutralize some of unfair negative reviews. Oh well, ""sue me... Twice"

Untraceable             ,sataft-2,1,crime,2008,10,"First of all, even with a scant few trivial character actions that were a tad bit questionable, this film is absolutely - EXCELLENT! How can I say that? Well my wife and I usually get through our bag of popcorn within the first quarter of a film. This time, however, when the film ended we had almost a half bag left - uneaten.No, it wasn't disgust from anything depicted in the film, it was simply that the film grabbed our attention and virtually never let go.Now, who am I? Well, I am a scientist and my wife is a British midwife. Yes, we are computer competent and that may be a key element. We are also in our sixties - that may also be another key element.However, it is my opinion that most of the reviews written here (with the bare exception of the first one), were written by a generation that doesn't really know what terror is. They have been raised by so much simulated on screen violence and fake blood, that virtually nothing scares them anymore.However again, as a technical consultant, I have traveled to over 30 countries and worked in some brutal and godforsaken areas and witnessed incredible brutality.Trust me people, there are very scary things and situation in the real world and this film reveals, quite brilliantly, the rapid evolution of one of them within our own society.For those of you who were not a ""bit"" frightened, what the hell film did you view?"
Kung Fu Panda             ,the-movie-guy,0,animation,2008,8,"(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.(My Comment) This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po ultimately learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. Jack Black (Po) and Dustin Hoffman (Shifu) voices were just right for their parts, and the chopstick fight between them is fantastic. Ian McShane (Tai Lung) was also wonderful as the villain, and his battle sequence on the rope bridge is spectacular. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. (DreamWorks, Run Time 1:28, Rated PG) "
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,fomafomic,0,misc,2008,9,"This is a great movie about a controversial, damned and tragic figure of Italian political world of the last 50 years, touching some of his notorious, never fully clarified trials as landmarks of career. A comedy, realized half as a subjective view of the facts, half as a conventional comedy narrative incorporating other known characters of the period. The deeply narcissistic, subtle and ambiguous nature of Andreotti is outlined with sharpness and sarcasm. You can only speak his ""humanity"" like Sorvillo does here, if you'd know the subject for many years as Italians do. This wonderfully acted and written great movie speaks to people who lived or know those years close, who have an idea of the period called ""first republic"", the years of the Cold War and terrorism in Italy. Servillo's acting is worth the film alone, but all the great actors around him are perfect and clearly highly enjoying the project.Curiosity: if you have seen The Godfather Pt.3; ""Il Divo"" Giulio Andreotti is the bad Italian guy close to Vatican, fighting old Corleone Al Pacino... too bad Andreotti would never had been killed or clearly seen taking a position so unconfortable no way. This film is high art compared to that movie, though; this must be said."

Adoration             ,Jackpollins,0,drama,2009,2,"The new drama, Adoration is a confusing drama/thriller about a high school student named Simon (Devon Bostick) who tells his class his mother's husband, and his father put her on a plane with a bomb. He is now living with his uncle, Tom (Scott Speedman), a tow-truck driver. Simon's teacher, Sabine (Arsinee Khanjian) gets her car towed by Tom. She then realizes it is Simon's uncle. There is another plot in which Simon debates in an online chat room via webcam that debates what they think of Simon's view on his father. The two main plots don't seem to have anything in common with the other. This makes the movie have an illogical feeling. I didn't understand why Simon listens to these people tell him that he's right or wrong about his view on his father. He does not seem to think it is an open subject, and yet he's telling a lot of people (some of whom he does not know well if at all) this story. Why was his teacher so intrigued by his story to the point of basic interviewing Simon's uncle? I admit, Bostick is better than I expected for a young actor, but he's playing a character I've seen 3,000 times. I also can admit I think this is a good idea what they're trying to do. That does not save the movie. They never answered important questions like Is Simon telling the truth or making up a story?, and What is with these chatroom people? I just wanted them to answer these questions, but they even fail to do that. Skip it"
Wendy and Lucy             ,Benedict_Cumberbatch,1,drama,2008,NA,"Kelly Reichardt's (""Old Joy"") new film holds our interest for its 80 running minutes thanks to Michelle Williams's captivating performance.The story of Wendy (Williams), who hits the road with her dog Lucy intending to get to Alaska and start a new life, is too vague and minimalist to work as a feature. As a character study, it's underwritten; as a social commentary on our current crisis, it's too shallow and naïve. Had Reichardt gone deeper into any of these directions, her movie would be much more interesting; the way it is, it feels like one of those shorts that went on for too long when they could've been more concise. Maverick filmmaker Todd Haynes (""Velvet Goldmine"", ""Far from Heaven"", ""I'm Not There."") and the promising Phil Morrison (director of the sublime ""Junebug"") are some of the movie's producers, which shows Reichardt has her own admirers. Let's just hope that, next time, she finishes her job. 5.5/10."
WALL·E             ,michael11391,0,animation,2008,10,"Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!! 3"
The Objective             ,rishi_is_here-1,,horror,2008,6,"I just didn't get it, it started so promising. It has created all the supernatural sensations during the first half, added with very good acting and pretty good cinematography. But then it loses. Mainly because nobody would understand what is the objective of the soldiers who are following a horror trail in middle of nowhere. I would say its a perfect example of very bad story telling where you created all the attention and then just don't deliver it. The end is so disappointing, what did it mean? Is the guy still living and in a trauma center or he died. What is it that they were following in the entire movie? Well it may be shrouded with mystery and director may keep it for the audience to think on , but then at least give something to think on.It will get marks only for its low budget but good direction except the end, good acting , tight conversation and creating the tension."

Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,FakeIDs,1,comedy,2008,4,"To be honest, I didn't think Forgetting Sarah Marshall was much better or worse than The Heartbreak Kid. I think I laughed during the pediatrician scene and one other part that I can't remember. The characters are just a collection of stereotypes...and they are not even up-to-date stereotypes! Surfers that have smoked themselves into a stupor are way eighties, dudes. I think Paul Rudd, whom I like, knew his character was just another variation of Spicoli and phones it in a little. A weepy Emo rocker or even an angry white rapper would've been more contemporary than a sex-obsessed British rock star. You would have to go back decades to find a musical artist that even remotely resembles him. They even miss chances to poke fun at real-life personalities. Sarah Marshall could have been one of those boozy ingénues that flash their privates as they get out of limos.Supporting characters are unnecessarily inserted into the story and eventually forgotten, but they don't even provide an excuse for a clever joke. There is a Christian couple on their honeymoon that are completely pointless and they lead to some of the worst gags in the movie. All you are left with is something that is going to potentially insult a large group of people and you didn't even get a single laugh out of it. Jonah Hill and his infatuation with the rock star goes nowhere and is not particularly funny. The other characters have become all-too-familiar in a romantic comedy. The too-good-to-be-true romantic interest. The henpecked husband and friend of the hero. Et cetera.There was a stand-up comedian on the talk show circuit a few years back who would make a joke about how people will get tattoos of symbols in foreign languages that have no meaning, like the Japanese kanji for ""water."" They shoehorn the joke into the film by having it spoken by an airhead who is suddenly translating tattoos in other languages. Maybe Carlos Mencia contributed to the movie?When Judd Apatow produced a good comedy show, ""Freaks & Geeks,"" it was largely ignored by the public and was quickly canceled after one season. When he started appealing to the lowest common denominator, the same people were suddenly his biggest fans and praised him. You start to see why ""That 70's Show"" lasted 8 seasons and why ""Two and a Half Men"" is entering its sixth. Meanwhile, ""Arrested Development"" barely makes it to 3. Almost every opportunity and set-up the movie has to do something clever, they take the easy and predictable route. I was actually surprised by how many of the jokes were just plain cheesy. The only thing you can say in defense of such a shallow movie is that it is comparatively better than Disaster Movie or Good Luck Chuck, but that should not impress anyone. You would almost have to be trying to make a worse comedy than those. It is like when people orgasm because gas prices fall a little, but they are still paying more than they should. People are becoming conditioned to bad comedy.And, yes, there is a token ethnic guy."
Shutter             ,b014422,0,horror,2008,6,"After seeing this movie, I was shocked by the comments. The movie wasn't that bad at all. In the beginning I wasn't sure what to think. It was rather scary, and the plot itself made my question whether I saw this movie or not already. It reminded me of similar movies like the grudge.But let's face it, the end was surprising and not in any way predictable.I like the movie. I'll see it again someday. I gave it a six because it was very entertaining, surprising, but it wont go into history as a masterpiece.See this movie if you want to enjoy yourself, be scared, be excited and you wont regret it."
Hancock             ,luke-346,0,action,2008,4,"Hancock began life as a good idea and with a very intriguing premise; it bills itself as the alternative superhero film by aiming to show that the Superhero can be humanized. The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock, played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man (Jason Bateman), who is married to the lovely Mary (Charlize Theron) and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.The film starts well by introducing us to Hancock asleep, scruffy and unshaven on a public bench but ultimately establishing him as a lousy, grumpy oaf. As the film progresses Hancock evolves into a very endearing character, his apathy and self loathing - exhibited by his alcoholism, are all traits that manage to humanize the myths that surround super human beings. The fact that his physical prowess and lifestyle choice is his undoing is an interesting concept and in some quarters would be regarded as a microcosm of the manner in which gifted, black American men have been marginalized over the years (but this is a short review and I don't want to get that deep... however, examples that come to mind, and help to support this theory, are such great physical talents like Ed Moses, Shaquille O'Neil, Carl Lewis, Jesse Owen etc) some film scholars will no doubt give more precedence to this side of the film.Many critics have labeled the film as being unequal and disjointed and I would have to say that I agree. The first half of the film is amusing, engaging and quite plausible (given its premise) but upon the introduction of a second hero with equal powers the film quickly descends into the farcical. For example, some of the early scenes have Hancock exhibiting his strength in often mundane scenarios from dragging a car up a driveway to dunking a basketball from over 50 meters away but given there placement in the context of the film they are clearly the conceivable actions of a super strong human being. During the latter stages of the film this demonstration of strength becomes inane and coarse, epitomized by a scene in which the two superheroes battle it out the sky, throwing each other across blocks and through buildings, and affecting the weather to such an extent that lightening, twisters and snowfall all takes place. This is ultimately where the film falls down as it resorts to the clichés that are so often witnessed in films of this genre. Ultimately this decline is driven by a foolishly executed back-story that has no place in the film and should have been erased the moment it was conceived. The internal logic of the film is preposterous and nonsensical and would remain so even if it was chief plot device in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.When it comes to the direction it seems surprising to me that Peter Berg should be able to make the leap to making a blockbuster like Hancock, this is because Hancock was always going to be a commercial risk given its target audience and release date and his previous film The Kingdom was not a huge success. In these situations it is normally an established director that is chosen by the studio to carry films of this nature. This is evident from the manner in which the plot, story and narrative transpire to the screen as Berg's direction is gritty, with frantic zooms, sharp fast-pans and steady-cam sequences. His direction does not really complement the film, leading me to believe that in Hancock we have a director that is better than the film he is trying to make, a rarity in film making but it does happen.Finally, Hancock is probably one of the biggest let downs I have had the misfortune to witness this year. The incoherent story has seriously affected the outcome of this film; it has led to it being almost incomprehensible. The futile subplot and unnecessary twist laid the foundations for the films demise. However, despite my immense disappointment I can still sit back and take light in the performances and the direction, but they can do nothing for my overall feelings towards Hancock."
Frost/Nixon             ,IMDb-627,0,misc,2008,9,"I had the pleasure of watching this gripping movie at the opening night of the British Film festival. Ron Howard's direction and story telling ability are in top form with this effort. From the very first scene a carefully crafted and very credible 70s's atmosphere sets a solid stage for the superbly cast film and quickly transports the viewer into the political jungle that was ""Tricky Dickey's"" playground.The acting duo of Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen (Nixon & Frost) are set on a collision course that finds two deeply passionate personalities at the mercy of their insatiable desires. Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language, pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed, the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life (read intimacy) into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.Make no mistake, this is by no means a two man show, quite the contrary. In fact, the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould, Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who, brick by brick, constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure, constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan, who has, without question, penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history, but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.Not to be missed, this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction.

The Women             ,cecif,1,comedy,2008,3,"This film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or Ms. English tried). Assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. English's experience - according to her IMDb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! She has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one helped Ms. English get the changes & updates or subtleties right. If only she (as writer, director AND producer) had reached out for some assistance, I think it could have been good. But it was not.It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time & money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: ""Let's remake a classic with worse everything!"""
Kisses             ,Tahwan,1,drama,2012,NA,"The acting of the kids was really good. They were portrayed realistic, which made out most of the charm. Yet, in the end, the movie got a little unrealistic turn into somewhat like an action movie, which was definitely unnecessary (except they ran out of ideas). It seemed to me, as if the director wanted to show that he can shoot also action-scenes. All in all the ideas were a little few, which were also not completely new. The supporting characters did not have much originality. Especially the ending was little bit too conventional and foreseeable. Portray of two kids was great, yet the story lacked of originality and ideas. Since the movie is just 78min long, it's worth watchin"
The Duchess             ,ekartawick,1,misc,2008,9,"After reading copious amounts of mediocre reviews for ""The duchess"", I wasn't expecting much from this film. However, from the first scene I was utterly absorbed.The film isn't ""just another period drama"", it is an absolutely beautiful and heart-rendering tale of the tribulations faced by Georgian woman. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who although is the key character in the film (as you can probably infer from the title), represents the situation of all woman belonging to a patriarchal society, not just the aristocracy.Keira knightly is exemplary in this role. Her facial expression tells more than a script ever could. I enjoyed her performance in ""atonement"" but this was in a whole new league. Ralph Fiennes was also excellent. My best advice is to ignore the critics and come to your own conclusion. My only negative criticism was the rapidity with which Georgiana bonded so intimately with Bess. However, I don't know enough about the social context of the time to really make a judgement.All in all, a deeply moving tale that shouldn't be neglected. 1"
Bolt             ,intimidate38,0,animation,2008,9,"Over the past few years Disney track record in new movies has been questionable. With the exception of Meet the Robinsons (which I quite liked), Disney has done nothing but pump out rehashed ideas in the form of inane sequels to classics loved by my generation or weak under developed characters. Well not this time. I managed to see an advanced screening of this tonight with my daughter and it had both of us highly entertained. Bolt the ""super"" dog was full of funny and emotional characters the likes of which Disney has not produced in a while. And for once the comic relief characters, of which there are many, did their jobs and pulled even the slowest of moments out of the trash and send you rolling in the aisles. Rhino the hamster was my personal favorite. After seeing this movie all my daughter could say was how awesome it was and ask if we could see it again. I had to remind her that it actually does not come out until next week. Well to sum it up I would recommend to children young and old and while I have not seen it yet in 3D I plan too because it was easy to see that 3D is going to make the movie even more exciting."
Gran Torino             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,drama,2008,NA,"I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them, and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). Still, something felt off about ""Gran Torino"" based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be 'badass' again, trying to be Dirty Harry again. ""Gran Torino"" is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry, and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry (it's a stretch), but he is a distinctive, memorable character on his own, and I'd go as far as saying that it's one of Eastwood's finest performances, and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.I'm not going to argue that ""Gran Torino"" has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn't. In fact, some of them are downright bad at times, but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind (I am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous, something that isn't being captured well enough in advertising. It's absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense, fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood's tour-de-force direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.Whether or not ""Gran Torino"" will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all, you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet, but Eastwood's beautiful, nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which I won't discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it's really fun to watch this movie unfold, Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood's image. I don't mean that as a negative, it just adds to the film's strength as a character study.It's a more intimate film than Eastwood's other film this year, ""Changeling"", and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films, but it's just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around, it is a film about a man who, near the end of his life, is forced to confront his demons, and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. By the end of ""Gran Torino"" I had forgiven any flaws it might have, and was completely satisfied with the film, which far exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling that ""Gran Torino"", which has already been met with strongly positive reviews (but is still being described as a 'minor' Eastwood film by some), will eventually become an especially important part of Eastwood's filmography. 6"
Lakeview Terrace             ,BeetleDouche,0,crime,2008,7,"When i saw the trailer for this movie i immediately compared it to ""pacific heights"" which stars Michael Keaton and is a favorite movie of mine, i am not a fan of Samuel L Jackson i have never really enjoyed his work and the few movies he has been in lately including ""the cleaner"" did not help my view on his acting, so going into this movie i was determined i would not like it and i was wrong , the first thing i want to clear up is this isn't like the movie i compared it to, it deals with racism but from the other end which i have never seen before in a movie, And secondly Samule L Jackson does great in this role as a cop with a grudge, the story is more than what you would think and the trailers did not give anything away, it is not a complicated movie with twists but it is a movie that is different from previous films with this type of aim. the fact that i am not a fan of Samuel L Jackson yet i praise him for this role shows how much quality this movie has. Patrick Wilson also does a great job , he is a good actor and its a good warm up role for people to know his face in his next role in ""watchmen"".The rest of the cast do a good job in there supporting roles. This by far is not a movie that will win any Oscars but it is a movie that will entertain, i recommend it for a Saturday night in with drinks. A very entertaining thriller with great acting from its two leading actors. I hope my review was help full and if you get the chance to see this take it, because it will not disappoint."
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,lorpim,1,misc,2009,7,"Good movie. Girls have grown up, more mature. Once again included conflicts many teens face. Loved the filming in Turkey. Thought Tibby's problem was a bit grown-up for the movie although that happens to many girls at that age. Could have had a better guy play the role of Carmen's love interest. Blake Lively had the best performance out of everyone. Great acting between her and her grandmother. Was disappointed when Lena went back to Kostas and left Leo but if her heart wasn't into it then you can't do anything about that. Thought it was insane how Effy was going out with Bryan. That was real dumb. Loved the ending when the girls jumped into the water in Greece and then watched the sunset but was I upset to learn the pants were not found. May mean no third movie.

The Bank Job             ,Harbinger70,0,crime,2008,10,"I expected this movie to be somewhat entertaining, and maybe a bit cheesy. After all, it's not difficult to muck up a heist movie. However, this film gets it all right. The acting is top notch, the story is not only engaging and clever but TRUE (!), and the experience of seeing it is thoroughly enjoyable.The only complaints I have of the film are that the characters do get a little cheeky from time to time (but hey, they're British, so it's kind of expected), and there's a couple flashbacks/lapses in time that are initially confusing - although everything is clearly laid out about halfway through. Want to see a good movie? Check this one out! 1"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,Drewmac09,0,animation,2008,4,"Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3d animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Didn't Bug's Life also do that? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I'm saying before they go and use that as there logo. Also, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a ""theater"" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flyes were. I liked IQ. I agree with animaster, they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure. I recommend it to families and kids"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,Ali_John_Catterall,1,misc,2009,9,"Pre-9/11 and the 'war on terror', you'd be forgiven for assuming that international terrorism was some kind of super-outré lifestyle choice, with its own clothing line, cool accessories and an endless supply of kidnap victims on tap. The only drawbacks: being banged up for a couple of decades or, at the very worst, individually picked off by special forces (although if you were a male terrorist you had even more of a fighting chance, as everyone knew they always shot the women first).At least, that's the impression you might take away from The Baader Meinhof Complex, during an exchange between a pair of sexy, second generation RAF (Red Army Faction) recruits and a Middle Eastern fixer. ""We can invade the US Embassy in Kuwait - or there's the possibility we can hijack a Lufthansa plane,"" their agent casually suggests, as if he were a maître d' presenting two different restaurant menus to a couple of lovebirds on a dinner date. (In the event, the RAF picks the plane platter with hostages to go.) So although it would be nuts (given how the central characters wind up) to accuse The Baader Meinhof Complex of glamourising terrorism or playing fast and loose with the facts, the film could certainly be mistaken for trading in radical chic, dealing as it does with a young, hip, disproportionately middle-class organisation, much given to Bonnie And Clyde-style posturing and gunplay.The filmmakers can also hardly be blamed for the fact that quite a few of Germany's most wanted were ridiculously good looking in real life, and they've cast accordingly. If Germany's film directors were in thrall to US counterculture during the 1970s, so too were its activists - headline stars of their own imagined movies. That young terrorist strutting down the quaking aisles of the Lufthansa jet in 1977 is modelling a very iconic Che t-shirt. While Andreas Baader, co-founder of the RAF, was no stranger to make-up, false eyelashes and tight trousers without underwear, the better to show off that 'arsch'. Even a Jordanian training camp is treated like an 18-30 holiday with sub-machine guns.Substitute those guns for guitars and this could almost be the biopic of a rock band, from early hits to mid-period mismanagement and fatal fall-outs over direction and differences. And, naturally, everybody chain smokes throughout. Even an emaciated hunger striker valiantly puffs away while dying on his back.Initially, it is perhaps more instructive to say what this film is not. It is not some soul-searching blockbuster about good people who do bad things; it is no Munich. These would-be heroes of the people are pitiless killers, spitting scattershot rhetoric as their Heckler & Koch MP5's rain ammunition on those imperialist running dogs and anyone else who gets in the line of fire.Neither is this film any kind of comprehensive field guide to the RAF; the sprawling cast often come and go without namechecks, introductions or backstories. Momentum, not digression, is key. Nor, after nearly two-and-a-half-hours of dense history, does the film, one of the coldest and least sentimental of the German new wave, wrap with some tidy, poignant resolution; it climaxes with an awful, spiteful gunshot ringing out in a middle of a forest.Instead, The Baader Meinhof Complex, based on Stefan Aust's non-fiction study, is a brutally honest, totally uncompromising and utterly gripping depiction of exactly what happened in the ten years between June 1967 - when police shot dead a protester during a state visit to Germany by the Shah of Iran - to October 1977, when abducted industrialist and former Nazi Hanns-Martin Schleyer was executed in revenge for the suicides of imprisoned RAF leaders Ensslin, Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe.Our escort into the underworld is the left-wing journalist and mother-of-two Ulrike Meinhof (Gedeck) who goes from reporting the news to making it. Her snap decision to leap from an open window to join Gudrun Ensslin (Wokalek) and Baader (Bleibtreu) on the run during a prison break is as significant as Chief Broom's in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Once through that window, there is no absolutely no return home. Paranoia, madness and suicide follows. Who'd be a terrorist? While the film doesn't flinch from showing precisely what a car bomb does to the human body, neither does it shy away from depicting the tedium of drifting from one safe house to the next in the company of angry neurotics.There is not the slightest shred of hero-worship or sympathy for these left-wing idealists-turned-neo-Nazis: Baader is portrayed as a reckless, idiotic poseur (""Only a gun makes it fun!"" he exclaims to a young disciple), Ensslin, a manipulative tyrant, and Meinhof, an icy propagandist (""A man in uniform is a pig, and of course it's okay to shoot him""). All the cast is superb, but Gedeck and Wokalek as the catfighting frump and firebrand are standout.It has its flaws: this is a film of two halves, and once the architects of the RAF have been incarcerated in Stammheim prison, the film's momentum cannot help but be somewhat railroaded. As if to compensate, the movement's second generation, including the drop-dead gorgeous Brigitte Mohnhaupt (Uhl), ramp up the bloodletting with ever more ferocity, until the film finally topples over as if through sheer exhaustion.The soundtrack could also have been chosen with more care; what precisely is the significance of Janis Joplin singing ""Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz"" over the opening credits, aside from the fact it's a German make of car? Meanwhile, Bob Dylan's 'Blowin' In The Wind' is an altogether too mimsy lyric to finish this film with, after what's preceded it. Surely Dylan's 'My Back Pages' is the most obvious choice - ""In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach/Fearing not I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach"

I wished there had been more of the brother.The costumes also should win something, anything. They were amazing and really stood out.All in all it was a a pretty good movie.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,BiiivAL,0,animation,2018,8,"What can I say about the new chapters of the great saga of the ""Far-distant Galaxy""?To say that it is amazing, that it is exciting and that it is fascinating - means to say nothing.The series seemed to have poured new blood into the Star Wars. And now the fact that I was impressed with him:1. Clones ... for the first time in the history of the series (including numerous comic books, books, games and individual stories) the clones showed LIVE! From now on, these are not soulless faceless machines for murders. These are ordinary people, just like you or me. They also think, they experience, they feel and feel fear. For the first time in the history of the series, my heart bleeds when another soldier settles on the ground with a black hole in white mandororian armor. Each clone is like a brother and at the same time is incredibly unique. This is shown especially well in the series (it seems first, but perhaps the memory changes me), where Master Yoda with a bunch of clones had to make his way to the ruler of no-remember-what-planet to conclude a contract before Darth Tiranus (Count Dooku in the common people). It is there that the great Yoda reveals to each of his brothers his uniqueness.2. Music. Well ... what can I say. The music of John Williams is, of course, good. But ... it is a little outdated (in my case - fed up). In addition, it absolutely does not approach the action, which unfolds in the series. Kevin Kainer was able not only to create an atmosphere of what is happening. His compositions literally tell us what's happening on the screen, perfectly fitting into the picture (although it would have been perfectly listened to without it).3. Graphics. Many scold this series and full-length for the graphic component. I do not know about you, but I liked it. And George Lucas, too. In one of his interviews, he said that he specifically decided to use just such a graphic style.4. Humor. A good deal of sound humor is also there. If someone says that the droids joke flatly and in a way that is not funny, then do not believe this person, because most likely he does not have a sense of humor, or he did not hear, but learned about it from the stories of one deaf-mute (yes forgive me these people, for I did not mean anything insulting). If many of the droid's phrases are simply ridiculous, then some make you literally cry with laughter.5. The plot. I'm delighted that I can finally see what happened during the clone war, so I'll add it to this list.6. Action. Neither in a fairy tale, nor describe with a pen. Such brutal battle scenes you have never seen, and camera work just blows the roof) Music adds effect.Bottom line: what do we get as a result? A grinding blend that is svezhakom in the saga.But the most important thing here is the mapping of clones. The number of Jedi here is quite understandable, since this is the series of fighters in white armor. Honestly, I would gladly have looked at all six episodes again if they were re-released in the same style."

Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,DonFishies,0,animation,2008,2,"It hurts me, physically, to say I disliked Star Wars: The Clone Wars. I may not like to think it, but I have always been a Star Wars fanboy, right from the moment I first lay eyes on Return of the Jedi. I was never a huge fan of the TV series, but it did not seem too bad when I did see it. Apparently, I should have been looking closer.Star Wars: The Clone Wars as anyone could guess, follows Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi during their stints as ""army generals"" during the infamous Clone Wars. In the film, Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter) is given a Padawan learner, the feisty Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein), and given the mission of rescuing Jabba the Hutt's son. He has been kidnapped, and in exchange for his safe return, Jabba will aid the Republic during the war. But obviously, the job will not be that easy.Saying Star Wars: The Clone Wars mocks the very fabrics of the Star Wars franchise does not even begin to explain how horrendous this movie is. Take just about everything you could have disliked about the new trilogy (and even things you may have from the original trilogy), and it probably will not even come close to the destructive nature George Lucas have brought us with this film (and subsequent new series).For one thing, it seems that the casual one-liners of the series have been amped up to being used every other sentence. All this new Ahsoka character brings to the table, other than a lightsaber-sized gash through the heart of continuity, are giggling one-liners. She even has a nickname for Skywalker that she proceeds to use every time she is not calling him Master (and for an even more inexplicable reason, he has one for her). And then she has a name for R2-D2 and Jabba's son as well ('Stinky', which seems to be the only name he is ever really referred to as). I realize that Star Wars was never one for being perfect with their dialogue, but save for Jar Jar Binks (who does not make any appearances in the film), I do not think I have ever been more annoyed by any character more than this one. It is like the writers (who surprisingly are not Lucas) did away with anything we have learned about Jedis, and gave us this irritating wise-ass. Sure there was a cuteness to her character, but she loses that after about five minutes of screen time.Even worse, the Battle Droids just seem to be here for comic relief. I was always under the belief they just spoke their directives. But somehow, someway, they actually talk to each other, and say the most ridiculous things to each other. Oh yeah, they may be funny for a six-year-old, but for anyone else, they are absolutely agonizing. At one point, one says ""Shut up!"" to another one, and you can almost hear the sound millions of fanboys make when a piece of their childhood has withered away and died. And if neither the Padawan or the Droids do it, then surely Ziro the Hutt (voiced by Corey Burton), Jabba's uncle will. Remember John Waters' friend and muse, Divine? Ziro is nearly the splitting image (albeit, an obese and disgusting slug).The story is also an issue here. It is just, not strong enough to sustain a film. It does not necessarily feel like a three-part arc of the TV show (although the bizarre opening ""crawl"" read off by a Saturday morning announcer sure does not help that ideal), but it also does not feel like a completely well thought out film either. Sure, it has the political intrigue about Jabba's son's kidnapping, but this is supposed to be a Clone Wars movie. People come to see the Clone Wars. So why is all the meaty story elements being pumped into a throwaway story about a baby slug the main characters keep referring to as 'Stinky'? It just screams bad story writing, and essentially, makes the film need to stand beside the show, instead of as its own separate movie. I can only hope that it will fit in better there, as opposed to needing to stand beside the theatrical films here.I will say, for all of its continuity ruining, terrible one-liners, silly storyline, and lack of John Williams themed music (I could not believe it either), there are some very well animated action sequences. In some cases, whether I like to admit it or not, some of the scenes look spot-on with the look of Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith, even to the point of the Battle Droids and Clone Troopers looking nearly perfect to their real life incarnations. Yes, the human characters look a little weird (especially anyone with hair, or a beard), but everything else looks very good, and very close to what they did in the movies. The animation here is not as exquisitely detailed as the likes of a Pixar movie, but it never aims to imitate them. As well, even though the likes of Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor are not doing voice work in the film, the voice actors have made a genuine attempt to have their voices sound similar. The result is much more astounding than I could have imagined, and almost made me forget they were not the real thing.In the end, Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a kids movie, or at least, can be appreciated by children. It has the whiz-bang battles of a Star Wars movie, but the humour and ADD-infused dialogue that they can appreciate from the cartoons they watch on Saturday morning. If you are not a child however, it may just ruin any childhood memory you had of this once legendary series.2.5/10. 1"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,crazychap,0,action,2008,7,"In the summer of 1981, best friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (the directors of Jaws and Star Wars, respectively) made a tribute based on the classic cliffhanger serials of the 1930s with a Bond-like feel. That ""tribute"" was Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it was an action adventure film that surpassed all expectations, becoming the box office champion of 1981 and nominated for many awards, including BEST Picture (a rarity for action films), solidified the career of the already-famous Harrison Ford and put Karen Allen on the map. Set in 1936, with World War II waiting just below the surface, archaeology professor and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the US government to find and retrieve the Lost Ark of the Covenant while facing fierce competition from the Nazis, who are aided by a rival archaeologist.Two sequels would follow, 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (actually a prequel, as it takes place in 1935) and 1989's Last Crusade (set in 1938). Both sequels were great box-office draws, but both received a comparatively less favourable critical reception, especially Temple of Doom, which stirred up a lot of outrage for its portrayal of an Indian Cult. All three movies took place in the immediate pre-World War II era, before the war machine erupted in autumn 1939.Now, It is 1957, and things have surely changed. It has been 19 years since the end of the Last Crusade (which also coincide with the gap between the films' release dates); World War II ended with the defeat of Dr. Jones's traditional enemy, the Nazis (from Raiders and Crusade); close friend Marcus Brody (Elliot McDermott) and father Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) have recently passed away; the new international order is split between the Communist world v.s the Capitalist world (with everything in between) and Indy is trailed by the FBI (and also by the KGB) due to Mac's, his longtime partner, history as a double-agent and Jones's recent forced cooperation with the Soviets to find a warehouse that includes captured artifacts (which coincidentally includes the Ark). While trying to leave the country temporarily to escape the FBI, he encounters a young man named Mutt Williams, a rebellious drop-out in the likes of James Dean and Marlon Brando. He persuades Jones to come with him and help rescue his mother, who turns out to be Indy's lingering flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and Professor Oxley (Hurt), both held captive by the same Soviets Indy has encountered early on. Indy reluctantly agrees, and decides to help him battle the Soviets in a race reminiscent of the Last Crusade, except that it is set in South America.Surely, all these years have created a lot of hype over the Indiana Jones movies, and to tell you the truth, this movie lives up to most of it. On the positive side, Harrison Ford is impressively fit (both physically and mentally) as Indy and is every inch as likable now as he was back then, the action sequences are top-notch, and for the most part, done without the infamous CGI, the special effects are very good, and it's very good to see Karen Allen, my personal favourite of the Jones ladies (and for most, I might say), return in this movie. The moments of humour are effective, and the movie's fast pace never lets up for a minute. The plot twist between Indy, Marion, and Mutt (whose real name is Henry Jones III) is a grabber.On the flip side, the screenplay has a number of gaps and unfinished ideas. First of all, there is almost no back-story shown about what has Indy done through all this time other than spoken dialogue, but most importantly, the Soviets are portrayed in an unfairly stereotypical manner, making them essentially the Nazis of the past films with a hammer and sickle. Cate Blanchett's character, Irina Spalko isn't well written despite the actress's convincing portrayal, and her Soviet grunts are just stock. Mac (Winstone) makes some great comic relief, but I find his double-triple agent subplot too far-fetched, even for spy-story standards.All in all, this movie reminds me of what action movies are all about: a temporary escape hub from our drab everyday lives, plenty of slam-bang, explosions, stunts, exotic locations, the whole shebang. And this movie meets all the requirements. Crystal Skull may pale when compared to Raiders and the Last Crusade, I personally find it better than the mercilessly dark and gloomy Temple of Doom. The movie may be flawed, but you'll surely be entertained from the first scene down to the end credits.Originally, Indiana Jones was meant to be a five-picture deal. With this movie, the deal is just one film short of completion. I can't wait for the sequel!"
Pride and Glory             ,DarkVulcan29,,crime,2008,9,"Pride and Glory manages to reach such high depth of entertainment, in which it shows the effectiveness of the good guys and the bad guys. It may seem like another type of mystery drama, but it goes beyond that.It begins in December, where Ray(Edward Norton), a missing persons police detective, and his older brother Francis(Noah Emmerich) are at a football game where the cops and the firemen are playing against each other. There brother in law Jimmy(Colin Farrell) who is also a cop, is playing also. But after the game, Francis gets a call, about a shoot out. When Francis, Ray and Jimmy arrive at the scene, they find it was a drug bust that went horribly wrong, and four cops are dead. Francis Sr(Jon Voight) a retired cop, suggest that Ray should come in on this case. Ray has a troubled past, but agrees to come on. But during the investigation, what there gonna discover is something not only shocking then the crime itself, but the events that led up to it.Terrific performances by Voight, Emmerich, Norton, and Farrell. The crime drama is also great. It seemed to slow down a little for some parts. But I liked the direction it was going, it showed the gritty realness of a cops life. It just wasn't focused on the crime part, but also on the emotion part. It was a great film, don't miss it."
Milk             ,greg-253,0,misc,2008,9,"Just caught the Portland premiere and have a few thoughts.Very thankful this film was made. Until now, it seemed like I was fairly alone in knowing about Harvey's legacy. After ""Milk"" starts getting attention....I hope that a whole new generation will come to know the Mayor of Castro Street (see Randy Shilt's book) and the importance of the gay rights movement.That being said, Van Sant's ""Milk"" is great marriage of art and history. Instead of a dry portrait of an assasinated leader, we get a beautifully rendered flavor of the times, and an intimate vision of a man finding his place within a community and history. Casting is brilliant. Penn inhabits Harvey Milk in a way that few actors I believe would be capable. His physicality and energy is very believable - and it's easy to forget what actor you're watching. After a while...it's just Harvey. I could go on about the supporting cast...all very solid in their own way. James Franco (Scotty) stands out as well....showing his range and willingness to expand as an actor.Kudos all the way around...I see this film getting several nods at Oscar time.Additionally...Rob Epstein's Oscar-winning 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is a definite must for anyone who enjoyed this film. I watched it right after ""Milk"" - and am still impressed with how affecting it is. 1"
The Escapist             ,hjw-6,,crime,2008,10,"Only a handful of films have ever been awarded a 10/10 for me - this is one of them.Having been given the chance to read the script by Rupert a couple of years ago, when the film was in preproduction and looking for filming locations, I have been waiting for this film for a long time knowing how much potential it had - never have I been so gripped by a movie script on first reading.Oh boy, I wasn't disappointed. Wyatt delivered the story big time, for me. I went to see it last night on the first showing in Cardiff and enjoyed it so much that I went with a friend this afternoon to see it again. My friend also agrees with my feelings! I can understand how some people may find it confusing (especially in the first 15 minutes) but I think by the end, when all the pieces fit together, it's a classic.Having seen it the second time now, there is SO much detail I missed the first time (some of which my friend actually spotted on the first watch).This film ticks all the boxes for me. Strong characters played by talented actors. A complex but ultimately rewarding plot. An intense and superb soundtrack (needs to be seen in a cinema with good surround - I jumped several times at ""normal"" ambient noises coming from various places around the auditorium). The music is just perfect for the film.Even now, I feel I want to go and see it again to see what other clues have been left in the storyline to subtly point to the payoff at the end of the film."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,robert-broerse,0,drama,2008,4,"The disappointment I feel is perhaps more for David Fincher's career than this film. Everything on the surface of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' appears beautiful - the cinematography, the special effects, the make-up, the cast... everything is about eye candy. It is sweet but like sweets containing high glucose corn syrup, it leaves one irritable and certainly dissatisfied. I find with most critiques of mainstream, big budget films those who fall into two camps - those taken in by the hype, by the surface of the film and those who feel and understand the film, aware of its flaws. It is the same with bestseller novels. First of all, the concept of this film was unique. Let us at least take notice of F.Scott Fitzgerald who may or may not have stolen the idea/material from his wife Zelda (whom many scholars believe was the true genius and not her husband). Origins aside, the film has all the trimmings of previous work. There are some people who are vehement about this being 'not Forest Gump'. I would stress the similarities between the two films and the fact Eric Roth wrote both. Let us take note of the obvious:Atypical hero: Forest Gump/Benjamin Button Love Interest Jenny/Daisy Mother (with similar accents) Hero's 'war involvement' Vietnam War/WWII Setting American South/American South Leitmotif Feather/HummingbirdThere are others but those are the most obvious. Let us also remind ourselves both films are narrated by the hero who both happen to have interesting and 'profound' observations about life and their lives. But if it were simply a matter of being Forest Gump, then I would still have high praise for Benjamin Button. Not so. The majority of this film remains on the surface. Despite all the observations, despite the epic sweep of events that pass through the narrative, we as an audience are rarely allowed to go deeper. Again, the film was based on a unique idea but without the human psychology, without more background on several characters, I found it difficult to relate to any of these characters. Benjamin Button. He is born old, he grows young. That's all we really know. He lives with old people, he learns to play the piano, he leaves home, he travels, he sees the world. Most of the narrative is about places and meeting people, rarely about being involved with others, what it means or feels like to relate to a world that sees him as old. He is an outsider. How does this feel? We don't really know as an audience. The film is entirely experiential, rarely psychological. Daisy. We know she had a grandmother. We knows she loves to dance. But little else. What motivated her to dance, why did she love dancing? We don't know. And of course, why of all things did she not have a relationship with her daughter? The relationship: A man returns from war. He meets a woman that used to be the girl he loved. The woman wants to seduce him. She attempts. He steps back. When this occurs in the film, we don't really understand the reasoning nor the purpose of the scene. Daisy is in town one day. Her and Benjamin go out together. Why is sex so important to Daisy? And why do we have to watch the two characters go back and forth before they land up together? When he visits her in New York, she is immature, a school girl attempting to get him jealous. Yet he is still attracted to her. There are so many other questions I have about this film and so many things that simply do not make sense. The main one that comes to mind: if you are a dancer, someone who is professionally trained, why in any circumstances would you even think of dancing on a crowded street? The scene in which Daisy was hit by a car was for too unbelievable. She is first held up by a friend with a broken shoe lace. Daisy remains behind. In such a situation, when you have to wait for someone, the last thing you want to do is fool around after waiting. The scene felt convoluted and dumb - not tragic. The montage in which Daisy and Benjamin find themselves together plays out like all other young lover clichés - they travel together, they make love, they buy a love, they make love in their home, they paint their home (there is a brief, albeit clichéd 'lovers painting the wall' scene ... yawn...seen it...). I didn't find this film to be magical, just a mosaic of previous formulas and scenarios. Benjamin 'youthens', he leaves her. He comes back later. Throughout the entire film, the audience really doesn't know or understand or get a sense of what it means to grow 'young' nor what kind of effect it might have on others. I felt very tired after watching this picture. The first half was not bad. My interest was kept, I enjoyed the characters but when I started feeling lost and cheated, that I would never get any closer to the lives, feelings and deeper philosophies, and what with some of the frustrating scenes between Daisy and Benjamin, I began to grow impatient. 2"
The Lucky Ones             ,moviewaffle,,adventure,2009,8,"I'd never heard of Neil Burger's ""The Lucky Ones"" until a friend recommended it to me after catching it on a flight to Australia. Released in theatres stateside last year, it was pulled after making a paltry $267,000 in its opening week. This is a hell of a shame as what we have here is the first great movie about the Iraq war. Three soldiers return to the states on leave and through circumstances end up on a road trip to Vegas. Michael Pena is a cocky Sargeant with a wound in his manhood, struggling to come to terms with how his Fiancé will react to his impotence. Tim Robbins is a veteran trying to find the money to send his kid to college and thus stop him enlisting. But the standout performance, and quite possibly the standout performance of the past year full stop, comes from Rachel McAdams as a naive private returning her dead boyfriends guitar to his family. Her turn here is far superior to anything Oscar nominated this year and probably the best from an American actress since Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The films strongest point is its lack of a ""message"". Pro war or Anti war, you'll find your own point of view here and Burger is subtle enough to allow you the privilege. I won't give it away but this has a great ambiguous seventies style ending, just the way I like 'em. It's always a good sign when a movie ends and you wish you could get to see more of the characters, and it's an all too rare occurrence in modern cinema. For this Burger and his cast should be applauded."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,jdesando,0,crime,2010,NA,"Terribly Happy is a terribly good Danish Oscar submission, remade by the original director, Henrik Ruben Genz, honoring the noir tradition with an off-center hero cop, a small town full of figurative dirt easily hidden by its voracious bog, a blonde femme fatale in the Hitchcock tradition, and a low-key cinematography that captures the desolate, anarchic lowland of South Jute.Jakob Cedergren, in a Guy Pearce Memento turn as a cop reassigned from Copenhagen to Australia, immediately gets caught in the web of lawlessness of a small town that could substitute for any remote stop on an American cinematic Western stage route.As in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, no good is bound to come of it for citizen or criminal; you can feel the evil in every frame of this thriller whose only flaw is the illogic of its outcome"
35 Shots of Rum             ,jotix100,0,drama,2012,NA,"Lionel, a Parisian suburban train conductor, lives in a comfortable place with Josephine, his daughter, a university student of social studies. Their lives are examined in this introspective character study by Claire Denis, a director closely associated with the African continent. In this story, she watches a group of railway people, all of them African immigrants from the former French colonies.The focus of the film is the loving relationship between father and daughter and friends. Lionel was married to a German woman, now dead. He has reared Josephine, doing a splendid job. Even though they might not have a lot to say to one another, their love is evident. Noe, a neighbor, clearly likes Josephine. Lionel, who has been a widower for a long time, is interested in Gabrielle, a taxi driver. Nothing much happens in the story, and yet, it has its spell on viewers. One follows these immigrants who have made a life in a foreign land, living productive, if somewhat quiet lives. The atmosphere is positive as Ms. Denis decided to present them in a light which makes the audience care for them. The screenplay, written by Jan-Pol Fargeau and the director, shows their appreciation, and respect for the people being examined in the film.The cast is excellent led by Alex Descas, who plays Lionel with a quiet dignity. Lovely Mati Diop makes justice of her Josephine. Gregoire Colin plays the enigmatic Noe, and Nicole Dogue does an interesting take on Gabrielle. The production was photographed by the distinguished cinematographer Agnes Godard who bathes the film in dark tones since much of the action takes place at night. Tindersticks provide the melodious musical scor"
Iron Man             ,McGrit,0,action,2008,NA,"This first big popcorn movie of the year is also the best summer movie since Spider-Man 2.What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking arms merchant goes to Afghanistan to show the military Stark Industries' cool new toy. Events unfold and he sees, first hand, what his ordnance and his creations do to real people.The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey brings not only his real life baggage and winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Jeff Bridges certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey and is the perfect foil and perfect villain because this is no mustache twirling, one dimensional character. Terrence Howard is perfect as the military man and old college buddy. Gwyneth Paltrow's character adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the wise yet sexy assistant whose a match for her womanizing boss. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is even one one the highlights of the entire movie itself. Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans away from dark but touches on it just enough. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely real dialogue than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more. That's true character establishment and development in a comic book film, people. Even the flirtation between Stark and his assistant has the undertow of lonely romantic longing and implications. What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that every death carries real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah, did I mention that Iron Man kicks butt and is loads of fun too? That you could tell from the flood of action clips seen leading up to the movie. The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man is a complete movie.(PS- It also includes the funniest Stan Lee cameo he's ever done)"
The House Bunny             ,King_of_Five,1,comedy,2008,1,"Seriously, how many more of these shitty movies are going to be made? If its not some quartered and drawn remake, it's some shitfest starring Wannabes and Never-Was-Its.The Legally Blonde movies were idiotic (pun not intended). The fact that they promote and moralize the ""stupid blonde"" facet is disgusting. In reality, the only thing these types of people receive is pity (whether they notice it or not). It doesn't help that they hired the chick from the Scary Movie series (seriously, Anna Faris as a Playboy bunny?).Save yourself the trauma and just watch this pirated on the internet. There's no reason to waste your hard-earned cash (or your parents') for a typical, trite piece of cinematic trash."
Fireflies in the Garden             ,hduck1,0,drama,2013,2,"I agree with others who did not like the film. It was like watching a jigsaw puzzle being put together without a picture of the whole scene. It's not that the acting was bad in my opinion, but there was no reason to make the story so difficult to follow. It wasn't until I had finished watching the show that I looked at commentaries, and at IMDb to find out who was who, and who was related to whom, and by what connection.OK, we all have a past and many of us have complaints about our parents, but most of us do not air them, because we are far from perfect ourselves. We also learn as we grow older (hopefully), and our misbehavior toward our children was not with the intention of hurting them -- mostly it was because of personal anxieties about life, and how to protect our children from many destructive mistakes.By contrast to this movie about family dysfunction, and the processes of remembering the past, another screenplay which uses some of the same techniques, and which is possibly my favorite teleplay of all time is the original version of Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective. Never have I seen a screenplay so perfectly written and directed and cast and acted as this one. It is a marvel, and it contains a lot of ironic humor too.The Robert Frost poem of the same name is a very good analogy. There are some few who are true stars, and there ore others who would like to be stars but are like the fireflies. Their little lights may appear momentarily to light the night sky, but they do not last lon"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,tam_burks,1,drama,2008,8,"Personally I felt the performances were outstanding. Alicia Keyes was wonderful,Queen was the pillar of strength, Hudson proved that her Oscar wasn't a fluke,but most importantly you are able to watch a cute and charming little girl actress give a phenomenal mature performance worthy of Oscar consideration. Dakota Fanning is a delight to watch.I wanted the story to end in a more positive manner.I believe that the end of the movie should have been when all the women are united on the steps with Lily,after her father leaves her behind.It is a very unique story and I believe many will be moved by these incredible talented women,whether black or white. It does have a few slow moments,but the film is intriguing in a way that made you desire to see more.Absolutely some of the most beautiful cinematic shots. Overall a great drama!"
Wanted             ,DelBongo,1,action,2008,3,"Hollywood's apparent fascination with Russian 'Nightwatch' helmer Timur Bekmambetov should (good box office notwithstanding) be efficiently assassinated by this stupid, boring, derivative, inept and mean-spirited mess.James McAvoy plays Neo (sorry, Wesley) a shmucky everyman who, whilst shopping for his anxiety meds at a local pharmacy, bumps into Angelina Jolie a.k.a Trinity (or Fox, if you prefer) who joins him for a pointless special effects sequence en route to an introduction with Morpheus, played by Morgan Freeman, and who, for argument's sake, we'll refer to by the name he's given in the film: Sloane. You get the idea. This is, put simply, the pauper's Matrix. It wouldn't make for particularly interesting reading for me to recount just how many similarities there are between the two films (it'd fill several hundred pages of double-sided A4, for a start) but the overall difference in tone is mildly fascinating.It wasn't hard to empathize with Neo in the earlier film; the Wachowski brothers clearly relished and nurtured the sense of wonder and excitement of his journey, making the film's stratospherical success easy to understand. In Wanted, after taking a plot-unbalancing length of time to establish McAvoy as an ordinary joe who is, ""...a loser. Just like you..."" (a sentiment that the film keeps repeating) it then turns him, after his lengthy 'training' sessions (which amount to nothing more than him being repeatedly beaten, and no, I am not making this up) into an arrogant, belligerent a**hole. The film pukes its cards on the table most succinctly with its final line of dialogue. After narrating his character's transformation for us over a sequence featuring yet another bloody, slow-motion head shot, McAvoy turns to the camera and says, ""What the f**k have you done lately?"" which, I'm happy to report, resulted in a smattering of mild applause at the screening I attended; not for the dialogue, but for the truly estimable chap who screamed ""F**K OFF!!!"" at the screen as the credits began to roll. All of this wouldn't matter if the film was any good at all, but it ain't. The action sequences are murky and unimaginative. The actors are given absolutely nothing to do; Morgan Freeman, in particular, appears to be barely alive during his few brief scenes. Its derivative, its stupid, its condescending and its boring. Boy... is it boring!This is the best approximation of a turkey that you're gonna see before Thanksgiving. Chow down at your own risk. 1"
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,Waerdnotte,0,misc,2009,5,"This movie appears to have been picking up many plaudits for its part in a new wave of Italian cinema. Over here in Blighty it has been lumped in with Gomorrah and Romanzo Criminale as a movie that offers something different in terms of narrative structure and cinematography. However, unlike those two movies I found it almost impossible to follow or understand. The structure left me feeling completely lost for the first thirty minutes or so, and, as another writer commented, the use of explanatory text on screen gave too much information in too short a time, particularly when trying to grasp the translations, which often appeared in difficult areas of the screen. The story no doubt resonates for those who know and understand Italian politics, but for me I felt no empathy for any characters, or to be perfectly honest, any interest in the outcome of the film.However, the movie did look absolutely fantastic, at times feeling much like a Europop music video. The cinematography is superb. Yet, the movie just doesn't work on a narrative level for an English-speaking audience in my opinion. It relies too much on an understanding of the intertwined relationship between Italian politics and the criminal underworld, knowing who these characters are or were in the real world and their relationship to each other. It is not a story that stands on its own as a piece of narrative cinema, but it is a movie that is worth watching just for the the visual spectacle. I know that may sound a bit shallow, but I really don't think it translates well for a non-Italian audience"
The Reader             ,J_Trex,1,drama,2008,8,"Kate Winslet's portrayal of Hanna Schmitz, a former Nazi death camp guard living in Berlin in 1958 and working as a trolley car conductor, is one of the strongest roles in her impressive acting career. Somehow she was able to create a character that the audience could feel some degree of empathy with, despite her having worked in Auschwitz, selecting prisoners for extermination. To her, it was just a job, like any other. She had no education (she was illiterate). She befriends a young high school student, Michael Berg, and they carry on an unlikely love affair. Before they made love, Hanna insisted that Michael read to her, thus the title. She weeps as Michael reads Homer and laughs to Mark Twain. A complex and fascinating character, she lived her life from day to day, with her past buried safely behind her. That is, until a death camp survivor published a book which included details about Hanna's past, resulting in a public trial and the sordid details of her past are retold in court.The story is narrated by Michael Berg, as told through a series of flashbacks, beginning with when they first met in 1958. While Hanna Schmitz's character is played by Kate Winslet for the entire film, Michael Berg's character is played by 2 different actors, David Kross plays young Michael Berg and Ralph Fiennes as the adult. While Kate Winslet steals the show, the movie is putatively about Michael Berg. More's the pity, since his character is not all that appealing. As a callow youth and as an equally callow adult, he doesn't seem very engaging (as an adult, he is too busy to attend his father's funeral). This is the movie's biggest flaw. Kate Winslet is in a supporting role when she should be the main attraction.The plot is complicated, and the heavy use of flashback narrative doesn't help things. The movie begins in the present, flashes back to 1958, into the 1960s, with a flashback within a flashback to 1944 (as re-told in the court proceedings), and then into the 70s, 80s, & 90s. I would recommend this movie despite the plot simply to watch Kate Winslet's study in the banality of evil. It's one of the great and memorable performances of 2008."
Twilight             ,jury28,1,misc,2008,1,"I would give this movie no stars.. This movie is pathetic. I mean so pathetic. The acting was awful! The movie starts well, but once they introduce the Cullens its pretty much downhill. Ashley Greene looks good as Alice, Jackson Rathbone looks constipated as Jasper, a wooden plank would have been a more convincing Edward. Robert Pattinson deserves the Razzie, second thought, his acting is so horrible that a razzie is like honoring him. Vampires are supposed to be scary, when Edward scales trees he acts like a monkey, move over Kong! The baseball match looks like Super Mario Sluggers on steroids! Horrible..The scene where Edward glitters is pathetic. It looks someone dumped some glitter on him.. On the other hand Charlie Swan and Jacob were spot on.Over all the director tried too hard and lost it all.

The Burning Plain             ,dbborroughs,1,misc,2009,7,"Charlize Theron and Kim Bassinger headline a film written and directed by Guillermo Arriaga, who wrote Babel, 3 Burials of Melquides Estrada and 21 Grams, three films who's appeal has eluded me. The time tripping movie has Theron dealing with events in the past and how they effect her present. Beautifully acted by all concerned this is possibly the best ensemble cast I've seen in a long while with everyone concerned disappearing into their roles. The problem is that as compelling as the performances and the sequences are I kind of stopped caring as to what was going on about a half an hour in, don't get me wrong its not that there is anything wrong with it, there's not, its just that the film, like the films I mentioned earlier that were written by the writer/director, is needlessly obtuse. I have no problem working with a film, but I was a good way in before I started to piece who was who and what was when, yes there are clues, cars for example, but at the same time not enough. Yes its great to have an adult film, but at it seems to be trying a bit too hard. My reservations aside, the film is worth a look if you want to see some great acting this is a must see.Between 6 and 7 out of 10----- Addendum thinking about the film over the past couple of months I find its stayed with me more than other ""better films"" so I've added a star. between 7 and 8 out of "
Sex and the City             ,jpatrick1967,1,comedy,2008,1,"I will preface this comment by saying that my wife and I have been going through some rough patches in our marriage. So needless to say, we needed a night out with just each other. So we decided on dinner and a movie. The dinner was very nice. We had a great time and appeared to be headed toward a very ""exciting"" finish.With that said...guys, DO NOT TAKE YOU WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND TO THIS MOVIE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ARGUE!!! My wife was a huge fan of the series and I was only an occasional watcher. I really didn't follow it so I wasn't 100% familiar with all of the characters and recurring plot lines. So I just figured it would be a funny, romantic movie to go to and also to appease my wife...she isn't a big Indian Jones fan.20 minutes into this piece of garbage, I realized that this might have been a mistake...although you wouldn't have guessed it by my wife's reaction...she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. Even to the point of laughing...even though a lot of it seemed forced...at some of the worse jokes ever put on film. Seriously, the jokes in this film made Police Academy 6 seem like a Woody Allen movie.But the worst was yet to come. After almost 2 1/2 hours of watching four, emotionally and mostly physically UNattractive 40 somethings bitch about men and try on clothes that should not be purchased by anyone during our current state of economy, I had to face the inevitability of actually talking to my wife about this movie on our drive home.So now I had two choices: lie to her and tell her what a good movie it was...this would have made the movie drag on even further for me. Or, tell her the truth and hope that the conversation would stop there.Well, I chose the latter...and guess what...the conversation did NOT stop there.Apparently, men are not allowed to tell women that the characters in this farce are devoid of any heart, incapable of real love, and are just spoiled bratty wenches. And that any woman who watched this and thinks that their life can end up like this is in for a sad, demoralizing surprise.Needless to say, I ended up sleeping on the pull out bed that night.Men, please do yourself a favor...stay away from this piece a crap. 2"

W.             ,beckwith10,0,misc,2008,8,"Saw W in a preview last night and overall found it engaging, provocative and, frankly, a bit eerie. Of course, because Mr. Bush is still in office, watching re-enactments of critical moments in his administration, still fresh in our memory, has a quality of watching an SNL spoof; one is always aware one is watching actors, and very good ones at that, play the parts of principal figures on the Bush team, leaving a viewer continually comparing the actors' portrayals, make-up, etc, with the real life figures we know from the news. In other words, the film never completely transcends the spectacle of its simulation to feel seamlessly naturalistic. This is hardly a fault of the film necessarily, only the curious timing of its making and release here in the waning months of the Bush administration. (Had the film been made several years from now, no doubt audiences would bring a different. more relaxed, attentiveness to it.) I won't spell out my conclusions on Stone's version of Bush - that for you to discover - however, I will say it is fully appropriate we allow our private and public preconceptions of Bush the man to be challenged and examined. There is more to be said about the man than merely we like or dislike him. After all, we put him in office for eight years, and that says a great deal about us as a nation. 1"
Untraceable             ,mikeymex,1,crime,2009,8,Im sorry but the ratings people have given this film totally don't represent the true value of this film. Okay I bought this film not knowing what it was and for £3 it is one of the best DVD buys i have made. The story line is unique.... displaying the internet to be a dangerous murder weapon. And the acting is pretty good. The fact the film does not feature an a-list celeb maybe puts the film down a bit in some peoples eyes. I think everyone would be buzzing if the bad guy was someone along the lines of Kevin spacey/John Malkovich. But thats been done before!

Ghost Town             ,evanston_dad,0,misc,2008,8,"A strong formula comedy that gets an extra jolt of originality from an improvisatory performance by Ricky Gervais.Gervais plays a Manhattan dentist with an over-sensitive gag reflex who hates people. When he accidentally dies for seven minutes during a routine medical procedure, he finds upon waking that he can see and converse with dead people, who want his help in finishing up unresolved business. One of these, a smarmy, cheating husband (played by Greg Kinnear) wants him to help prevent his widow (Tea Leoni) from marrying a guy he doesn't like. Guess what...Gervais falls in love with her himself.There's a lot of standard obligatory plot in ""Ghost Town"" that's specific to the genre: we have to sit through the requisite scenes of Gervais thinking he's going crazy because he can see dead people; he and Leoni have a falling out when she thinks he's tricking her just to get close to her, etc. But the acting is so good, especially from Gervais and Leoni, who absolutely lights up the screen whenever she's on it, that it's easy to forget we've seen much of this before.One of my favorite parts of the film was the brief but hilarious performance of Kristen Wiig, who plays Gervais's doctor. You may remember her as Kathryn Heigle's passive-aggressive colleague in ""Knocked Up,"" and though she always does the same schtick, she makes me laugh every time.Grade: A-"

Going straight to 3D instead of producing a conversion of a 2D film, Ben Stassen and company have created a revolutionary new film that's guaranteed to turn the current lukewarm appreciation of 3D cinema into awestruck wonder. The greatest adventure story of our time (sending a man to the moon) provides a wonderful backdrop to a fairly well written and beautifully executed animation. The characters, scenery and action are excellent. But most memorable will be the total immersion this film provides, as much of the story hovers only inches away.

Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,ethical_trader,0,misc,2011,9,"Having spent some time living in Italy back in the nineties,I was baffled how a man like Berlusconi could be considered as a leader. I (and most Italians) knew he was a crook, that he almost certainly had Mafia connections, and that he was a power mad, sex crazed 'little man'. He owned the three major TV channels(Rai 1, 2, 3) that constantly ran propaganda ad's saying what a nice man he was, accompanied by posters in the countries largest super market chain, which he just happened to own (Citta Marketta). Yet being an outsider I had little concept of Italy's political forum - I was truly baffled. Well, after five minutes of being introduced to Andreotti in this film, I had it all worked out, Burlosconi was the lesser of two evils, yet preferable as he wasn't quite as evil as those he was replacing. If ever I need to show a film of a true psychopath it wouldn't be any Hannibal movie, (he did recognise right from wrong, and only punished the 'guilty'). Andreotti is the personification of a psychopath - chilling in his lack of emotion - to the point where even his compadres fear him so kiss hiss backside in the pursuit of a valid 'friendship' - all skilfully portrayed in this biog. Yet the most telling thing about this story is that he got away with it, despite a wealth of evidence implicating him in corruption, murder, assassination etc, one court after another is overturned in its findings and the man lives his life with only short term punishment at best, THIS IS ITALY, WATCH AND LEARN, thank"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,ken_eisner,0,adventure,2008,9,"A perfect crescendo. During an admittedly slow first half of the film, the audience is drawn in to the actors and the cajun background, its lush greenery and its languid place in Americana.The actors hold up brilliantly at this pace -- William Hurt is a standout and a more-than-worthwhile Oscar candidate as the sullen, ""ghost""-like ex-con and Eddie Redmayne jumps to the fore as a bizarre, overgrown child. The scenery and the pull of post-Katrina New Orleans is powerful, forcing personal choices and sticking in the back of our minds.Then, when the action turns, and the plot suddenly speeds forward for the latter half of the movie, the viewer has already been drawn so deep inside these rich, pained characters and the twisted swampland that its emotional force, punctuated by minute changes in Hurt's eyes, knowingly elicits empathy and sympathy.The force of the movie is the slowness, the languid pace that draws the viewer in, and the acting, as good an ensemble as anything that I've viewed this year. It is slow, but slow can be good, good as a cajun conversation."
I Sell the Dead             ,talkymeat,,misc,2009,10,"I sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and fellow grave robber Willie Grimes has just been executed and Blake is going to follow suit the next morning. While he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named Father Duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber. He then proceeds to give Father Duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exploits.The plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by chronology. This prevents the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it much. Though flawed, I thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining. Most of the various stories are good, specifically the alien, the Murphy's and the vampire, but others weren't so great.The acting isn't amazing but I didn't find it bad at any point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well into the comedic parts of the film.The characters were not extremely in-depth, but they were all interesting. I also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a over-the-top almost comic book manner. The part with the back story of the Murphy's and their gang is priceless.So overall, I Sell the Dead very successfully combines horror, comedy and sci-fi into a mish mash of fun and excitement. It is one of the more interesting and original movies I have seen in a while, and it's unfortunate that independent films like this don't get more recognition."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,andrewhamil,0,drama,2009,4,"13 Oscar nominations, including best picture and actor, one would think WOW what a great film! WRONG. The con with this film is that it looks very impressive but has no real depth, soul, and is very uninteresting. The story is loosely based on a very old and short comic-book like story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The screen play, adapted by Eric Roth, gives it the old Forest Gump feel and starts out reasonably well. However, the character of Benjamin Button, a man who has a rare condition of ageing backwards but his mind ages forwards, is boring, unlikable and downright annoying! There are scenes in which Benjamin just mopes about feeling sorry for himself, bemused and confused! Yea, well wouldn't you be? I mite, but this man has a roof over his head, a family that have cared for him and raised him, albeit he was ditched by his real father and left on their doorstep, but he had a pretty solid homestead considering he was born in the 1920's. He grows up gets a job on fishing boat, and travels the world to rekindle the flame of his childhood sweetheart.When Benjamin meets his love to be, he is in his 80's and she 8 years old.They play games, stay up late at night and get along fine. I will just draw your attention to the word PEADOPHILLIA! This is WRONG people. If I had an 8 year old daughter I would certainly not let her hang out with an 80 year old man regardless of his condition! Would you? Anyway, when Benjamin grows ""younger"", he finally gets a chance to get it on with his darling, but she falls pregnant and he runs away because he thinks he is incapable of such a responsibility. Thats the message this film sends out. Do we really give a damn? Brad Pitt must be laughing all the way to the podium, as his performance entails standing still and having makeup applied with the aid of a little CGI here and there. He narrates the story, just like Forest did, but with a crap deep south Louisiana accent and just rambles on and on! The film last nearly three hours and it felt I was ageing forward faster than the speed of light. I cant get those precious 3 hours back now which is a shame! The amount of Oscars this film has been nominated for is truly astonishing. Based upon the trend of the academy awards films like this should not be considered for best picture as they are coming from a fantasy angel! But because there is a Forest Gump premise, people have bought into it and aloud it to sweep up. Go and watch it by all means, but mark my words you will NEVER EVER want to watch it again Let me leave you with this notion. The Dark Knight was totally shunned by the academy for being a comic book story. Which is more conceivable to you? A man dresses up as bat to become a masked vigilante, or a man who defies the laws of science and ages backwards? I rest my case!"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,LLOwens,0,adventure,2010,10,"A tale of two love stories--one which needs to be rekindled--while the other is sorely in need of some love potion to ignite the sparks. This is also a story about three drifters who are alienated from their own social circles. They say you can learn a lot about someone from the first impressions that they make. This was especially evident for the trio of lead characters. For Brett, his first scene showed him being released from Angola State Prison, with sad droopy eyes and lonely, where none of his family or friends are there to greet him, unlike the other prisoners who have loved ones running into their arms upon their release from prison. For Gordy, in his first scene, he would get no respect from any of the patrons of the convenience store which he was hanging out at. And finally, for 15-year-old Martine, we see her being dumped by her boyfriend, a relationship which could be better described as a one-night stand, as he explained to her that his drunkenness obscured his better judgment.So thus begins their journey to the Big Easy in Gordy's decades old blue Ford LTD convertible. While this turned out to be a road movie, thankfully it was much more than that. While the landscape depicted by cinematographer, Chris Menges was impressive and atmospheric, this roadie was without question, character driven. While William Hurt is usually over-the-top in most of his previous roles, he was as low-key as you can get in this indie. To put it succinctly, Hurt gloriously portrayed hurt in The Yellow Handkerchief. His soft spoken nature spoke more loudly than most of his previous high-strung roles.Those who have followed the work of Kristen Stewart's non-Twilight roles, will perhaps agree that she is a brutally honest actress with angst oozing out of her pores, as well as having intensity to spare. Kristen has also proved that she belongs on screen with middle-aged Hollywood heavyweights such as Robert De Niro, James Gandlofini, and in this case, William Hurt. Kristen's definitely a cutie and her Southern drawl made her that much more adorable. Yes, Eddie Redmayne displayed virtually every annoying trait imaginable, yet that is exactly what the script dictated. And of course, Maria Bello was her usual beautiful and sensuous self.What I found especially intriguing about this film is that I wasn't really sure if Brett was running away from something, running towards something, running in circles, or simply running in place like he was doing for the past 6 years for obvious reasons. It wasn't until Brett's flashbacks revealed the details concerning his manslaughter charges--proving that this was just an accident involving a good Samaritan who interceded while Brett and May argued outside a bar. It turned out, in the heat of passion, Brett shoved this man as he tried to get between he and his wife. As this man falls backward, he falls and hits his head on a fire hydrant causing him to die on the spot. While Martine and Gordy joked about Brett being an axe murderer, they were both certain he was innocent. In fact, even after Brett revealed this incident, they continued to look up to Brett as a father figure. Although Brett was the one who demanded the divorce, we would also learn of his undying love for May as the journey reached full-circle in the movie as well as in my mind. Tears began to well up in my eyes as Brett revealed to Martine and Gordy exactly what he wrote on the postcard which he sent to May. He spilled out his guts by writing that if May wants him back she would put up the yellow sail on her sailboat, reminiscent of the song, ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Old Oak Tree."" While at first he was hesitant to go to May's house, Martine convinces him to go, telling him it's not about being selfish but rather about being weak. Gordy interjected that it would be a waste of gasoline if they went all this way only to turn back now, especially if you were to consider he was driving a gas guzzler, coupled with the rising petroleum prices during post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. When the trio finally gets to the location of Brett's former place of residence, they discover a new occupant now resides there. I could feel Brett's heart break as they drove off. But then, like a bolt out of the blue, Martine spots one-hundred or so small yellow flags and handkerchiefs hanging on some clotheslines which were draped over a sailboat. Martine then tells Gordy to back up and drive towards that sailboat. Sure enough that's May's sailboat as she walks towards Brett. They are happy to see each other and embrace. Martine and Gordy are touched by this incident and cuddle up as well. Despite Gordy's lack of confidence and uneasiness around people--especially beautiful young women who like to do ballerina pirouettes--Martine is drawn to his compassion towards animals. In one scene, while driving his car, Gordy hits a deer and after doing so jumps out of the car to offer assistance. In another scene he describes to Martine a story where he freed a $10 million purebred racehorse from a stable. Yes, Gordy is scrawny, naive and messed up. Yet the more Martine gets to know Gordy, the more deeply she falls in love with him. I can't say enough about this heartfelt story of love, loss and second chances. The fleshed out performances by the lead actors brought this story to life."
I Sell the Dead             ,thisseatofmars,,misc,2018,5,"I Sell the Dead plays up its humour much too much. The sole, recurring, dragged out joke is how we, the audience, are meant to be impressed or put off by the grim work of grave robbing. But it's tedious. It's like listening to someone talk about how hard their job is: constantly. A lot of the actors are good but their characters are one-dimensional grave robbing toughies.The music exacerbates the humour. Goofy is too strong a word for it, but there is a hokey kind of (clarinet?) music that plays throughout the entire show that tries to communicate its humour. Yeah, okay; ""Sell"" is a black comedy; I get it, you make dark jokes and stuff. Your fascination with death is not profound.The movie is also overpacked, giving it a listless feel. ""I Sell the Dead"" doesn't have a traditional three-act structure, but works more as an anthology. But there is too much content. All of the little anecdotes throughout the film take away from the focus of the overall plot. Anecdotes like these work much better in print. And to reiterate, the humour is not appreciated. There's one ""humorous"" anecdote of a boy who keeps having his pets killed by his father, until the boy beats his father to the punch and kills his pets before the father can. That reads pretty twisted, but the movie spoils it with cheese: when the boy finally kills the pet, he has red paint on his face (he kills it by biting it, teehee) and breaks immersion by looking at us and smiling. It's over the top but not in a fun way. I don't know. If I was much, much younger (ten years old?) maybe I would've thought it was cool.Speaking of immersion-breaking, the movie's obviously low budget makes everything look cheap. There's a brown wash to every scene and a lot of sets feel empty or underdeveloped. I don't want to knock the film for not having the lavish budget of a mega-Hollywood movie, but the cheapness plus the poor humour and lack of focus makes ""I Sell"" a tedious bore.That said, I know this is the debut work of the director, and I have to admit this is an ambitious project. I'd like to see more of his work in the futur"
The Reader             ,Arth_Joshi,1,drama,2018,NA,"The ReaderThe innocence and the selfless act behind it is the key and the makers were aware of it and narrows it down to it and brings out the best from the book gaining passion, attention and love from the viewers. Stephen Daldry despite of possessing such a beautiful script fails to project it on screen convincingly which makes the audience switch seats on picking a side, for the writing and adaptation is equally powerful on the other side. As these features require, the performance is not compromised on any level by Kate Winslet; she is brilliant, and also Ralph Fiennes from the supporting cast. The Reader has a powerful yet beautiful concept as we all are aware, but also the adaptation and the editing which provides enough space and range to the characters and the actors to flaunt themselves but what's indigestible is the execution and it doesn't pay well in the en"
The Ruins             ,kevin_crighton,,adventure,2008,8,"Four American tourists agree to a trip into a South American jungle with a German tourist, to look at an ancient Aztec temple. Once they get there, they find themselves trapped on the temple by some locals. However, they begin to realize however, that they are keeping them there for a horrifying reason....On the surface, this is yet another movie about American tourists getting into trouble in another country. However, unlike for example Paradise Lost, the Hostel movies, Wolf Creek, and such, the threat here is not from a human source, but something else. It's a refreshing change, but that is only one of the plus points in this good horror movie. There are many more.The script, written by Scott B. Smith based on his own novel, is pretty good. The characters are well written, and the plot as it unfolds takes it's time to play out, which again is refreshing. Most American horror movies seem to want to rush through the opening scenes, to get to the so-called scare moments, but Smith takes time with his plot, as he did with his other script, the brilliant A Simple Plan. This movie isn't as good as that but it is still good. One of the key things is he never explains how or why the temple is doing what it is doing, yet you never really question it. He allows some intelligence in not only the characters but also in the audience watching. Again, a refreshing change.The performances from the cast are good. The script allows time for the cast to make their characters believable (for a horror movie)and as the horror and terror mounts, they react in different ways.The direction by Carter Smith is good. He creates a sense of dread as the the events play out. While the movie is not particularly scary, he creates a sense a good sense of dread, right up to the end, and also doesn't try and cop-out at the end, or allow for some awful twist. Again a welcome change.The movie does have some scenes that are bloody, or graphic and gory, it's not over the top. There is a reason for the violence in the movie, and also the blood and gore. It's not simply there to gross-out the audience (though the scene with the makeshift amputation will have that effect, no doubt!!).At a time when most of the American horror movies are either remakes or sequels, it's nice to see a horror movie that while not original at least is different. And for that reason alone, it's worth watching. "
Iron Man             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,action,2008,8,"Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008! 8/10"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,dbborroughs,1,drama,2009,8,In 1964 a 14 year old girl runs away from home to find out about the mother she barely remembers and who died when she was 4. She ends up at the home of Queen Latifah and her sisters who make honey. Really good drama that is perhaps too perfectly feel good. Normally this amount of wisdom and love would get on my nerves but it didn't I really liked it. Perhaps the sweetness was made tolerable by the handful of scenes with Paul Bettany as the girls father. A gruff sad man I could relate to and found myself truly heart broken by his last line to his daughter. (Oh how I could relate to it.) Very much worth a look. 8 out of 
Untraceable             ,beregic,1,crime,2008,1,"after the first 5 minutes in one can notice that this feature was probably made to promote ""rightfully"" the government intrusion acts on your freedom by trying AGAIN to scare you in how dangerous the internet is. this is why the feature gets 1 star because the most important element in any movie , and at the end of the day, is what message it sends and what is trying to influence. every other movie elements only ENHANCE the very same message attached ( sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, and in cases like this to influence public opinion). i wonder if the way this movie is received by the general public( or was already) will make you, as an individual, a simple statistic on some senators book if the time WOULD be right to take over complete control of the internet, what and how it gets distributed.also from the production elements one can see that this has a big budget as well and very precise SUBLIMINAL messages. it is made at a fast pace to exactly confuse and scare you.there are so many computer access aspects( for consumer protection) that are IGNORED( in the movie, how conveniently) as to imply that only the government can protect the poor ""sheeps"". and there is a lot of ""sick"" activity going on, etc. sick to whom exactly?( i am not referring about the main criminal plot , but towards the sub-plots that give the general picture).also very GROSS clichés that insults my intelligence. middle age single-mom, not married or interested in men( or women at least LOL), driving a very expensive car( consuming lots of gas) and taking advantages of latest technology in how to avoid traffic to get home faster. but you see, she works for the FBI, so she DESERVES that apparently...another quiet comic cliché is that you have the killer getting ""serious"" and she is running to see it for herself holding a coffee-latee or something.PRICELESS...it almost leads to believe that maybe the law enforcements agencies ""supervising"" the net ( ILLIGALLY) are definitely having the very fetishes that can make someone be considered ""dirty"" or even ""sick"".so, again, you have the almighty good guys( personalized by a very inoffensive but likable Diane Lane, ...ya right) having difficulties( implying that they should have MORE Efficient tools in their hands) to track down a serial killer that lives in SAME ""town' as they do.WARRNING: the way FBI knocks down doors, and how much power the lead character holds is disturbing at least. you see the SON( VERY YOUNG) of the financial data perpetrator, being taken away in handcuffs, and all that with no REAL PROOF except for Diane Lane ""huntch"" that IT MIGHT be him. this is definitely AIMED at scarring people and their internet habits( the real criminals DO EXIST but that does not justify this whole approach).the whole ""good"" versus ""bad"" plot in this movie is there only to ENHANCE the subliminal message transmitted to your brain upon WATCHING this.the net neutrality issue is of utmost IMPORTANCE. do not let this movie make you doubt that by making some fantasy feature about what COULD happen.(crossing the street is more RISKY then internet use, any taken day)( interesting to note that, after such long time of Internet activity, only the FBI could think of this possibility and the millions or BILLIONS Internet users have NEVER thought of it.)again , WHO IS THE REAL ""SICK"" ONE HERE?? at least the producer and screenwriter obviously, but they needed funds that came from WHOM?"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,axlgarland,0,drama,2009,7,"Technically, like most of Davin Fincher's movies, ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" is a wonder. The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. ""Zodiac"" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one. 1"
Bolt             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,animation,2008,6,"Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.A super-dog named BOLT, whose days are filled with danger and intrigue-at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood sound stage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet-a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny. Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions-a jaded, abandoned house cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino -Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.While I wasn't into this movie, I think it's a great family film, especially for the kids, it's a guaranteed fun time for them. The characters are cute, but it's Rhino and Mittens who steal the show. I don't know about you, but I think this movie had a little bit of a rip off from Animaniacs, those pigeons in the beginning reminded me too much of the Goodfeathers and Mittens reminded me a bit of Rita, if you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about and will agree with me. Bolt is worth the look, but I'm not that impressed with it, watch it with the kids and for the fun 3-D stuff. The story is just a little unoriginal but the characters make it worth your while.6/10"
Frozen River             ,mike_caccioppoli,1,crime,2008,8,"The town where Frozen River takes place is Massena, New York, a few miles from the Canadian border in the middle of a Mohawk reservation, and in the winter it's every bit as cold and grey as the film depicts. This is one of those films that depicts a slice of life that most of us aren't privy too and it seems to know its subject inside and out.Frozen River is independent film-making at its best, both vital and timely. Writer/Director Courtney Hunt shows how otherwise law abiding people can be driven to do some shady things when there are no other options. While there may still be a great divide between Natives and non-Natives, the film depicts how economic hardship has no boundaries and in fact unites us. As Lila and Ray make those dangerous trips across the border with state troopers lurking all around them, Hunt pays considerable attention to the small details of human smuggling, and the result is a constant state of dread as if anything can go awry at any time. Leo is absolutely brilliant as Ray, and Upham (raised in Seattle) is a pure revelation as Lila. Frozen River shines a light on a dark corner of our nation, one that is an unfortunate result of a useless immigration policy and a failing economy. "
Mamma Mia!             ,sofie-17,1,comedy,2008,9,"Went to see Mamma Mia without particularly high expectations. Not being a big connoisseur (or even fan) of musicals, I didn't really know what to expect. Though I adore ABBA, I never bothered to watch the stage production of Mamma Mia. But having a cinema membership, I didn't have much to lose (no money, at least), so I went for it. And boy, am I glad that I did! I can safely say that I enjoyed every second of it. And I'm not even ashamed to admit it!Give Meryl Streep another Oscar and get it over with already. If she could get a nod for the Devil Wears Prada, she definitely deserves one for this. She really let her hair down on this one. Mrs. Streep can obviously not pass for a trained singer, but somehow, it just doesn't seem to matter. It just really worked in the movie (unlike -say- Helena Bonham Carter's singing in Sweeney Todd). When I heard Meryl's rendition of ""The winner takes it all"" in advance, it lowered my expectations considerably, but in its context, it totally made sense.Most of all though, this movie was just sheer fun. People were clapping, laughing...Rarely have I seen an audience as enthusiastic. The crowd especially responded well to Meryl and her two cronies (arguably the strongholds of the movie). Also, because I had never seen the musical before, I was amazed (and amused) at the inventive ways in which they managed to incorporate so many ABBA-songs. Equally brilliant was the way the extras (usually some Greek old women) were deployed throughout the movie...And then of course the setting (beautiful Greece) was mesmerizing...Basically, Mamma Mia is a superb musical that doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're just a little bit crazy and want to have a good laugh, if you love ABBA, want to see Meryl Streep like you've never seen her before or if you simply have a secret crush on Colin Firth and/or Pierce Brosnan (his singing was nothing short of hilarious), you will LOVE this movie. Best summer flick so far. Warmly recommended. 3"
The Ruins             ,Spikeopath,,adventure,2012,7,"The Ruins is directed by Carter Smith and adapted to screenplay by Scott B. Smith from his own novel of the same name. It stars Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Shawn Ashmore, Laura Ramsey and Joe Anderson. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Darius Khondji.Two young couples on holiday in Mexico make friends with a German tourist, Mathias (Anderson), who tells them of his missing brother who had gone off to view a Mayan ruin deep in the jungle. Their interest piqued, they agree to go on the adventure the following day. Once arriving at the remote ruin, though, they all find more than they bargained for....Hot young cast in horror film that follows a stagnated formula? Well no, actually. It has all the hallmarks of being yet another in a sad long line of horror movies that con the faithful into watching it, only to disappoint with an unadventurous plot, making a quick bit of cash before disappearing in the stale popcorn tinted wind. The Ruins has generic moments, certainly the first half hour is your standard meet and greet your young protagonists stuff, but once we get to the ruins of the title the film shifts into a different world. Our fears that this is going to be just another case of guessing what order the young holiday makers are going to be sliced and diced, are quickly vanquished, this is a tale of survival, of a youthful group dynamic under severe threat, and bonus here is that the antagonist is something very different to what normally stalks these genre movies.This really could have been a cheese fest, an unintentionally funny film, using gore and nudity to hide shortcomings in the screenplay, but it's not, writer Scott Smith has provided director and cast with material that pulses with an unexpected bleakness, a facing up to mortality at a young age, and crucially the characters do viable things given their circumstance, and that's mighty refreshing in a era of horror bulging with stupidity. It helped me personally that I knew next to nothing about the film before viewing it, and unlike some film lovers I'm not overly familiar with the young cast, though Joe Anderson is always on my plus list after his turn as Peter Hook in Control. But while it clearly didn't revolutionise horror as a genre, it at least had the gumption to veer in a different direction, going deeper in basic thematics than similar big budgeted films have.Tension is deftly mounted, what blood and body horror there is (and a couple of scenes are genuinely wince inducing and well staged) is not cheap and exploitive, while the finale doesn't cop out. True, there are some unanswered questions that leap out when the end credits roll, and anyone expecting a fast paced thrill ride are right out of luck. Yet for those who lean towards a good psychological horror then this is very much recommended. 7.5/10"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,Egg_MacGuffin,0,drama,2009,1,"I don't understand the appeal of this film. It has no plot (which is not necessarily a bad thing. Another Fincher/Pitt collaboration from 1999 comes to mind), the protagonist has no goal, and the film basically has no conflict.Massive Spoilers Below.Button is a FREAK. You would think his life would be a living hell full of torment and meaty conflict...but no. Button's life is wonderful. He rarely encounters hardship.He gets abandoned by his father, who shows up later and gives Benjamin everything he owns. He is taken in by a loving woman who cares for him every step of the way, keeping him far from anyone who would consider him to be a freak. He lives the good life growing up...or would it be down? He gets a job handed to him while sitting on a bench (a job that he loves so much that he would have done it for free, but he's getting paid!). He travels the world feeling no ill effects and not being taunted or ridiculed one single time for his disorder.Most difficult situation he encounters is being left without a life jacket when the tugboat encounters a German WWII sub, which the tugboat ends up defeating with such ease and rapidity, Benjamin doesn't even have time to do anything but crouch down for a minute and hide. The lack of a life jacket doesn't even come into play at all. A set-up with no pay-off. What was the point of that? The episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to remember whether Tilda Swinton's character showed up before or after Benjamin went to war, but it doesn't even matter. Swinton has an affair with Button, but Swinton's husband is a spy! Oh shlt? Nope. That is another set-up without a pay-off. More conflict avoided. It's an affair without any repercussions.The closest the film comes to a plot is the love story between Daisy and Benjamin, which is also the closest the film comes to displaying any sort of real conflict. Benjamin goes to New York to surprise Daisy only to find out she is with someone else. She rejects him. Benjamin goes to Paris. Daisy rejects him again. However, the rejections are only temporary, and Daisy forgives him entirely. More conflict avoided.From there on, they live a wonderful life. There is even a montage showing how wonderful their life together is. Neither one has to deal with any sort of conflict for a while. They just have sex and fun all day long. They eventually end up having a child together, and Benjamin decides to walk out on them to avoid the possibility of conflict arising from the fact that he will eventually grow young and Daisy will have to care for both of them.So despite his radical disorder (that nobody even really comments on, let alone ridicules him over), Benjamin goes through what some would consider a perfect life. He ends up with everything he wants and doesn't even have to work to get it.Hell, I wish I was born backwards so my life would be free and easy.How could a story with a concept so ripe with conflict completely avoid it? 1"
"Surfer, Dude             ",hkislauskis,0,comedy,2012,9,"After reading another user's review and felt I needed to clear things up. This user stated ""The movie starts out giving you the gut feeling that they are faking it, that they are some how cheesing it up to make fun of a horrible stereotype."" He goes on to say he will spite Matthew in his death bed so I don't take what he says to heart too much, BUT, I really believe he couldn't be further from the truth. Mr. McConaughey knows that this role didn't require acting at all; it was absolutely genuine. Matthew (in real life, not the movie) lives out of a trailer, traveling the nation! He'd rather be out enjoying the beauty of nature than be holed up in a huge luxurious mansion in Malibu (something he could obviously afford). The trailer's name is 'The Canoe', which he named after a gift he'd received from an Elder Squamish Indian in a trip of his to Vancouver, Canada. Also, a couple years back I remember hearing Matthew didn't cooperate and was arrested for being too loud while playing his Bongo drums, smoking cannabis, in the nude, with his buddies. I mean, come on! This dude epitomizes the Egalitarianistic and down-to-earth role that he plays in Surfer, Dude. The film doesn't have mind-blowing visual effects, stomach-twisting suspense, or an ingenious plot. If that is what you're looking for, don't watch it. Wait until you're in the mood for a down to earth flick. Man, this movie is a coastline journey. It makes you want to drop everything and go to the beach or go experience something new, beautiful and pure. A film doesn't have to have academy award-winning performances to do that for you. It just has to hit home on a couple levels. This movie did that for me. You can watch this more than once, re-watch with your friends, get a good laugh, and learn some simplistic yet valuable life lessons. It's got some one-liners/great quotes in it, some gorgeous females, beautiful beach scenes, hairy buds, and phenomenal music. If you like the ocean, the sun, good times, friends, and you can take the good out of a situation, then I really recommend this movie. After the third time seeing I can still say it has left me in a great mood every time. You can talk and laugh with friends while watching because you don't need to listen for any plot twists or turns. It's a good time. Oh, and I do repeat: check out the soundtrack to this movie! Great songs by Xavier Rudd and Mishka. {Coastline Journey - Mishka} {The Mother - Xavier Rudd} {Come, Let Go - Xavier Rudd}Hope this helped, Hunt"
A Christmas Tale             ,aFrenchparadox,1,comedy,2010,10,"The problem with Desplechin's films is also what makes me love them, i.e. their mental-ness. I mean it's so mental that you sometimes doubt such messed-up families can exist. Cold mother who has never really loved any of her children, except maybe the dead one (and would she have loved him if he had lived?). Absolutely neurotic daughter who made her family banish her brother but never seems to wonder if maybe she messed up her own son's education. Obnoxious banned brother who enjoys to be able to save her mother to regain power over his sister and his mother. Obnoxious but so relevant sometimes. The youngest one and the cousin are less mental, it's true. Except for the fact that, younger, they decided between them and the obnoxious brother who should have the girl who would become the youngest one's wife. And the father who just does nothing but watching his family fighting without reacting. I am really not sure we could find a family so dysfunctioning. There is obviously real worse families but they just fall apart and don't stick together. This one is actually functioning by dysfunctioning. Anyway, all this obnoxiousness is jubilation material if you enjoy irreverence and boldness. And is played by a wonderful Catherine Deneuve and a never disappointing (except in James Bond) Mathieu Amalric. Emmanuelle Devos makes a short apparition which is of her usual talent, too. Some usual Desplechin hence, quite addressed to a particular type of people, quite snob, maybe elitist, but so amusing"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,anaconda-40658,1,misc,2015,5,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (2008): Dir: Sanaa Hamri / Cast: Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively, America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, Lucy Hale: Nowhere near as fun as the original but it reunites the cast who still hold pleasant dispositions. In the first film, a pair of jeans that fit all four girls formed a connection when they went their separate ways. This time the jeans are almost unnecessary and one wonders how satisfactory the conclusion is. Alexis Bledel travels to Greece to perfect her art classes. At one point she is instructed to draw a nude portrait of a male whom she will strike up a much predicted romance. Blake Lively travels to Turkey to an archaeological site yet must accept hard facts about her mother. America Ferrera accidentally gets the lead in a play that lands her both a boyfriend as well as in hot water with the young lady for whom she was running errands for. Amber Tamblyn works at a video store and deals with a pregnancy scare. She too will also strike up potential romance. Lacy Hale plays the younger sister of the Bledel character who ends up losing the pants that become nonchalant. Directed by Sanaa Hamri with beautiful locations. While the first film regarded connection while away from each other during a summer, this sequel doesn't quite hold as strong a theme. Not the greatness of the original but it certainly travels the right path. Score: 5 / "
Pride and Glory             ,Craig_McPherson,,crime,2008,3,"If there's any value to be gleaned from Pride and Glory it's that even movies built around a pairing of top tier actors with a strong supporting cast can be miserable failures if the story isn't up to snuff.Ed Norton and Colin Farrell play two New York City cops at the center of this tepid tale of corruption and murder. Both are linked by family, with Farrell's Jimmy Egan married to Ray Tierney's (Norton) sister. When a crew of officers are found shot in a botched raid on a crack house, the force puts a full court press on finding the gunman, and hands the reigns of the investigating task force to Tierney.Director and co-screenwriter Gavin O'Connor wastes little time in establishing that the killer was part of a slimy corruption ring involving criminal gangs and cops, however he quickly lifts the veil off the mystery by revealing the identities of the officers on the take, forcing the story to simply go through the motions leading up to the inevitable and all too predictable climax.Norton and Farrell both turn in strong performances, as do Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich as Tierney's father and brother respectively, and if a movie was judged on acting alone, Pride and Glory would be in the top shelf. Unfortunately it's built upon a theme that's been mined countless times before, and fails to break any new ground in the process. The end result is a film that is destined to be one of the many unremarkable titles that line the racks at the local DVD outlet, or pad the bargain bins at department stores.As the police often say: ""move along folks, there's nothing to see here""."

Milk             ,littlemartinarocena,0,misc,2008,9,"Enormously moving film/document about the raise and fall of Harvey Milk. If you don't know who he was, you will. The most startling feature of the film is the casting of Sean Penn. A stroke of genius. I, personally, never would have though that the range of this fantastic actor was as wide as this. He took me over and convinced me. I was watching Harvey Milk himself and Penn with the extraordinary support of his director never betrays that illusion. I'm sorry ""Milk"" didn't come out a few weeks ago. For those in California having to vote for Proposition 8, it would have been easier to decide just by watching Anita Bryant ranting about the evils of homosexuality. She sounded ridiculous then, Im sure, but today she sounds ridiculously ancestral. The vision of Harvey Milk is still, unfulfilled but we're certainly getting closer. Gus Van Sant surrounds our hero by an extraordinary group of young actors, in particular Emile Hirsch, James Franco and a superlative Josh Brolin. Not to be missed. 2"
The Incredible Hulk             ,Oeuvre_Klika,0,action,2019,8,"As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hul"
The Women             ,Agatha666,1,comedy,2008,1,"I am a big fan of the original not because I believe that the antiquated story line makes sense for anyone much less women in modern society, I am a fan because of that great scene with Joan Crawford in the bathtub. I love that bathroom. I was dragged to this remake by a friend knowing that it would be disappointing. Horrid, is more like it! First of all, it looks like they lit the whole film with florescent lighting and those shots of Annette Bennings hands, she should sue! I think this was really a remake of the Valley of the Dolls and they just mislabeled the prints. Meg Ryan has lost her spunk and is completely flat on screen, Debra Messing's character is dressed like a bag lady, Eva Mendez compared to Joan Crawford (need I say more), just terrible. Terrible performances, it felt at times that the cast was trying to remember their lines. The dialogue was trite and boring. And to top it all off, instead of making some adjustments to the story to make it work for the modern woman, they left it with Meg Ryan blaming herself for her husbands infidelity and falling wonderfully in love with the cheating schmuck because after all it is not enough to have an extremely successful clothing line, a wonderful daughter and tons of money, you have to have a man! Nightmare! Rent Sex and the City instead which makes you want to jump on a plane and spend the weekend in Manhatten with the girls."
Goodbye Solo             ,maggiepennington362,0,drama,2009,9,"I admit, I was very worried when I saw the trailer for this film that Bahrani had sold out or made his first bad film. I was worried this was going to be something awful like The Legend of Bagger Vance or The Bucket List. Something cheesy, sentimental, or with an angel black man who saves a white man. Thank God none of that was true! The film is sooooooo GOOD! I loved Bahrani's first two films and wish more people had seen them. But this is his best film yet and I am glad it has a wider release! The characters are real, honest, sincere and once again Bahrani manages to avoid all the normal plot devices that ruin films. Compared to Man Push Cart and Chop Shop, Goodbye Solo has a much stronger story-line and is really tense. You always want to know what happens next, but especially the last 30minutes the audience I saw it here at SXSW were rivited. AND-- it is funny! The first half of the film is really funny and I didn't expect that at all! A lot of that is the writing and directing, but a lot is the acting. That guy playing Solo is so charming he has star written all over him. His warmth and personality make the film something really special, especially next to the old man playing William. He is just perfect in the role, as if it was written for him. The movie left me feeling a little sad, but also really strong and hopeful, which sounds weird, but it's true. Its been days since I saw the film, and I saw many others at the festival, some good ones too, but this is the one that stayed with me. It is the best film I have seen all year and I will see it again when it opens in Austin."
Flash of Genius             ,Seamus2829,0,misc,2008,9,"You just got to hand it to Greg Kinnear. He has certainly put all of himself in every role he has undertaken. From the host of E Entertainment's 'Talk Soup', onto such film roles as 'Little Miss Sunshine','Auto Focus' & this fine film. Kinnear plays a downtrodden Joe Sixpack from the suburbs, with his wife & six children. Here he is an engineering professor who has re-invented the windshield wiper (or did he just upgrade it?), only to have his idea stolen by Ford Motors. After 12 years of struggle that includes a nervous breakdown & the melt down of his marriage, he finally has his day in court. Does he emerge the victorious? I won't kiss & tell. This is a quiet,understated little film that deserved far better than it got. Alan Alda also shines as his attorney that tries to go to bat for him. This is one of those films that (hopefully)will have a second chance when it gets released on DVD. Slapped a PG-13 by the MPAA for some salty language,a moment of sensuality & some rather erratic behavior,due to a nervous breakdown."
Space Chimps             ,motorhead85021,,animation,2008,1,"We just got back from seeing this movie, and I still can't believe how bad it actually was.I think my daughter chuckled once. I simply looked on in horror. The plot was awful. The aliens looked like they were scooped up from the cutting room floor of an old Barbie movie. Even the awesome Patrick Warburton was hopeless in this movie. I don't know what he was doing here. He must've bought a new summer home. They had things in this movie, I think they were supposed to be jokes, simply awful.Sample Dialog: Boy monkey: ""Follow me."" Girl monkey: ""Roger that!"" Boy monkey: ""Who's Roger? Is it serious?""This may have been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Stay far away, you have been warned.p.s.

WALL·E             ,tedg,0,animation,2008,NA,"You can read elsewhere the ordinary stuff <U+0097> about how wonderful this is; about how it exploits cinematic characterization, and even how conservative bloggers have decided to criticize it supposedly leftist premise. (Jees)I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.But other folks <U+0097> like me and perhaps you <U+0097> can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with ""real"" cameras and places.This last movie, ""Ratatouie"" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story <U+0097> which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans <U+0097> who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't <U+0097> we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers <U+0097> yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
Wendy and Lucy             ,moonspinner55,1,drama,2010,5,"Young, wayward Indiana woman, who hopes to find work in a fishery up in Alaska, instead finds herself bereft and homeless in Oregon; her car breaks down, she has to sleep outside in the woods, and she's separated from her faithful Retriever-mix companion after landing in jail for shoplifting. Director Kelly Reichardt, working on a budget of some $200,000, also adapted the script with Jon Raymond from his story ""Night Choir"". Though obviously a talent to watch, Reichardt is nevertheless unable to get a good rhythm going here since this character portrait is so unremittingly bleak, impersonal, and slim. Michelle Williams has a spare, lovely speaking voice, a direct manner and an open face worth reading, yet the people her Wendy comes in contact with do not allow this hapless girl to open up (we learn precious little about her, which appears to be intentional). The picture has the grit and ambiance worthy of a superlative short subject, but at 80 minutes we should be getting more than dead-end conversations and a tour of the Portland dog pound. ** from **"
The Duchess             ,gina-saunders-2,1,misc,2008,4,"The costumes are wonderful, the country houses are spectacular, but the story is rather a one note affair. This is indeed a shame, as the book on which the film is based, is a rich and interesting biography.The supporting cast are very good, but there is little for them to do, as all the action is centered on Keira Knightly. She does not shine here. Having recently watched her in Atonement (where she was very good)I was disappointed by her performance in this film. I felt as if I knew what she is going to do where - a real shame, as I believe that she will be one of our most interesting actors, but not if judged on this outing.Where are the examples of Georgiana's wit, her clever mind? And why are historical characters so often played with modern sensibilities - Georgiana would have known just what the Duke expected of her, as she was his property - the law in those days, not my opinion - so to suggest otherwise is just nonsense. She really was much more fascinating than depicted in the film."
Twilight             ,lomaran-1,1,misc,2009,1,"I saw nothing good in this film, although I really did like the (first) book. The cinematography is what really struck me as terrible. I really don't know what they were trying to convey with it (an avant-garde approach?), but it didn't work for me and I found I couldn't move past it. Perhaps, then, it tainted my opinion regarding the rest of the film, but I saw nothing good in it either; be it the soundtrack (poor), the dialogue/screenplay (lame) or the acting (overly hesitant at times). Quite honestly, I saw none of the chemistry that others have commented about regarding the two main characters. Their relationship developed much too quickly and wasn't adequately explained. Most of the early book takes place in Bella's thoughts, and that wasn't translated into the film. Edward went from apparently hating Bella to loving her almost overnight.We rented it through Netflix, and I am thankful for not having spent the $$ to see it in the theater. I doubt I bother with the others which are to (inevitably) follow."
Saw V             ,golly41,0,crime,2008,1,"OK, let's get something straight. This film is truly awful. Yes, I've seen all the other instalments (although I did see Saw 2 prior to seeing Saw 1),and I would go so far as to call myself a fan. Saw 1 was the best, Saw 2 the next best, and so on. And to be honest, I can't really remember what happened in Saw 3 and 4, they kind of just blended into one film.And so to Saw 5. Believe me folks, save your money. I couldn't believe how bad it was. No plot, weak characters, poor acting, no twist at the end (couldn't believe it?) and a story that jumps around more times than a kid on a pogo stick. I couldn't figure out where the film was on the timeline at certain points - at one point I though Jigsaw had come back from the dead.The truth is, you don't really care about the characters, the games are poorly conceived and it seems that the makers just want to go for gore and guts without going any deeper, which would be the smart thing to do.I expect these films will just keep going and going, they should have quit while they were ahead but alas, money is the dictator. So 1 out of 10 I feel is fair, only because it didn't last longer than 90 minutes. If you have to watch this, wait til it comes out on DVD and go see Ricky Gervais at the cinema instead"
Ghost Town             ,Otoboke,0,misc,2008,NA,"The morbid comedy or, the comedy in which half of its characters are actually ghosts, can be a tough sale for most audiences, and amongst the biggest cynics of anything to do with cinematic spirits haunting the screen is I. The reasoning behind this hard-to-sell concept is simple; the dead, that is, the spirit likeness of a human being, in modern society are usually treated with grave seriousness. From the grim tales of the Bible to images of mourning families trying to 'celebrate' during a wake; the concepts of the afterlife and comedy quite often juxtapose to the point where bemusement brought on through absurdity is more commonplace than laughter. Therefore it was no surprise earlier this year when romantic comedy Over Her Dead Body failed to deliver much laughs or even romance at all, instead only taking the two clashing ideas and, well, clashing them together hoping it would all work out in the end (it didn't). While Ghost Town doesn't necessarily do anything remotely different from the aforementioned feature at least concerning the script's comedy department- it is in the movie's emotional core and characters present that such clashing of half-baked spiritual plotting with slapstick comedy gets softened into something a lot more digestible. The result is a story that fails to register on an engaging level based upon its basic premise alone, but eventually more than makes up for it with a sweet romance that tickles just as much as it warms the heart.Bertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais) is a sad, lonely man, and although he would argue otherwise, has nobody to blame but himself. A cynically jaded misanthrope who goes out of his way to avoid all human contact, Pincus doesn't necessarily describe himself as a people person and doesn't want others to think so either. After a routine colonoscopy goes wrong in the anaesthetic department, Bertram clinically dies for seven minutes and wakes up a changed man; or at least the same man in a changed world. Now blessed with the ability to see the dead and communicate with them, Pincus not only has to deal with the living, but the dead too. Sure enough, it's pure baloney, and it certainly starts off that way with little hints at going anywhere else. Thankfully however, it's not long until certain romantic elements creep in involving recently widowed (you can hopefully see how this occurs) Gwen which allows both Bertram and the movie as a whole to shed their silly outer layer to reveal some emotional depth. Of course, the walking dead thing continues on throughout the entire feature, but thankfully it isn't as tacked on as you might imagine. Plus, linking the ghost plot with a living, breathing core, the movie brings both elements to a close effectively that capitalises on the development that was given to each beforehand. Yes, it's possibly the weakest element of the feature, but that's not really saying much at all.By the far the greatest thing about Ghost Town however lies in its comedy, which is fronted by lead man Ricky Gervais, who teams up alongside Greg Kinnear to create a movie with both class and wit, not to mention a little bit of welcome shtick. Gervais, who goes about his role here with about the same mentality as he has so far implemented in his TV roles, delivers a wonderful performance here that embodies his character's comedic cynicism with absolute precision. If you already know the comedian then you know that much of his charm and natural comic ability comes from his timing and delivery; he doesn't necessarily try to make you laugh, and it isn't in the things he says, but how he says them, and when he does so. Through this Gervais makes sure not only to deliver his jokes with enough frequency to keep amusement levels high, but he crafts a character out of such moments too; the jokes never cheapen his persona, but only strengthen it.Backing star Kinnear plays Gervais' ghost buddy-of-sorts, and while he does a lot of background work, nevertheless creates a strong enough character himself, doing well not to take focus from the lead, and yet making sure to create something interesting to look at when the focus shifts from time to time. Téa Leoni provides as the film's love interest for Gervais, and while the two never quite click as a romantic match per se, the director knows when to cut and call it a day, establishing romance without ever ruining the moment. Leoni is always comfortable in her position and shares some humorous and touching interplay with her co-stars which further the scripts warm, humanist tones.In the end I was pleasantly surprised by the time the credits rolled. Not just from the fact that I felt genuinely fulfilled by a straight forward comedy about ghosts, but that I was often moved by what was presented to me. Of course, Ghost Town, although largely a ghost movie by façade and pure premise, is actually far from such a movie. If anything, the real core here is always focused upon using the memories of those ghosts to create tangible, living breathing characters that feel emotionally resonating and of course, are side stitchingly funny. Sure enough it's over the top, silly and at times even a little tiresome, but in the end, such ideas are justified by the payoff and development of character that is established as a result. In this way Ghost Town achieves a sense of relevancy that most movies of the subgenre fail to reach, managing to speak to us through comedy and romance that comes together to create a feature that is simply good fun to watch. With an unforgettable performance by Gervais, and enough heat between characters to justify much of the film's otherwise ridiculous elements, Ghost Town is a surprise hit; charming, delightful and full of life.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,bwymle,1,comedy,2008,9,"I know, I went for the obvious.I was lucky enough to see an early screening of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" a few days ago and I am more than happy to start spreading some buzz for this film. It was consistently funny and highly quotable with a strong cast and well developed characters. I have been continually impressed with the multi-talented young actors under Judd Apatow's wing and Jason Segel--who, I'll admit has been one of my favorites since ""Freaks and Geeks""--does not disappoint. There are many familiar faces here from other Apatow projects, but for good reason. Paul Rudd, whom I love equally in comedy and drama (true fans must view ""The Shape of Things"" but be prepared to be uncomfortable), Bill Hadar, and Jonah Hill hit just the right notes in their supporting roles. There's Russell Brand--whom I was unfamiliar with but apparently evokes strong feelings one way or the other across the pond--is hysterical and delivered some of my favorite lines. Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis are sympathetic straight women to the goofy men around them. It was particularly nice to Mila Kunis outside of the 70's Show/Family Guy worlds. And, last, but certainly not least, there's 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer playing an equally lovable and funny newlywed version of Kenneth.Though I did feel that the film ran a little long, it never once dragged. There were also a few shots that I am sure will not be available until the unrated DVD hits stores because though they are truly hilarious, they are essentially the only thing keeping the film from a PG-13 rating.Finally, I will say, that those who liked Knocked Up, Superbad, and 40 Year-Old Virgin, will certainly enjoy this movie. I, personally, would rank it above the other three and will enjoy debating my friends about that come April. 1"
Quarantine             ,astroass34,1,horror,2008,7,"Overall, it was a pretty good movie. It entertained me, and it had zombie-like people (well, it was actually a virus, like in 28 days/weeks later- but still, that concept of zombies is always awesome). The camera was pretty shaky at times, which was a bit much, and at the end, Jennifer Carpenter, as hot as she is, got pretty annoying with the screams, crying, and hyperventilating. Kind of wish she would have shut up near the end.Pretty good jumps, some decent little gore parts- so overall, not a bad movie. I would probably buy it on DVD. Obviously no movie is perfect, and everyone will have their own views, likes, and dislikes. If you look at all the other past horror movies, this one isn't too shabby. Look, a movie entertains you, then it did it's job. That's why it's called ""entertainment."" Just because some jackass on the street says it sucks, and just because it didn't get many ""stars,"" doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Plenty of ""bad movies"" have entertained the hell out of me- in turn, making them good movies- to me, at least. "
Hancock             ,ltlacey,0,action,2008,3,"When you need special F/X to make money on a movie, why bother with actors? Wait, they tried that with WALL-E and that movie pretty much failed as well. Hancock is yet another movie in, what I fear, will be a longer and longer line of disappointments. Smith is okay, not one of our greatest actors, but for the most part entertaining in most of what he does. I read that the part was first offered to Chappelle, which probably would not have made this movie any worse, or maybe better, since no one expects much out of him. Audiences do expect more from Smith and when he fails, as they all do, we seem to be more harsh, myself included. Theron, an award winner no less, well, I wonder what she was thinking when she considered this role. What we have is a down-and-out super hero who no one likes since whenever he saves someone he seems to cause more damage than if he did not. He's a depressed and lonely guy, but we only know this because another character tells us so. Otherwise, the audience figures he's just a drunk, but does not know why. In the first scene with Smith and Theron we all figure out that something is going on, and know that she probably has the same powers he does. The scene where they kiss then she slams him out of the house with a fridge made no sense. Of course we do not find out the why to all of this GO AWAY! from Mary until the end of the movie, so you have to sit around until then, or do what a lot of people do lately, and fast forward. But what really ruined this movie, other than a bad script, robotic-like performances with monotone dialogue, and over-done F/X, was the jittery camera work. Talk about needing some Dramamine before watching"
A Christmas Tale             ,sergepesic,1,comedy,2013,9,"Big, comfortable house in the provincial French town, white Christmas, family get-together. But, Vuillards are not an ordinary family. The iron willed mother is fighting cancer, but this is not a sentimental story. Bottled up emotions, seething resentments, unresolved issues. And it all explodes in three turbulent days. Cold mother, dotting father that keeps everything together, and four kids, ever present long gone Joseph(died of cancer as a child), Elizabeth( successful playwright, but deeply unhappy), Paul (the proverbial black sheep ,drinks too much to want to control himself), and the youngest Ivan, (handsome, but timid with the history of mental troubles). And there they go, with rituals, carols, Christmas movies, and rivers of booze, never really connecting. And in all of this lunacy there is an undertone of devotion and twisted loyalty. The ever so familiar story of families. The crippling inability to escape where it all started, the place that made us, the people who know us and can't be deceived. So, we come back drawn by the magnet of family bliss, only to be quickly reminded why we left in a first place. Smart, beautiful movie for patient movie lover"
Pathology             ,raimi-6,1,crime,2008,9,"Wow.I don't know what to say. I didn't really expect a lot when my girlfriend dragged me to the midnight show at the Arclight to see ""Milo's new movie"". I thought i was going to see some lame boring teen slasher. Boy, was i wrong.I didn't know what I was up for -- this is probably the darkest, meanest thriller that I've seen in a long time. It's AWESOME. It keeps you thinking.I don't want to spoil anything but this movie is a real roller-coaster ride into the dark corners of the human psyche. It's twisted and unexpected. Milo - although I'm not a big fan - gives an incredible performance. Also the guy who plays Jake Gallow. Who is he, never heard of him?? He's fantastic.A little gory and quite disgusting at times but it never feels over the top. And that's what makes it so great."
The House Bunny             ,nancy45,1,comedy,2008,6,"If you want to see a cute, feel-good movie that doesn't require a lot of thought and will leave you with a smile on your face, this is the movie to see. You'll laugh out loud at much of the humor, and you'll fall in love with Anna Faris. It's just silly fun. Anna Farris plays a ditsy blond who gets kicked out of the Playboy Mansion (Hugh Hefner is a good sport in this movie!), ends up homeless, and ends up as a house mother for a sorority of ""loser"" girls (smart girls who don't know how to attract boys). The sorority is about to lose its charter because they can't get enough pledges, and of course Faris saves the day for the sorority by teaching the girls how to be popular, and, along the way, she learns a few lessons herself. You'll enjoy knowing that her love interest is played by Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks, and that some of the people in the Playboy mansion and at the party at the mansion are played by themselves. Also, Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore and Katherine McPhee from American Idol are girls in the sorority. I thoroughly enjoyed this light movie."
WALL·E             ,Chiyonosake23,0,animation,2010,10,"Well I don't even know where to begin there is so much in this one. Well maybe if i say i am usually cinical and disdainful towards love stories (at least those type of love stories you see nowadays...), and i usually see them only suitable for girls who wanna cry a few tissue full, and i prefer a Shakespeare-like ending, where every major character dies or loses something (sanity, beloved one etc) over an usual corny happy ending, and then i add, that i still LOVED this masterpiece so much i myself cried in the end, and i was cheering for Wall-E to remember to Eve, to get repaired and to see them ""live happily ever after"". I was browsing on a video-sharing channel some day and i stumbled upon a video where a guy says the following about Wall-E: ""I am a cinical bastard, but even that little piece of rotten, black glass i call my heart was warmed by this movie"" And i don't even get started on how delicate and clever the symbolism in this animation is. Or on how sarcastic, yet true all the scenes are, which ones are featuring the humans, who became more like a senseless pigs tied to their chair in front of their computer. The whole thing feels so gentle, so classy and uplifting i cant even tell. If humanity will extincts one day and some other intelligent species will find the ruins of our culture i want them to find this movie, and remember us as gentle, warm-hearted, intelligent beings, which we weren't most of the time. And i am not exaggerating. This was really truly this good. At least for me. Sayonara"
La siciliana ribelle             ,mithil293,1,crime,2012,NA,"Rita Mancuso, 11, born in Sicily gets the afflictive experience of watching her father, respected Don Michele shot by a rival mafia family. This inflicts greater incorrigible wound in her heart thus insisting on execution of her fathers criminals out of the reputation and weight her regal family carried. 7 years later when the plan hatched by her brother to avenge their father's death goes futile resulting in the murder of brother, she offers her help to law to satisfy her personal vendetta. From here on follows the story of Rita raging a war against the mafia based on true story.Languishing in my hard disk for over a year I finally caught up with this Italian/Sicilian movie. The movie shot in picturesque Italy with distinctive roads, artistic houses and Corleone-esq feel is symbolical of the situation at the time. The movie premise is 1985-92 during which there was collective negligence by the government towards the region and hence it culminated the dominance of Don mafia.According to the true events I read later, the movie for most part stays true to the events occurred in reality. Although there isn't much startling about the movie or it's revelations, its intriguing to trace the path of a lone girl against a huge empire. What's also very interesting is the development of Rita in the movie, as she is shown a egoistical, domineering proud Sicilian at first. When she approaches the law to punish the mafia, she tells them she is offering her services and not asking for help. She is shown as this fiery character who listens to nobody as fixes on the notion that she should carry forward her great family legacy and avenge the murder. Later when the things comes to light about her family, she finds it difficult to understand her existence, she thinks the prosecutor is the only guy who understands her. This transformation of Rita is what I found most enjoyable, yet it had it's shortcomings.The one major flaw of the movie was the cast, for me the role of Rita needed extreme aggressiveness and had to be overtly bold. Here in some parts the actress Veronica D'Agostino lacked/underplayed the portrayal. Also the aforementioned actresses either never looked 17(character age) or Sicilian age suspiciously faster. The supporting cast of Gérard Jugnot,Lucia Sardo played their role according to the story. Also I liked the small scene shot outside Colosseum.A very interesting movie and a definite watch if you have two minds about i"
Summer Hours             ,evanston_dad,1,drama,2010,8,"Three adult siblings must decide what to do with their mother's house and collection of valuable art after her death in this melancholy but quite lovely film from Olivier Assayas.""Summer Hours"" really struck a chord with me, because I've just recently begun to see the results of aging in my own parents and am beginning in a real rather than abstract way to prepare myself for a time when I will not have them in my life. The film does wonders at conveying this particular family dynamic with very few moments of outright exposition; the first scene especially, a family gathering while the mother is still alive and wants to inform her children about what to do with her things when she passes, is a marvel of subtle nuances in both the writing and acting that clearly communicates the differences in the relationships between the mother and her three children. The oldest brother doesn't want to think about his mother's death in advance and wants to hold on to things after she's gone; the two younger children, living in different parts of the world, want to be rid of things as quickly and cleanly as possible. Yet the movie doesn't pass judgement on any of them, doesn't treat the oldest brother as a sentimental fool, nor the younger siblings as callously indifferent. It simply acknowledges the complexity of emotions involved in dealing with inanimate objects that represent years of a flesh-and-blood relationship.Grade:"
Frost/Nixon             ,KissEnglishPasto,0,misc,2016,9,"........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A.

""Tricky Dick is at the bottom of this"" I insisted<U+0085>""NO! He wouldn't be that STUPID!"" most of them replied.In FROST/NIXON we get an insightful look at a gifted, multi-faceted, conflicted personality in all its haunting glory. Nixon was many things. Stupid was not one of them. A Ron Howard Movie about a TV interview? I was very skeptical, to say the least. One viewing made me a believer. Ron Howard has crafted an instant Classic masterpiece. Ripe with couched metaphors and subtle tripwire dialog, the film's power flows from Ron Howard's ability to present us with the cinematic equivalent of a 100 minute TV close-up of its title characters.FROST/NIXON turns a microscope on both Nixon's strengths and a shopping list of inner demons. Simultaneously vindictive, petty, rancorous, insecure and ever ready to play the victim, more than anything else, Frank Langella's uncanny performance evokes not hatred, but great pathos. History is replete with flawed geniuses. But only during the past half century has there been a media obsessed with exposing them for the entire world to see.Michael Sheen is inspired as David Frost, undergoing a great on screen catharsis. And the re-creation of the interviews is sublime! Cleverly and convincingly Presented as two deftly talented sparring partners, FROST/NIXON is an immensely entertaining/informative slice of history that should satisfy even the most discerning cinematic gourmet.9*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,aridings,1,misc,2008,4,"I don't know if it was a different version I saw, I live on a military base, but the cinematic side of things was HORRIBLE. 75% of the scenes either had a wandering boom stick or were shot it such horrible angles that part of the actor's faces were cut off. I cannot believe for the life of me that they would have actually released this to theatres with so many errors involved.In addition this sequel was a bland second to the first movie. Ill chosen shots and verbal lines being most of the problem. Being someone with an extensive background in the industry I couldn't go more than ten minutes without noticing something else that was wrong.Not worth the money to see, even in a discount theatre.

The Bank Job             ,ruhi-yaman,0,crime,2008,6,"The most dangerous lies are those that are based on kernels of truth. This is why I cringe whenever I see the ominous words 'based on a true story' advertising a film. The Bank Job is the fictionalized story of the walkie-talkie robbery that took place in London in 1971. A small team of Cockney lads, existing on the margins of criminal milieu, successfully robbed the safety box vault of a posh branch of Lloyd's Bank and, on the face of it, got away with most of the proceeds. The film uses some of the facts (the crew was indeed spotted by a ham radio operator, only a handful of safety box owners made any claims) and lots of gossip (the rumour was that one of the safety boxes contained naughty exploits of a royal princess, another implicated a cross-dressing Lord Mountbatten) , then adds some of its own inventions: MI5, or was it MI6, staged the whole operation to recover the pictures and there was also a ledger detailing payoffs to crooked police by a porn king (David Suchet, unfairly looking like the late Ronnie Corbett). Jason Statham, as Terry the leader of the crew, does his Jason Statham act and the rest of the cast turns up to give reliable performances. The whole film works in its contrived and rushed way, but it is much less than what it should have been. The look of the film tries to emulate the 1970s heist flicks but the director (Roger Donaldson) is not sure whether he wants to make a Boulting Brothers style heist romp or a more grungy Brit gangster film. Light-hearted scenes suddenly give way to brutal torture of likable characters, farcical asides lead to serious exchanges. The look of the film, although generally true to the era, sometimes appears sloppy or rushed (underground signs, for example, look distractingly modern).It is an old-fashioned script with an old-fashioned structure. The use of real names for dead characters, with all the implications on their reputation and on their families, is a nasty element in the film, considering that it is largely based on gossip and innuendo, and it sits uncomfortably with the would-be comedy of bumbling crooks, spooks and coppers"
Shutter             ,mm-39,0,horror,2008,7,"I like this movie. The photo imaging subplot is great. One notices the grainy quality which foreshadows a oncoming storm. The lighting is always dark, which gave me a feeling of dread which adds to the script. Always signs of sexual tension with the fashion industry characters. The three elements create a perfect storm of a women scorn. All 3 males act as if they have a wild secret. When the storm hits by the vengeful spirit the story theme about what comes around does go around is revealed. I like the surprise ending when obsession never ends and a broken heart begins. Be careful what one does there is always human feelings. 7 out of 10 A good mystery. A good date night movie. My friend Dax though run of the mill, but I like the stor"
Australia             ,MattsMovieReviews,1,adventure,2008,8,"Here is a film that works on multiple levels; thrilling action adventure, detailed period piece, moving romance, stirring war movie, and it also continues the resurrection of the western.As a result, the sum of its vast parts make for a long running film (165 min), yet every minute is filled to the brim with captivating detail.What Luhrmann does well with Australia is tap into the majestic allure of the outback, and amplifies it. This is no surprise, since he is a master at approaching his material with a fantastical bent, creating truly memorable and often surreal sequences, which Australia provides plenty.Aboriginal culture and its relationship with nature, in particular, have fuelled Luhrmann's imaginative vision. The heart and soul of Australia lies within the mythology and customs of Australia's indigenous people, and their often tumultuous relationship with European settlers.This is made flesh in the form of young Nullah, a mixed race Aboriginal boy on the run from the authorities, who want to forcibly remove him from his home, and place him in a ""civilised"" environment. He is played by Brandon Walters, who is impressive in his debut performance.With Nullah playing narrator, the viewer is introduced to Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), an English aristocrat who inherits her late husband's cattle station, which is located in the Northern Australian city of Darwin. Caught in a rivalry with fellow beef exporter King Carney (Bryan Brown), Lady Ashley enlists the services of The Drover (Hugh Jackman) to herd 1500 head of cattle in order to fulfil a contract with the Australian Army.Both Kidman and Jackman <U+0096> two exceptionally gifted actors who, with the help of Australia, have overcome recent rocky patches in their careers <U+0096> provide noteworthy performances and believable on screen chemistry.Tall, pale, and thin, Kidman plays regal very well, courting an in full force stiff upper lip, that gives way to several funny moments, while trying to break out of her icy exterior. Of particular mention is her vain attempt to herd cattle; and a woeful rendition of ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" to a clearly amused Walters.Jackman, meanwhile, evokes Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, and Humphrey Bogart to fine effect as the no nonsense, hands on Drover, while also providing eye candy for female viewers.Supporting roles are superbly fulfilled by top shelf Australian talent: Bryan Brown is effective yet given a disappointing limited amount of screen time; Jack Thompson seems to be gleefully enjoying his role as an alcoholic lawyer; and a scene stealing David Wenham is all evil smirks and nasty attitude as the films key villain.Yet the most impressive character in Australia has to be its awe inspiring and vibrant landscape, which is captured magnificently by cinematographer Mandy Walker.Unfortunately, the films use of artificial visual effects does clash with the natural beauty that the outback projects.Australia is a film which clearly parades its influences on screen. References to The African Queen, Gone with the Wind, and Big Country are particularly notable.Yet it is no mere carbon copy of the films from decades past. Rather, Australia is an enchanting throwback to an era of film-making which strived to entertain its audiences with dazzling spectacle and melodrama, coupled with a historical snapshot of circa early 1940s Darwin, and all of the beauty and ugliness that comes with it. 3"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,tigerfish50,0,drama,2016,1,"'Fireflies in the Garden' reveals how much film producers despise their writers, directors, actors and audience. A movie which ran for 122 minutes in its original cut, has been chopped down to 89 minutes for its DVD release. The story is a fairly complicated family drama about past abuse, secrets and betrayals, so even the most attentive viewer will be watching with furrowed brows as the missing action frequently makes the characters' behavior incomprehensible.The film has some decent performances from an outstanding cast, but their talents are wasted since the fragmented plot produces only confusion and frustration. Few screenplays can survive losing 25% of their material, and it's pointless to write a real review when the narrative arc of this abbreviated version makes so little sense. There are numerous instance where issues are raised, but never followed up, leading to a conclusion which is an anti-climactic farce due to all the excisions and omission"
The Duchess             ,geoffgee,1,misc,2008,9,"I came away from the cinema after seeing The Duchess feeling I had had my consciousness of what life must have been like for the aristocracy of 18th century England dramatically raised (both literally and metaphorically). The story of Georgiana's marriage unfolds by subtle degrees amidst the most sumptuous of interiors and landscaped gardens - all beautifully filmed and realistically recreated. Apart from the main characters, there appear a rich selection of characters from neighbouring strata of society - aristocrats, political activists, servants and children (as babies and older) both legitimate and illegitimate - all of whom contribute to weaving the screenplay into an immensely fascinating narrative. I was already a fan of both Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes before seeing The Duchess, so I was pleased to find that their performances were well up to - and in the case of Ms Knightly even surpassing - my expectations. Even those who aren't normally 'into' period dramas (like me) should, I feel sure, find much to appreciate in this excellent film. "
Nights in Rodanthe             ,idream2,1,drama,2008,2,"This movie was terrible. The worst I've seen in a while. The acting was OK; I'm pretty sure if you read the book, it's a good story. However, but the dialogs were so lackluster, so uninteresting. They made me wonder how could the characters connect with so little communication. They were short, superficial, trivial and dry. The storyline was very predictable. Ms. Lane's acting was very good, as usual; and Gere's as unimpressive as expected. I guess he'll be around as long as his good looks sell tickets. :(For the first time in years I actually considered getting up and leaving the theater. I'd say the only memorable thing about the movie was the location. The landscape was incredible. It's a place that definitively deserves some exploring/enjoying.I felt I wasted my time/money. If you want to watch it, wait till it's on TV. Not even worth the rental money!"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,ruby_fff,0,crime,2010,NA,"Did I say comedy? You certainly wouldn't feel that it is until you walk out of the theater and just might break into a smile, realizing how funny 'Terribly Happy' it all is. That's rather brilliant of the screenplay and direction. It's 'Fine & Mellow' productions, ha, indeed. This Danish dark comedy may not be everyone's cup of tea - there are terrible things happening throughout the movie that are not pleasing by normal social standards: mysterious disappearance of persons, deaths (or murders?), battered wife, neglected child, child striker and wife beater, imposing town bully, neighbors who are in the know and do nothing to help (so it seems). It's an uncomfortable community of a small rural town to find oneself in. Well, that's where Robert got dropped off at the beginning of the story.The plot thickens as you watch our central character, Robert Hanson (played by Jakob Cedergren, convincingly deadpan), a city cop from Copenhagen 'banished for atonement' to Skarrild, a small provincial town with an ill-fated cow with two-heads legend as we, the viewers, are informed at the very onset of the film. ""The following is based on a true story"" flashed on screen in passing. We're introduced to our town flirt furtively disturbed, Mrs. Ingelise Buhl (played by Lene Maria Christensen, appealingly oversexed). The town bully and constant drunk in his cowboy hat, Jørgen Buhl (played by Kim Bodnia, menacingly ill-natured). And the cast of the key townsfolk: the doctor - Dr. Zerlang (played by Lars Brygmann, calculatingly all-knowing), the card game players including the general store owner, and the bar regulars, the lady bartender, not forgetting the lady hairdresser, and little Dorthe, Ingelise's daughter (played by Mathilde Maack in silent plight), who often pushes her pram with squeaky foreboding noise on the streets of Skarrild. Yes, all sorts of predicament and dilemma Robert very soon discovers, yet half-truth, never fully revealed by the townsfolk or party involved, let alone the doctor, who may very well be the town mayor discreet, holding all the cards (a literal pun). Secrets, more back-story continuously unraveling.Writer-director Henrik Ruben Genz, based on the novel by his childhood friend, Erling Jepsen (a best-selling Danish author), delivered a noir thriller in dark comedy form all at once. Sheer talent! The film title is unquestionably befitting. It could be: How to deal with a town bully? Or: How to get your ideal town marshal? 'Terribly Happy' - the two choice words together simply take the cake. (A climatic sequence definitely did justice to the 'happy' and the 'terrifyingly tense' moments simultaneously experienced). ""Terribly Happy"" indisputably worth your while. Hopelessly helplessly with quiet glee. After all, it's a fine and mellow Skarrild community, why wouldn't Robert want to hang around and be their perfect marshal?

I can easily say Bolt is pretty much at par with Wall-E, the 2 21th century animations that conquered my heart.Few times I laughed, few times I had watery eyes, and it's impossible not to adore the characters and be at the edge of the seat as you follow the story.

All the acting was top-notch, nothing over the top or wooden. Real testosterone, just like the law enforcers I know. You have to have the balls to be a cop these days.

Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,deenie-music1333,1,adventure,2008,5,"Alright, so tons of people are bashing this movie even though they didn't see it. I thought it would be dumb too... until my friend practically dragged me to see it with her. It sounds like this movie would be about chihuahuas in Beverly Hills and their luxurious lives and basically a 'Clueless' with doggies instead. And it is, for the first 10 minutes or so.But then, it transitions into something completely different than where I thought it was going. I liked how it eventually talked about cultural identity and not forgetting where you're from, which was a good direction for the movie. With that, it was good how the human girl and the girl chihuahua both become less ignorant as the film progresses. And, come on, it was adorable how this was basically a chick flick with little doggies instead! It was pretty hilarious in some parts (George Lopez as Papi!) especially with some interesting song choices, lol. My only quibbles were the slight sappiness with the whole Disney has-to-have-a-moral dialogue and that Drew Barrymore's voice was annoying after a while as the lead chihuahua with her whining... Still, it was pretty great and it got the whole theater laughing at several points.It's nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously once in a while :] So basically, go see this before you condemn it to a rating worse than ""Gigli""'s!"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,elorac,0,animation,2008,3,"This is not a good movie. Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. The 3D was OK, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie.The story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it. The characters are lacking, I truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar this is not.I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. Also I wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying ""Lord of the flies"" Pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and faintin"
Prom Night             ,The_Dead_See,1,horror,2008,1,"Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? Closets, that's what. Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called ""CLOSET"", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: ""what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"""
The Bank Job             ,pamelakilroy,0,crime,2008,2,"2 is a generous score for this film, as it really has no redeeming value whatsoever. There are so many things wrong with ""The Bank Job"" it's hard to know where to start. The most glaring flaw is probably with the editing, which was incredibly disjointed and abrupt. It's possible this was part of an effort to artificially create a hectic action-film style pacing, but many of the scenes were slow, boring, and unnecessary, so that really doesn't qualify as an excuse. My friend K.J. joked it seemed like someone had taken the film print and chopped at it haphazardly then marked it final cut.The editing also contributed to the other enormous flaw with this film: its confusion over its own identity. It is advertised as being based on a true story, but it is filmed like a typical Hollywood action-heist film complete with the cheesy musical score and every cliché in the book. Thus, the weight of the events never hits home with the audience, and when characters are brutally tortured and/or murdered, there is little to no emotion by either the characters or the audience. On reflection this is actually quite disturbing and irresponsible film-making, and probably the result of trying to fit all the elements of a very interesting story into the framework of a fast-paced action film. The result is that the plot is sloppy and forgettable, while the action is boring and unsatisfying.The movie is best summed up by the scene in which a shot of one of the dead characters leads to an extended close-up of the peace emblem on the bracelet of the dead character. The shot seems to bring up themes of peace and tragedy in a film that has spent literally zero time developing either of those themes. It is instead implying the message, ""You recognize this symbol and therefore know how you are expected to feel when you see it, but we don't have time to subtly and artfully elicit that emotion, so just think of other better movies and remember this is a TRUE STORY.""If you are thinking of seeing this movie because you are interested in the story, do a google search instead. If you are thinking of seeing this movie because you like action-heist movies and have already seen Inside Man, watch Inside Man again. Even the smallest fragment of dialogue you missed while crunching on a Dorrito will have infinitely more value than anything in this witless vapid excuse for a movie."
Pride and Glory             ,kkgoh07,,crime,2008,10,"This was one of the best movies I've seen in 2008. A thoroughly intense movie lasting over 2 hours, it was jammed packed with plot twists, drama and suspenseful moments, and yet somehow came out feeling totally believable. Edward Norton and Colin Farrell gave some of their best performances, just don't neglect the fantastic acting from the rest of a somewhat star-studded cast. The level of violence, profanity and some nudity may be offensive to some, but it is an R rated movie after all. Definitely not a popcorn movie meant for kids.The artistic direction, cast of characters and film technique was superb. It hearkens back to the old days when the true value of a movie was in its plot and acting, not a bunch of sci-fi Hollywood special effects.I actually watched it at the Chicago International Film Festival with the director Gavin O'Connor present for a Q&A session at the end of the show. His comments were very insightful. The film took over 9 years to come to fruition (little had to do with the shoot, which took only 60+ days). The realization that most of these ""actors"" were not professionals is even more amazing. "
One Missed Call             ,MadWatch,0,horror,2008,3,"This review may contain spoilers.This movie follows the 'standard' template of a lot of horror movies that have come out in the last few years: Main characters friends are dying/getting-killed by something creepy and supernatural. Main character teams up with another person that is also somehow involved in the events. They follow clues to the 'source' of the problem. The 'source' of the supernatural problem is related to some tragic event, usually tied to a young female character.If you have seen movies like; Fear Dot Com, The Ring, Dark Water, Phone, Pulse, The Eye, The Grudge then you have seen the formula that One Missed Call is based on.I also rated the movie low due to the following: 1) The plot is rather simple, but the movie is dragged out by long ""5 minutes walking through a desolated building with nothing happening"" scenes. 2) At least half of the 'scary moments' are traditional ""fake scares"", like when the scary music builds up and.... A CAT JUMPS OUT!! 3) Once you find out the ""reason"" behind all of the strange happenings it just opens up a crap load of new questions: If *that* is the answer, then why did *this* happen? How could *that* have happened? Why would this or that happen? The ""answer"" makes no sense overall and does not explain why the events you saw over the course of the movie happened.As for point #3, this seems to be a trend these days: movies that involve the ""spirit"" of a dead person that is wreaking havoc after-death. Why is the spook able to cause all this mayhem? Control technological devices? Appear anywhere in the world? Make living people hallucinate? Why is a corpse able to just animate itself? Is it just taken for granted these days, that ""spirits"" have all these wacky, superhero powers just because they are ""spirits""?I rated the movie 3 out of 10. It was far from great, but definitely not entirely bad either."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,TheRowdyMan,0,animation,2008,5,"The traditional scrolling prologue is replaced by a transatlantic voice that would have been at home in a 1940's serial. From here, we are thrown into episode 2.5 of the Star War saga. This is pretty generic Saturday morning cartoon fare with wooden voice acting and two dimensional characters. The dynamic between Anakin Skywalker and his new sidekick, will grate on the nerves of anyone over the age of 8 years old. The stiff animation makes everyone come across as a cross between an action figure and a Thunderbird. For a theatrically released film there is nothing cinematic about it and feels like a feature length pilot for the animated series.As a spin off from the Star Wars franchise, it's OK but purely for kids only.

Adoration             ,WriterDave,0,drama,2009,7,"A teenager (Devon Bostick) who was orphaned after the tragic deaths of his parents is prompted by his teacher (Arsinee Khanjian) to deliver a fictional monologue about his father's failed terrorist act as fact in an elaborate ""dramatic exercise"" in Armenian-Canadian auteur Atom Egoyan's latest thought-provoking piece of abstraction ""Adoration"". As the fiction spins out of control over the internet, the true motives of those involved in the lie are revealed and back-stories come collapsing in on each other in Egoyan's signature elliptical style.Egoyan, as always, gives patient viewers plenty to chew on. Like the young man's monologue that marries a true story to a false one about his parents, ""Adoration"" itself is an interesting dramatic experiment designed to provoke. It tackles many issues including the motives of terrorists, fractured familial relationships, the hollowness of alleged connections made through modern technology and the dangers of thinking those connections can replace real face-to-face human interaction. Though I always question Egoyan's motive in casting his wife Arsinee Khanjian in his films, in many ways, she gives her most understated and powerful performance here. Bostick does a decent job with a tough role, though Rachel Blanchard is curiously flat in the flashbacks as his mother. The true revelation is Scott Speedman as the troubled tow-truck driver who reluctantly steps in to raise his sister's son after she dies. His story arc proves to be the most involving, though one wishes his background had been more developed.The bizarre detour into sleazy mediocrity with ""Where the Truth Lies"" seems to have made Egoyan a little rusty as he returns to a more familiar form here for those who have been watching the arc of his career. The elliptical folding in of the converging plot lines seems clumsier in ""Adoration"" than it did in his earlier works, and the ""big reveal"" comes a few scenes too early and sucks out the emotional impact. Unlike ""Exotica"" which had the swagger of a young auteur at the top of his game, or ""The Sweet Hereafter"" which came from the sublime source material of novelist Russell Banks, ""Adoration"" represents Egoyan bruised from years of wear left to his own devices. Though compelling, he gets the best of himself and let's the ideas take over the characters. He also relies far too much on visuals of non-characters in chat rooms or of people being recorded with cameras. However, Egoyan scores when Mychael Danna lends his musical compositions. The frequent collaborator does a magnificent job creating a haunting score with a recurring violin motif that plays integral to one of the back-stories.Back in the late 1990's Atom Egoyan was in a league of his own and master of his own style. In the past ten years, however, international cinema has seen the emergence of filmmakers like Mexico's Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"") and Germany's Fa-tih Akin (whose superb ""The Edge of Heaven"" deserved a bigger audience stateside last year). They often tackle similar themes in an elliptical Egoyanesque manner. But because their films are presented on a larger scale and infused with a certain energy and immediacy, Egoyan's films, in all their isolated scholarly austerity, have been unfairly left out in the cold. ""Adoration"" may not be Egoyan's best, but it proves he still has some good ideas in him and he isn't ready to be dismissed just yet."
A Christmas Tale             ,Thomas_S,1,comedy,2017,1,"Two and a half hours of overlong, dragged-out, tedious misery and gloom from start to finish in a dysfunctional neurotic family where nearly everybody hates nearly everybody else and too many try to drown their sorrow in alcohol and tobacco.It is because of pseudo-intellectual artsy-fartsy films like this many say that life is too short for French films. There are many good French films; this is just not one of them.To add to the misery, the film has been shot in one of the most grey, boring, depressing and uninteresting parts of France, so there is no beautiful scenery to lift it up, and nothing else saves it from total gloom.Not one character is likable, and after thirty minutes, one no longer cares whatever happens to them.This is not a Christmas movie in the traditional sense. The gloom just happens to be set over the holiday period for the purpose of having the entire family together so their mutual rejection can be spelt out.If you don't like this after the first fifteen minutes, you can just as well stop it. It doesn't get any better.On the other hand, if you appreciate sad films where nothing really happens, except for each family member's psychological trauma interacting with the others', then you may well use this review to conclude that here is something for your taste"
Julia             ,paul2001sw-1,1,crime,2011,8,"Eric Zonca directed the sublime 'The Dream Life of Angels', a beautiful story of female friendship and existential despair. 'Julia', his first film for 9 years, is equally powerful, but much less charming. Tilda Swinton is great as Julia, but her character is absolutely unlikeable; the plot, meanwhile, though harrowing, in places strains credibility, especially in its portrait of Mexico as a literal hell on earth. Yet Zonca's talent is also on display, and the story commands your attention in spite of its unpleasantness. The ending is ambiguous, potentially interpretable as redemptive, but not clearly so. I'm not sure this is a great film; I am sure I want to see more from this directo"
Adoration             ,gradyharp,0,drama,2010,10,"Atom Egoyan, an Armenian born in Cairo in 1960 and living and working in Canada, is a unique voice among contemporary filmmakers. His films rarely follow a linear structure, electing instead to rely on flashbacks and flash forwards to alert the viewer to respond emotionally to the fragments of story provided - those fragments emphasizing his obsession with alienation and isolation, the by-products of a society homogenized by technology, bureaucracy, and mob rule. His films have collected a wide audience of viewers who prefer to be intellectually challenged rather than be 'entertained': 'Next of Kin', 'Speaking Parts', 'The Adjuster', 'The Sweet Hereafter', 'Felicia's Journey', 'Ararat', 'Where the Truth Lies', 'Chloe', and this little masterpiece, 'ADORATION'. Young Simon (Devon Bostick) is enthralled with the Internet and creating videos to place on the Internet. His parents died in an automobile accident years ago and he has been raised by his uncle Tom (Scott Speedman), a angry young man who has never married and whose only other family member living is his father Nick (Thomas Hauff) for whom he has little affection. Simon tends to his ill grandfather, videotapes him telling stories about his daughter, Simon's mother Rachel (Rachel Blanchard), swearing that Simon's father Sami (Noam Jenkins) intentionally caused the fatal accident, not unlike a terrorist action. At school Simon takes French from teacher Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian) who encourages Simon's penchant for drama by encouraging a story Simon has created: he postulates that Sami placed explosives in Rachel's bag while pregnant Rachel flew to Israel with the intention of exploding the airplane killing 400 people. Simon takes his developing tale to the Internet chat rooms where the story then leaks out to the parents of the teenagers chatting. The 'news' results in Sabine being fired from her job. Sabine visits Simon and Tom's house disguised by an elegant burka, and encounters the angry Tom who had already had a previous encounter with Sabine over a towed car. The intensity of the make-believe story of Sami being a terrorist creates havoc in the town, between Tom and Simon, and with Simon's relationship to his grandfather. There is a surprise twist to the true background of Simon's parents, Sabine, Tom, and the grandfather and Simon's fictional 'play' opens doors of emotional reaction from Simon's internet chatroom experience and from all of the people involved in the story. While this 'summary' of the plot is confusing to read, so is the progress of the tale Atom Egoyan has filmed. He intensifies the drama with moments of utter beauty and shared love as well as condemnations from the people who are adversely affected by Simon's concocted 'lie', a falsity perpetrated by his 'accomplice' Sabine. Keeping the action level low, accompanied by the hauntingly beautiful music for solo cello and solo violin by Mychael Danna, and enhanced by the tight cinematography of Paul Sarossy, only makes this little film that much more powerful to observe and digest. As with all of Egoyan's films, it is the afterburn that lingers in the mind of the viewer that drives the power of the work home. Grady Har"
The Dark Knight             ,johnnymacbest,0,action,2008,10,"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008. 2,327"

The Burning Plain             ,cassandra_gaia,1,misc,2009,8,"The movie reminded me of Babel, which is not that crazy since Arriaga wrote and directed Babel together with Alejandro González Iñárritu. (I only found this out after I saw The Burning Plain). Whereas I thought Babel was good but not superb, I absolutely loved The Burning Plain. just like Babel, The Burning Plain doesn't do chronology and I love the way Arriaga uses the lack of a chronological time-line to put you on a sidetrack time and time again. Of course I suspected things but I completely missed one of the biggest twists. Past and present are so mixed up that it isn't until quite far into the movie that you realise how all the characters are connected. And in this connection you'll find the big difference between the two movies. Whereas Babel shows the stories of people that are only connected by coincidence, The Burning Plain goes much further than that. When, almost in the end, you find out what really happened you cannot but acknowledge the genius of the person who wrote the story and the stylish way the movie was directed.Once the 'big twist' is revealed it was like an 'aha-Erlebnis'. From beginning until ending you are wondering about the connections between the characters. ""What does Sylvia have to do with Mariana and Santiago, or with Gina and Nick""? When eventually you find out, it is like a puzzle with the last piece falling in place. The result is a beautiful picture with a sad undertone, but not one I would have wanted to miss."
W.             ,HalGuentert,0,misc,2008,1,"I already knew ""W"" was a propaganda piece, especially coming out while George W. was still in office and untouchable, but I was curious enough to see it after hearing a misguided review from someone I respect. It proved to be the waste of over 2 hours, just as I expected from the trailer.Anyone claiming that Stone is a ""master story teller"" is insane, with this garbage having no ending. It just, mercifully, stops.The only good thing you can really say is there are a handful of decent actors in the movie who should be ashamed for participating in this farce. At least Christian Bale had enough integrity to bale out of the project.This is completely a fraud and a propaganda piece trying to whitewash George W. Bush as a simple minded, well meaning, frat boy/drugstore cowboy who suddenly found religion and stumbled into the Presidency of the United States. Supposedly, he was in charge and mislead by even more simple minded advisors. Nothing is further from the truth. George W. Bush is nothing more than a puppet, and many misleading scenes misrepresent the Bush family relationships to the CIA and Bill Clinton.If the movie had any relationship to the truth, it could not have been made while W. was in office, and it would provide the evidence that there has never been a more criminal, unconstitutional Presidential administration with more political skeletons (including NAZI financier, Prescott Bush) in the family closet, a President with more connections to the CIA/Skull & Bones/Bohemian Club organizations, or a President that lies at every opportunity. The problems with Bush as an innocent rube are unlimited, and I hope someone will produce something resembling the truth one day after he leaves office, is indicted and prosecuted.Bottom 10 worst excuse for a movie I ever hope to see."
Sex and the City             ,donnapaz,1,comedy,2008,1,"Like many of the others, I am a huge fan of the series (I own all the DVDs and have watched each episode multiple times).The translation to big screen just.doesn't.work.There was so much melodrama and fake crises! The male characters were like shadows of themselves. Big was like an avuncular sugar-daddy at the beginning and devolved into a limp-wristed dweeb by the time he thwarted Carrie.And Carrie was a shrill, melodramatic idiot who ultimately gets what she deserves. What intelligent, independent woman in her right mind would go back to the jackass who screwed you over multiple times? Why can't she just be independent? That always bothered me about the series finale.Miranda seems melodramatic and overreacts to Steve's indiscretion -- which comes out of nowhere and feels like a poorly timed plot device.Smith, who is starting to weather like Clint Eastwood, came off as way-too-casual when Samantha gave him her decision. He acted like such an airhead surfer-dude, which was never apparent in the series.Stanford and Anthony were like caricatures of themselves. Oh, we have a wedding, let's work in the flaming wedding planner! And didn't he and Stanford dislike each other? Why were they palling around like best girlfriends?I thought it was curious that Carrie's friends all showed up to help her pack her apartment, but they were nowhere to be found when the unpacking was being done. What kind of friends are those?The only redeeming acting came from Kim Catrall and Kristen Davis. They are totally comic pros and I enjoyed their schtick, even if it was silly. They at least pulled it off. As for Parker and Nixon, they acted like a couple of shrill witches when scorned. Ugh. 1"
Twilight             ,abogadosolis,1,misc,2009,1,"last night finally rented the DVD, expecting a chick flick, some action, good music and a sense of fantasy and adventure. what I got back? two hours of lame acting, poor direction, no action, stupid phrases. did I mention the lame acting? there's no development, you cannot care for the characters. I laughed out loud the first time I saw the vampire youngsters in the school. no one can go walking through life with that amount of powder in their face!!! you can tell a mile away they're blood suckers. and all that Stewart and Pattinson's characters do is look into each other eyes, sigh, talk nonsense. For the first time in years i used the fast forward button in the remote. seriously!!! It is a product made for girls up to 14 years old. There's no romanticism here, no fantasy, no sense of epic love. It's more an infatuation, a whim, opposites attract with no possibility of a future based in something else than the pale look of both of the main characters. If you're expecting something of a ""Harry Potter meets Vampires"" movie, you WILL be disappointed. wait until it's on HBO and save you money. Please do!"

College Road Trip             ,johnnymacbest,1,adventure,2008,2,"after Big Momma's House 2 and Wild Hogs were cold turkeys at the box office. My My My; WHAT has the world come to? I need an answer because quite frankly Martin Lawrence IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE!!! Why does he just except the fact that he's a has-been, or better yet, go on The Surreal Life for crying out loud. This movie is a farce. The jokes and ""acting"" are stale as a slice of bread on top of the 'fridge and there's no real chemistry (or whatever YOU may call it) between Mr. unfunny-washed-up-comedian and Raven Simone who plays his daughter in a role so clichéd that it makes Paris Hilton look like an Academy Award actress. To add more insult to injury, they even parodied The Bucket List in an attempt to make it funny yet the only thing it does is make the film fall even more harder on its a** than it deserves.I've never in my life, since up to this point in my years of seeing movies, had such deep and profound hatred for Mr. Lawrence searing throughout my mind after seeing this film. This film, or should I say The Martin Lawrence Vanity Project"" should be burned in a fire along with the imbeciles who had the gall to force this crap-fest. Don't see this movie if you value your sanity as well as your date. You will regret it. Trust me."
The Ruins             ,aharmas,,adventure,2008,5,"Somewhere there must be a director's cut of this, or an alternate version, or an extended version that must make more sense that the disjointed, chopped up, quite tame version of a book that seduces, ensnares, and repels you sometimes simultaneously. It's truly disappointing because the casting was pretty impressive, in particular Malone. There is some very impressive camera work, and a couple of moments where the audience is bound to jump, but the soul of the book is lost because the monster of the film is as scary as a plate full of cilantro.The beginning of the film is quite promising, and knowing the author adapted his own book, one keeps hoping it will retain its spirit, but when the first character is dismissed, in a very shocking manner, one wonders why the rest of the cast wasn't dispatched pretty much in the next two minutes, saving us some listless sequences.When reading the book, the scenes in the tunnel are some of the most horrifying and claustrophobic in memory, as we witness tragedy after tragedy, and some very horrifying moments. We've seen how scary scenes in these setting can be. For example, ""The Cave"" plunges you into hell, as darkness is as scary as anything can be, when well timed suggestive flashes can be. In ""The Ruins"", it looks like Christmas Trees were used to attack the girls, and let's not even go to the flowers' looks and sound special effects.I was wondering where this film was made since the humidity of the Yucatan peninsula seemed to have dissipated along with any signals of common sense. Is Hollywood capable of doing something right, even with original material? Or is it easier just to pillage what worked in the cinema before and do a half-hearted remake? On the other hand, if this works, maybe someone will make a sequel and fix everything that didn't work here. Now that sounds like some original thinking."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,hripka-2,,animation,2008,NA,"Positives: An above average kid movie, with enough adult references to keep the parents interested. Not as hyperactive a movie like other modern movies aimed at children, a plus. A decent moral message.Negatives: For those expecting a biblical message, as with other VeggieTale productions, you will be disappointed. There are analogies to biblical themes, but nothing explicit. The idea of the ""helpseeker"" floating golden ball, a major element in the movie, which is a magical device that helps and guides the main characters throughout, had a sci-fi, mystical aspect to it. The very idea of a ""helpseeker"" was against the very character of what I had come to expect from past VeggieTales productions.As a kids movie, I would give it a 7. But for those expecting a VeggieTales biblical message, look elsewhere. My disappointment over the moderation of their message reduces my rating."

And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film. 1"

It's Hollywood...and a ""loose"" adaptation...And so, once the credits rolled, and I was one of the many people laughing and clapping, the fear had long passed.The films works. It provides the amazing opiate of style and dark humor, and in such massive quantities that both evoke the spirit of the source material and utterly ignore the latter 90% of the graphic novel. But that independent streak works for Wanted. You feel a sense of amused wonder and curiosity throughout, and all the plot twists that follow are different enough from the source to actually hold your attention without ever being prematurely obvious.James McAvoy does an excellent job, and his wry, sarcastic narration sets the mood of the film perfectly. His evolution from pansy to Neo has a genuine and pleasantly arrogant feel to it, although the stereotypical Rocky-esquire training montage is used to speed things up a bit (what a tiresome tool). Basically, his version of a cinematic Neo is both smarter, more entertaining, and more intelligent.Backing him up, more with sexy looks and an ""I'm too cool for you; you're not Brad"" attitude than anything, is Angelina Jolie. Her character screams Trinity. And loudly. Regardless, watching her on-screen is a pleasure. She's terribly likable, and extremely lethal throughout.Morgan Freeman's Morpheus, called Sloan here, is played well, although the role is a bit beneath his skill as an actor. He makes it work though, playing the wizened and mature helper very well. More importantly, he delivers an excellent (and unexpected) line that rivals Samuel L. Jackson's memorable expression from Snakes on a Plane. That alone makes any price of admission worthwhile.Any other character serves as nothing more than white noise, there to populate the world rather than intrigue.The theme of Wanted is all about taking charge of your life and making your own choices, something that the very premise of the first hour of the film both adheres to and contradicts. Rather than analyze it here (and waste time arguing the pleasantly mad logic of a movie where bullets bend stylishly), I'll leave that to the people who inevitably will, assuming the bullet-fu and gore don't completely captivate them (and they should). Wanted IS violent, truly, and yet it doesn't strive to turn every frame into a gory, action-packed orgasm. The film handles it with grace and a style I sorely wish more action movies took into consideration.As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself.This really isn't a superhero comic adaptation...it's The Matrix with a great sense of humor.Enjoy it. 611"
Prom Night             ,nomad-48,1,horror,2008,1,"Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one. This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. It's dramatic <U+0085> it's sappy <U+0085> it's immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife. You'd probably go <U+0085> ""OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa."" Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING). I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.As if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of ""Silver Spoons"", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend <U+0085> at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! A complete waste of my time and yours. I bit the bullet to get you this review. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!! 1"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,rparham,1,comedy,2008,8,"Prior to the release of The 40 Year Old Virgin, it is likely that few people knew the name Judd Apatow. Now, just three years later, that name has become almost a stamp of comedy quality, with such films as Knocked Up and Superbad following on the heels of The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now, the Apatow steamroller moves forward with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and once again it has mined comedy gold, with lots of laughs, but also, as with many of the previous film's from Apatow's company, a nice streak of sweet romance to go along with the laughs.Fogetting Sarah Marshall focuses on Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), a Hollywood composer who's girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), is the star of a CSI-style police procedural series. Jason is a bit of a layabout (who also isn't afraid to walk around his apartment naked), and Sarah has decided she has had enough of him, so she is breaks up with Peter, leaving him in a seemingly unending pool of despair.To try to take his mind of Sarah, he takes an impromptu vacation to Hawaii, but quickly discovers, to his horror, that Sarah is also at the same hotel as him, with her new boyfriend, recently on the wagon British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). However, while doing his best to avoid Sarah, Peter finds himself falling for a hotel staff member, Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis).As with such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy that isn't afraid to mine the more vulgar for comedy, nor does it shy away from some rather frank nudity, including plenty of footage of star Segel (who is also the screenwriter). The upside is that, unlike many other sophomoric comedies these days, the raunchier material actually produces laughs. Much of the film's best humor comes from Brand's performance as off the wall Snow. The character has lots of great scenes and lines, capitalizing on the characters seeming insatiable libido.Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't just provide lots of laughs, it also features an involving and touching romance between Peter and Rachel. Both Segel and Kunis have a nice chemistry between them that fuels an involving romance. As the film progresses, we can't help but root for the characters to find themselves together in the end.In addition to the previously mentioned Brand, the cast of Forgetting Sarah Marshall gives us both great laughs and characters we can be involved with. Segel proves to be relatively low on insecurity as he puts himself almost completely on display (literally). His Peter is an character whose rather unassuming nature wins you over. Kristen Bell makes the films titular character at times apparently self-involved, but also someone who has a soft spot for her ex-boyfriend. Kunis' Rachel is a character that is both no-nonsense and full of sweetness.In the end, Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves to be another winner from ""Team Apatow"", and belongs right next to the previous hits from his creative team. If you are looking for both laughs and a dash of romance, look no further than Forgetting Sarah Marshall."
21             ,Lechuguilla,0,crime,2008,8,"Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact-based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.The script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. ""Variable change"" is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And ""winner winner, chicken dinner"" is the group's lingo for gambling success.Production design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source ""Bringing Down The House"" by Ben Mezrich.Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, ""21"" is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in ""21"" really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining. 2"
The Duchess             ,joestank15,1,misc,2009,8,"The Duchess - Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgiana's passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).Kiera Knightley again does a period piece and again looks mostly out of place. She's British alright, but a few stone away from looking like she belongs in 1770's Britain. It's augmented by the fact that her character, based on a real woman, was supposed to have gone through about 6 pregnancies, 4 of them successful. Knightley's emaciated form is just wrong. What is right though, is her performance. As a mother, as a chasismatic political presence and a woman desperate for a happy life she nails it absolutely.I could have seen a little less focus on the love triangle and a little more on the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of this woman becoming such an important and popular cultural icon in British society. The film glosses over how this came to be, and asks us to take it as a fact after one brief scene showing the Duchess's political shrewdness. It's another case of Hollywood ignoring what's different about a film, preferring the safety of delivering what people have seen before.Fiennes gives such a quiet performance right from the start but it grows and fills the area. It's often a mesmerizing performance because of his rigid adherence to societies expectations and rules at the cost of all else. Fiennes occupies the screen whenever he's in a scene. When he and the Duchess argue, she's like water smashing up against the unyielding cliff. Ralph Fiennes is aw-inspiringly scary in one scene without seeming in anyway over the top or demonizing of what his character represents. Ultimately his character is human and believable; purely a man of his times. His character is so down to earth and in the end simple. All he wanted from his marriage was a son and to be left alone to play with his dogs.A mesmerizing turn from Fiennes in a likable, if familiar film, The Duchess gets a B+"
Nim's Island             ,vikingoddess-1,1,adventure,2008,3,"Now granted, this wasn't a movie I wanted to see, just a movie I saw whilst spending time with my best friend and her (kindergarten aged) son. Not to say its a horrid waste of time, but if you are over the age of oh, 12 or so and don't have a youngling to tag along...don't bother. It'll be on HBO soon enough. I didn't care for Breslin's character and spent most of the movie with my palm itching (to smack Nim's bratty face off, that is). I will say that this movie raised my opinion of Jodie Foster considerably, her soup mad agoraphobic writer was excellent. Gerard Butler was marvelous, as usual, and the pair of them more or less carried the movie. (Watch your back, Harrison)"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,DICK STEEL,0,animation,2008,7,"Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are back in their animated animal roles which 3 years ago saw their zoo animals being transported to Madagascar in a typical fish out of water tale, where they had to rely on their street smarts and friendship to survive in an environment they do not fully understand. While it's the usual pop-culture jokes and witty one liners that plague recent animated films, there were some gems in that movie, the ones which stuck suck as the crowd favourite penguins stealing the whole show, as well as the madcap rave party tune Move It!Beginning directly where we last saw Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Smith), the penguins have finally built a plane that ought to bring our merry crew back to New York, together with Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his sidekick (Cedric the Entertainer), but of course should that happen, there'll be no sequel to begin with. So we have the crew crash land into the continent Africa, thereby guaranteeing yet another tale of being from the outside, but now having a habitat that's much closer to their natural environment, one which sees the animal types in question grouped together into one reserve for storytelling convenience.Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, who also provided the voice of Skipper the head penguin, the storyline might seem like a poor man's cousin to Disney's The Lion King, what with exiles and alpha-lions battling it out to be king of the habitat. The filmmakers had taken the opportunity to craft the backstory for Alex a little more, so that the main plot of his return to his home could be dwelled upon, with sub plots for the others to fall into place. You have Alex's return and reunion with his parents, with adversary coming from an earlier generation, there's Marty who discovers that he's no longer unique but the same as every other hundredth zebra out there, Glora looking for love with other hippos now that there's no lack of suitors, and Melman fighting his own cowardice to reveal his feelings for Gloria, as well as being appointed the witch doctor for the land.And if you think that the primary voice cast is already A-list, the film piles on to that list with the likes of the late Bernie Mac voicing Zuba the alpha-lion, Alec Baldwin again in a villainous role as his rival Makunga, and Will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas in a hilarious role of hippo-Casanova Moto Moto (the name's so good you have to say it twice!) The songs department falls up a bit short this time round, though thankfully ""Move It!"" wasn't conveniently and lazily played ad-nauseam. Given the army of illustrators working on the project, you can't expect quality to drop from its predecessor, though there's nothing new to be injected into a mature presentation.Despite the plundering of the same old family values / theme / storyline and the importance of establishing strong friendships, this new Madagascar managed to deliver on multiple fronts, joining the ranks of the few whose sequels are superior than the original. The comedy which got piled up here managed to work through the punchlines, leading to a number of characters like the monkeys and even the tough-cookie granny to steal some limelight from the lovable penguins. If you liked the original, then you'e likely to fall in love with this one."
Twilight             ,firefly-27,1,misc,2009,1,"I read the book and was so excited to see this movie, but was utterly disappointed. With in the first ten minutes I wanted to get up and leave. The special effects were cheesy, the running scenes were not what I would have expected to see, and seemed more cheesy than unreal.The characters never seemed to be natural they all seemed like they were being forced to say what they were saying and just awkward to watch. Edward looked constipated through out the whole film and it was just uncomfortable to watch. It did follow the book's storyline very well with some parts left out as usual, but the worst acting ever! I would not recommend seeing this movie, read the book instead."
Pathology             ,milanstanojevic,1,crime,2008,9,"...is that if you like thrillers, you NEED to see this film.So much better than almost every big budget drone that I care to remember. I will not go into pretentious details but do go ahead and watch this instead of ... umm ... say the Dark Knight, it's much better.Watch this film in the same mindset that you watched ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but prepare to be disappointed.That is all.P.S. Not for the easily offended - especially if you mind seeing the inside of a human body."
Ghost Town             ,JoeytheBrit,0,misc,2009,NA,"Ricky Gervaise is one of those comedians who should be more annoying than he actually is. That's not to say he isn't annoying - he is - but this annoyance factor is surpassed by his sense of humour and comic timing. He gives a good performance here, and is entirely believable as a cold misanthropic dentist who finds himself harassed by dead people after temporarily dying himself on the operating table. Greg Kinnear is the dead guy who manages to monopolise Gervaise's services and it is in the relationship between these two - and Kinnear's wife (Tea Leoni) - that the film finds it's heart.The story is obviously pretty daft, but it is the comedy - and Gervaise's delivery of it - that makes this film better than it might otherwise have been. While he's no leading man - as he grows older he is beginning to look more and more like a young(ish) Winston Churchill - this type of role is perfect for his talents and he doesn't waste the opportunity to show them off to good effect. There are a handful of genuinely funny moments, which is quite a rich haul for Hollywood comedies these days, and a refreshing resistance to the temptation to insert major gross-out gags. Despite a few cynical expletives and near the knuckle jokes, this one would probably appeal to fans of comedies from Hollywood's vintage er"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,sarahandbray,0,animation,2008,2,"I now know this is rated PG and not G--I honestly didn't check before we went, so that is my own fault. My kids LOVED the first Madagascar, and I saw it with them over and over on DVD. There's some silly physical humor, but nothing I was too offended by. Their favorite part of the first one was when the underpants went flying! I can honestly say that when I saw the trailers months ago, I was excited to take my kids to see it! The second one, I thought, had inappropriate language for kids, lots of sexual innuendos that were more blatantly obvious than those ""hidden"" in other cartoons, and was just super VIOLENT! Plus, I thought it was a lame makeover of The Lion King (with a second-rate ""Scar"" and ""Mufasa""). I didn't think the voice-overs were very good or convincing, and I actually thought the plot was quite boring. It was action-packed and suspenseful at times.Overall, I think they are marketing this movie to a much younger crowd than those who should be seeing it (all the Madagascar toys in the kids Happy Meals, for example!) Three children (out of only maybe a dozen in the theater) actually left SCREAMING and CRYING after the first 10 minutes of the movie.Anyway, if your kids are 9 or 10, I'm sure it's no big deal. But for any kids Kindergarten or younger, this is too scary for most and violent for no really good reason (Daddy lion getting shot, constantly beating up the old woman, etc.).Very disappointed!"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,les_yeux_brun,1,misc,2008,3,"I found the first movie to be far more superior than the second. The sisterhood is supposed to be a movie based on dialogue, but I felt as though many of the characters were constantly getting into arguments without having a coherent dialogue. They'll say a few words and all of the sudden they wont be talking anymore or be broken up, without really building up the feeling of anger. It was extremely unrealistic and the characters were mostly hollow and bland. I don't think it was so much the actors fault as it was whoever composed the movie script. I haven't read the actual books but if they are anything as bland as the movie, I don't ever want to.What I found the most disturbing by far was when Tibby had her pregnancy scare. When I went to the theater to watch this movie I saw the 80% of the audience were young teen girls around 12 to 15. So here you have Tibby scared half to death that Brian's condom broke. Hello! They have such a thing as a Day After Pill. All Libby would have had to do is go to the doctor ASAP, and she would have had a prescription for the pill and her chances of pregnancy would have been reduced significantly, without resorting to contemplating abortion. So here you have a group of very young girls who would most likely go through a chunk of their lives thinking that they have no choice in situations like this. And then you wonder why the United States has so many teen pregnancies compared to other so-called developed countrie"
The Escapist             ,marc-cheyne,,crime,2011,7,"not a bad film: good atmosphere, cast, acting & OST c/o Leonard Cohen.it bares a resemblance, and even a few lines, to Shawshank Redemption. but then a lot of prison films do now.however, the UK prison depiction was wholly inaccurate. British prisons have had in-cell lighting, kettles & tvs for over a decade. cons have never 'run' a whole prison, ever, anywhere. and the whole hazing/raping aspect - is a purely American phenomenon. and still you call us Brits fags!! also, there aren't any library cards as such, the common currency inside is drugs, tobacco & foodstuffs.also, kat is an African herb, with amphetamine like qualities - as opposed to something you could knock together in an ad-hoc laboratory with oranges & fruit cak"
The Strangers             ,louhazosc,,horror,2008,2,"I have used IMDb for years but have never registered to submit a review. However, after reading positive reviews on The Strangers and actually having it compared to ""The Shining"" and possibly being the best horror movie ever I HAD to comment.First off, one of my favorite horror movies for scary and suspense is The Ring and horror movies I love are classics such as The Shining, The Exorcist, and comedic as Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, The Saw series has also impressed me MOST of the time (3 was a dud). If you consider my choices terrible then stop reading, this review will not cater to you anyway.Movies such as the Shining were incredible based on imagery and superb acting. Nightmares were brought onto the screen and it was not necessary to jump out and scare you. The twin sisters at the end of the hall just sucked! Images from the Ring - need I say more. Again there were the jump scenes but the images still scare me when I work alone at night in the office. Oh and the suspense just seeing water leaking into the room knowing that she was coming.This DOES NOT happen at all in The Strangers. In 2008 horror has escalated to a point where it is difficult to cause a scare without the jump out and scare you. So The Strangers went the route of ""The Sick and Twisted Family"" who you see every single scene of in the previews. Guy in the burlap mask stands ominously in the kitchen without Liv seeing him....oooooo scary. The girl stands in the woods 100 yards away....oooo terrifying. The other girl is on the swing...oooo not that. They banged on the door and window a few times to really increase the tension though. Two times the girl even asked ""Is Tara home?"" is that ""I am so stoned"" voiceThat was it!!! I promise you. Oh wait, the guy in the mask jumped onto the window once when Liv was looking out. OK, you got me, I jumped. Every line that the Strangers say in the previews is their complete dialog - ""You're gonna die"" and ""Because you were home"" THAT WAS IT. Well, a couple more at the very end. You want a sick twisted family?? Rob Zombie hit the peak on that one, sorry. What's in the killer's head is far more scary than a mask...Hannibal maybe?So eventually The Strangers make their way in. Oh, disturbing images and massive bloodshed that made this rated R? Are you serious? You ready? Liv cuts her hand really really really bad, a shotgun blow to the head where the impact isn't show but the body is on the ground for a while and some head is missing, then the grand finale? Our main characters are tied up and a butcher's knife is slowly inserted by each Stranger into the victims, 2 in the guy, one in Liv - no blood...Movie over. You like it? 1"
Wanted             ,eccohawk,1,action,2008,4,"Wanted is a nonstop tour de force of preposterous scene after preposterous scene. What you get is something you would expect from a comic book movie. The only problem is, if you have't read the comic book, every far-fetched, ridiculous plot point and scene seems just that: far-fetched and ridiculous.So what about the action scenes? The preview made it look great, right? If you like beautifully crafted action scenes, then you are in for a rock and roll time... for about 25 percent of the movie, if that. Whenever an action scene pops up, it does something exciting and fun to watch and then suddenly disappears in an instant, leaving us with our narrator and central character, Wesley, droning on and on for the next 20 or so minutes.And what else do we get with him? Aside from a poor Chicago accent, we get a very boring, unsympathetic character who is able to accept his fate without any real believable scrutiny and somehow miraculously learns to become the best assassin ever in a matter of about two weeks or so. And don't get me started on how all of these amazing assassins all throughout the film drop like flies one after another, while none of them can compete with our hero, Wesley, who just picked up the job a short while ago. But I suppose I should concede something. I mean Wesley does have his amazing 400 heartrate that gives him adrenaline instead of a heart attack.But wait, there's more! We also have the wonderful privilege of his incessant whining about his pathetic life; it is a style of narration extremely reminiscent of Edward Norton's character in Flight Club. I'll paraphrase for you, ""I am a loser who buys IKEA furniture and who wades through life without meaning. You are a loser too. You and I are just alike. Keep watching me in all my loserness and I will keep pointing out to you in every other scene that you are a loser too."" Despite not actually being a loser, I found this to be quite aggravating. I didn't pay ten bucks for a movie to be told over and over again that I am doing nothing with my life. Does Hollywood, or at least the film's writers/director really believe that because someone is at a movie that they are as big of a loser as our little character Wesley here? And the last line of the film simply sealed that annoyance for me.But it wasn't all bad. If you like Angelina Jolie, she looks just as good in this as she has in previous shoot 'em up thrillers. Moreover, you even get to see her partially naked, so who can argue with that, right? And what about all of those awesome action scenes I mentioned? On the rare occasion they actually popped up, I admit they were indeed fun and entertaining, albeit unbelievable.Unfortunately, I found myself in disbelief at all of the phenomenal feats they were accomplishing throughout the feature during said action scenes. Our main character, as well as others, has the unique ability to pump out an over 400 heartrate, giving them nasty abilities like jumping tall buildings in a single bound and slowing down time and most of all the uncanny ability to curve the angle of bullets as they are fired.Now I am not one without an ability to suspend disbelief. Shooting wings off the fly? Sure. Curving a bullet as its fired so it can slightly bend around an object and hit something behind it? Sure, why not? But when it comes right down to it when you have a single bullet fired from a gun and it curves around a 360 degree angle blowing through 9 different skulls of the most prominent assassins in the world and the bullet flies in a perfect circle killing everyone with no ducking or anything? Sorry. Angelina who fired this bullet is just human. And bullets just don't do that. And in the end, or more specifically about halfway through the preposterousness that is this film, all I wanted was for one of those bullets to fire off, curve its way through the movie screen, and just end the torture."
A Christmas Tale             ,dbborroughs,1,comedy,2008,9,"After matriarch Junon is diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness her family comes together at Christmas in the hopes of putting things right.I've explained that badly, which is fine since I doubt there is any way I can truly do justice to this wonderful film about families, how they make us crazy, how they help us along and how life kind of gets in the way. I loved the way that about a half hour into the film I knew I was going to have to watch this again because I was simply enjoying it so much. Never mind that the film has a great deal going on that I simply didn't catch (Thank you IFC in Theaters on Demand for making it possible to do so with out breaking the bank). This is a magical movie its worth the effort to see.I have to say I love that Catherine Deneuve, a babe if there ever was (and is one) is married to Jean-Paul Roussillon, a small squat almost troll like man. You watch the two together and there is such love and ease and magic between them that the pairing is utterly perfect. Their pairing makes absolute sense, more than most romantic pairing that the movies have ever shown us. Its brilliant, and its just a small element of a film that gets adults and families right. To be certain its idealized in many ways but the film still feels wonderfully real.Its just a great film from top to bottom, with a great script, a great look (and sound) and a cast that is as good as it gets.See this film, it's one of the better films of the years and I can't stop talking about it"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,emeryconsultant,1,drama,2008,3,"I was disappointed in this movie, which moved so slowly I thought I was watching paint dry. Having read the book, I knew the plot already, but even someone who doesn't know what's happening will likely get to bored to care by the time something happens. Dakota Fanning as Lilly turns in another great performance, but Rosalie displayed almost no personality. Mayand August were static; every line was delivered with the same tone and facial expression. As for the theme of the strength of women, this gets lost in an emphasis on race, instead of vice versa. Two white people in the movie are worthy of the air they breathe. Every black person is cultured, fair, kind, etc. No balance at all. I recommend renting it. At least then you can fast forward."
The Merry Gentleman             ,buzzbruin,,crime,2009,9,"Michael Keatons directorial debut is incredible. A beautifully paced film about relationships lonely people and a world of difference between occupations and normal perceptions of society. A subtle bringing together of lost souls. It reminded of Eastwoods style--little dialogue, gestures and expressions sighs and looks counting for the shift of emotions. A dark haunting film magnificently photographed,with shadow darkness and light comprising a stunning view. Miss Mcdonald who I remember from an HBO film with Bill Nighy is simply superb in the role of a receptionist. with one fellow worker friend and a secret reason for her independence. If you want to see a real haunting film about the meaning of life and the world of humanity, I beg you to see this film. I see performances of Oscars and the best film I've seen this year so far."
The Ruins             ,HartOgold,,adventure,2008,9,Saw The Ruins tonight with my 16 year old daughter at a special showing and it was surprisingly good.Yes there was some gore and some laughs and definitely some jump worthy moments and a lot of suspense! I've seen other reviews here talking about the killer vines but really they don't kill any of the characters. What the vines do though is pretty freaky and the memory of them will likely give you a twinge or two the next time you have a muscle spasm!I've always loved horror moves and this was absolutely a good one and worth the view. 
Ponyo             ,dballred,1,animation,2008,10,"Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does the ""tri-fecta,"" (writes, directs, and animates a movie) he makes a classic film for the ages. He has done it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo.The story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard named Fujimoto. The fish escapes from her father and rides a jellyfish to shore, where she is caught up in a dredging operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately drawn animated scenes ever undertaken and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release. Miyazaki, who shows no fear of having a busy scene, has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of individually-drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time.When the fish escapes the dredging operation while still trapped in the bottle, a five-year old boy named Sousuke spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle, saving her. Since she is the result of her father's magic, she is capable of magic herself--and her father actively tries to retrieve her. The boy names the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, her father successfully retrieves her back into captivity.After a war of wills with her father, Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human. She meets up again with Sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support.The story itself is simple--as are Miyazaki's films in general--and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. While I haven't viewed it enough to be sure, the film doesn't seem to be one which will keep scholars in long discussions as Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi did. Nonetheless, this is the ultimate feel-good entertainment movie. I gave the movie a ten out of ten rating. 1"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,HeartOfSky,0,misc,2008,5,"The only reason I could offer a rating of 5 was for the dancing. The storyline was awful, cliché, and a pathetic example of a movie sequel. Every encounter/experience on the part of the girl were just circumstances that served to validate her point of view. Anything that offered a growth opportunity was either not included in the script or edited out. Where the first film was a yet another film hybridizing formal and street dance, this film paid no respect to formal dance and seemed to even discredit it.This movie failed for me just like almost every porn flick that tried to employ acting and a plot along with the action.

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,leplatypus,,adventure,2013,NA,"Well, i should try for a spot of Hollywood screenwriter, as this movie is just full of absurdities that it's hard to believe that people believe in it. To put it simply, a clean and young graduate is anxious with his future. So far, it's OK as classic did it before (""the graduate"" for example). To bite the life, he hangs up with a free couple during his summer break. Still nothing to blame as this age is indeed for this kind of experience. But, then, crash: the father is Pittsburg's Maffia Don: Why ?? Is it again the problem to be respectable? In all cases, Nolte is a poor godfather and all the clichés are abused. Worst, this triangular friendship evolves not into a threesome but in another homosexuality struck! Even if he ""does"" Sienna, he finally discovers that he prefers his boyfriend and ready to live as a couple of thugs!!! Well, all this homo silly stories by straight people is like having a debate about feminism with only men: it's just unbelievable. However, Sarsgaard is always good for this misfit character and Sienna is sympathetic with her gentle, soft, smiling spirit. And it was good to come back to Pittsburg and unlike ""Flashdance"", this time we have a taste of its rural beaut"
Gran Torino             ,davesteele-milwaukee,0,drama,2009,5,"I'm from the industrial Midwest, and I've known a lot of Walt Kowalskis. Grizzled, white ethnic old-timers who are not PC, whose cars are their first love, and who bemoan the loss of ""their"" neighborhoods, and ""their"" city. I've also known a fair number of kids like Thao, Hmong-American kids trying to make it in a world their parents do not understand. I've known neighborhoods like Walt's: neighborhoods in transition that show signs of decay, but are still lived in and tended to by hard working old timers like Walt and their hard-working immigrant neighbors, whom they don't understand and paint with a broad brush as ""the other."" I was excited to watch Gran Torino because of the rave reviews and its portrayal of this world of which I am so familiar. Sadly, while I appreciated the premise, and was happy to see so many Hmong actors in Hmong roles (rather than ""professional"" non-Hmong Asian actors playing these roles), the movie came up short. I found the dialogue and characters to lack credibility, and the plot too cliché-ridden to be taken seriously. The theme of death and rebirth, brought to us mainly through the fraught relationship of Walt and the young priest, had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer(Did Walt HAVE to come to rest in a Christ-like pose after the shooting in the last scene?! Puh-leeeze.) The ""death-as-sad-and-happy"" thing just never really connected with the larger message of the movie of ""learning to love thy neighbor."" I will cite one example of a relatively minor scene that illustrates this movie's larger problems: In real life, white boys who try to be ""down with the 'hood,"" don't say ""it's all good, bro!"" to some gangbanger they don't know after said gangbanger hits on their girlfriend. Maybe in a movie like ""Strait Outta Malibu"" could that scene have worked, but in this context it was ridiculous and totally not-believable. This seemingly minor miscue threw so much of the movie off, because we're forced to conclude from it that Sue's boyfriend is mentally ill, and if that's the case, what does that say about Sue herself, who is one the most important drivers of the plot? Overall, this film suffers from too many cliché characters and too many cliché plot points to really be anything more than an average movie. Which is a shame, because it could have been so much more, and was a great opportunity for the wider world to get to know the Hmong people and their story. "
Frost/Nixon             ,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,0,misc,2010,8,"The sole reason I did not watch this in the cinema two years ago was that I could not find a theater near me that played it, and I was, as I am now, a busy student. That caused me to have to take breaks in my viewing of it, and I have to say, it was not easy to do so. It is, simply put, immensely gripping, and the ending is pitch perfect. I haven't seen the play, but I understand that this expands upon the people around the two who were engaged in the verbal boxing match, especially Cushing. The two leads are the same, and I can get behind getting them to do both versions. They are immensely talented(they had the material so committed to memory that they only flubbed once each), and Sheen is an absolute chameleon, disappearing entirely into what he portrays(I can just barely believe that he played Lucian in the Underworld trilogy... great job in those, by the way). The cast is fantastic, and everyone really delves into their credible and swiftly developed characters. This manages to not paint anyone as a one-note good or bad guy, and I have to admit, I did not feel any sympathy for the former president before this film. The acting is amazing. Dialog is excellent. A little of it was improvised; so was most of the camera-work, and it helps make it feel dynamic and natural. This builds tension rather well. The drama is compelling. There is a short sequence of disturbing content, infrequent strong language and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track by Howard, a well-done 23 minute behind-the-scenes production, 22 and a half minutes of deleted scenes, and two well-made featurettes of 7 and a half minutes(about the real interview) and six minutes(about the Nixon library), respectively. I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject. 8/"
Deception             ,Chris_Docker,0,crime,2008,5,"Have you ever longed for a bit more excitement in your life? Many of us have. Especially, it seems, introverted and slightly nerdy Jonathan McQuarry, an audit manager played by Ewan McGregor.McGregor is a high flyer, checking the books for top Wall Street firms. There's only one problem. He doesn't have a life. Zero social world, and near zero sexual escapades to look back with his mates. Assuming he had any. Which he doesn't. Accountants are wary of him for the few weeks when he looks at their figures. And to everyone else he's just a temporary fixture.Until smoothly tailored Wyatt Bose breezes onto the scene. A spliff, a game of tennis, and an accidental swapping of mobile phone handsets puts McQuarry in line for more sex, deception and perilous living than Little Red Riding Hood in heat checking out the bear pit.In the opening scene, McQuarry is alone in a majestic Manhattan skyscraper, only the cleaners in the background (behind glass doors). The camera traverses the splendid skylines. All is framed to perfection, both visually and to establish the characters and storyline. So when the plot moves into Basic Instinct territory, you are not surprised to see lovers pictured in postcard perfection. Standing in the rain. Or having is sex in those geometrically interesting positions. And lighting that just happens to show off their lovely skin tones and delicately arranged shadows.Director of photography Dante Spinotti (The Insider, L.A. Confidential, Heat) uses a high-tech Panavision Genesis digital video camera for the night scenes, capturing colours and detail in a way where film falls short. ""The Genesis has a much stronger sensitivity,"" Spinotti explains, ""so it can read in the shadows much more than film does."" I spent much time admiring the photography. It was more interesting than the story. Shifting dodgy funds about electronically is hardly visceral viewing. So we have a mysterious sex-club that McQuarry stumbles into. He meets high-profile women whose lives are too busy for relationships.Queue meaningless sex. No names. No work talk. The initiator, male or female, pays the hotel. The only important words being, ""Are you free tonight?"" McQuarry is emotionally attracted in one encounter <U+0096> against the rules. Her name begins with S. She's blonde, leggy, and played by Michelle Willliams (Brokeback Mountain, She's Not There). Soon the games begin, and you won't be surprised to learn they include blackmail and large amounts of moola.To give Deception its due, the intrigue does develop in ways I hadn't expected. I just wish I could have cared enough about the characters to ignore the plot holes and lack of any real depth or substance. As a thriller, a piece of soft porn, or a character study, Deception is room temperature. Luscious visuals are poor compensation for a contrived and unengrossing story. It passes the time well enough and makes a competent debut feature for director Marcel Langenegger, but Spinotti needs worthier projects and McGregor and Williams need to show that they are serious about acting.Some of the best lines used the f-word <U+0096> so well suited to McGregor's well-modulated and slightly posh voice (when he can maybe seem almost like a more buff version of the very proper Hugh Grant). He sadly he doesn't get to say them, but his co-stars do.Deception makes for a pleasantly titillating hour and a half but, much like a drunken one-night stand, it would be silly to take it too seriously."
W.             ,funkyfry,0,misc,2008,3,"I saw this movie at my friend's insistence, and watching it while drinking a beer seemed more fun than sitting at home. In retrospect, only the beer was worth my time. Not that it's an irredeemably bad film... some of the sections depicting George Bush's early life are interesting, and the whole thing is technically well done. But when the film gets into his presidency, we're treated to impersonations rather than performances.W (Josh Brolin) is the prodigal son of the wealthy and influential Bush family, and the film depicts a series of unfocused episodes or vignettes that led up to his assuming the presidency of the United States. Bush is depicted, probably correctly, as a man virtually without intellectual curiosity. His family life is left very much untouched outside of his relationship to wife Laura, perhaps out of respect for the Bush children who after all did not ask for such scrutiny. I did enjoy the aspects of the story that touched on his relationship with his father, President George Bush (James Cromwell). Nothing else in the film had much interest or gave us much information outside of what's readily available.I think it was a mistake for Oliver Stone to make this film during Bush's presidency, when there is no fresh perspective and when audiences are already so used to seeing the man on TV that attending the theater to see him represented seems pointless. And it not only seems pointless, but in Oliver Stone's rambling and unfocused film it actually is pointless in my opinion. What's the idea behind this film anyway? ""George W. Bush is a human being."" Wow, give the man a cookie. It might be interesting to people decades from now but at this point everything in the film is common knowledge and a lot of the things you see in the film you might as well just watch the original footage on youtube. There are also a lot of jarring performances -- Thandie Newton's take on Condoleeza Rice comes off as cartoonish and silly, and yet Jeffrey Wright's take on Colin Powell seems nothing like the man we've known in public service for decades. It's as if half the performers thought they were doing a re-enactment while the other half were being directed to play it broad from the hip.Oliver Stone deserves the blame for this stinker. I simply cannot fathom why he's considered by so many to be a good director. He had some talent as a screenwriter, but his whole task as director seems to be to produce glossy post-cards of history that probably never happened. He's like a Cecil B DeMille for our times. Not that I doubt the overall points that the film makes about our 43rd president, but more I wonder why anyone feels the need to make them at this point. The film does not address any of the worst aspects of Bush's career in the presidency and lets him off the hook by portraying him as a mere incompetent who was persuaded by Rove and Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) to be a devil's accomplice. Real history must be more complicated than whatever happens in Oliver Stone's head. This film is afraid to step on anyone's toes so it ends up being dull. It should have gone one way or the other -- courted controversy by depicting Bush as a kind of hero or villain. Instead we get a very tepid representation of him as a well-meaning loser. Whether it's close to reality or not should be for historians and true political observers to say, but I don't see much point in basing a film on such a middle of the road interpretation."
The Reader             ,hopek-1,1,drama,2009,10,"Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril. 2"
Summer Hours             ,Michael Fargo,1,drama,2009,10,"I knew nothing of this film when I walked into the theater. It was nothing like I anticipated. ""Claire's Knee"" perhaps? What unfolds through the wonder of Olivier Assayas construction, direction and camera work was an equivalent to Chekhov for me. As generations and values change, what gets lost and left behind isn't only the contents of a summer house (which is the focus of the film). Values of and connections to the past dwindle in the summer twilight, and there's panic, guilt, mourning, release and the dawn of another generation unwound on the screen.My one complaint is the length of the beautiful end piece of the film. It introduces a new set of characters to a degree that I was left wanting more. I would have preferred the film ending with the housekeeper rattling the windows to regain entrance, but this is a small complaint to a masterful film, that's beautifully acted and hypnotic to watch.I overheard someone sitting near me say to the person who had dragged him to the film, ""I'll be sleeping through this one."" Curious, I looked over two-thirds into the film, and he wasn't asleep; he was spellbound, along with the rest of us."
Frost/Nixon             ,bklyn-boylan,0,misc,2009,10,"Before seeing Frost/Nixon, I didn't think much of Ron Howard as a director (both A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13 struck me as no more than mediocre commercial jobs). Despite my long admiration for Frank Langella's work on stage and for Kevin Bacon's work on screen, I expected no more than a moderately OK movie). Underwhelmed by most of the new 2008 movies (f'rinstance, except for Cate Blanchett, Benjamin Button disappointed in every aspect), the best 2 new 2008 movies I saw were Edge of Heaven and Stop-Loss (OK, I'm quirky, so what?). Until Frost/Nixon, that is. Its excellence in every area astonished me. Best movie of the year, best directing, best acting by the male lead, best adaptation. The supporting actors were admirable, especially Kevin Bacon, which came as no surprise (though if I were a voter, my vote for supporting actor would go to Robert Downey). I cannot praise Ron Howard enough for using his commercial skills as solid building blocks for a film partly about people selling entertainment and themselves in a mass medium. Nor can I give enough praise to Langella, whose decades of acting experience paid off in what may be his most challenging role--of a man whose decades of performing for his own audience was, in a way, his own most challenging role"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,notnormal89,1,misc,2008,8,"I just went to a sneak screening of this movie. It was very good. I kind of want to say it was better than the first one. It was heartwarming and funny, and I loved being able to see it ahead of the crowd. I highly recommend this movie. And its got PLENTY of eye candy for all you ladies out there ;) The character development I thought was pretty great. It brings to light subjects, we can all relate to. Friendship, love and its hardships, finding yourself, and it lets you know that no matter what, there is someone somewhere who cares for you. The character of Tibby, I have to say is my favorite. There were some issues with the plot that I had, but nothing bad enough to not tell you to go see it. This is a perfect movie, to see on a girls night out. Get together 3 of your closest friends, and don't forget to bring lots of junk food"
The Ruins             ,cchase,,adventure,2008,8,"You already know the drill. You've seen what this genre can produce before, and you're pretty sure you've seen the best and the worst of it. From bygone days, JUST BEFORE DAWN. HELL NIGHT. MY BLOODY VALENTINE. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. THE HILLS HAVE EYES. THE EVIL DEAD. And from the past couple of decades, HOSTEL. TURISTAS. WRONG TURN. JOY RIDE. And of course, the film to which THE RUINS will probably get the most comparisons, CABIN FEVER. Except instead of being set out in the middle of CHAINSAW territory, now it's an ancient sprawl of Mayan ruins. The fact that Four Beautiful Gen-X'ers are involved is about where the similarities end. Mr. Eli Roth, I'm sorry to inform you that you got served.Because just when you think that THE RUINS is really nothing more than just another yawn-inducing slasher movie, it takes this turn into THE OUTER LIMITS that you don't ever expect it to. And it's so much the better - and more terrifying - for that.Jonathan Tucker (HOSTAGE, Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR), Jena Malone (BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA), Shawn Ashmore (the X-MEN series) and Laura Ramsey (LORDS OF DOGTOWN) star as two best friends and their respective boyfriends on vacation in Mexico, for a period of beaches, booze and ""knockin' da boots"" before Tucker's character, Jeff, takes the educational equivalent of the Bataan Death March: attending med school. The whole nightmare starts pretty simply, as nightmares often do in these things. The two couples meet cute with a German tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson), whose own girlfriend, an archaeologist, has gone to her latest dig with Mathias's brother. He invites his new friends to come with, and since there's not much more excitement to be had, other than getting fit-to-puke drunk on too much cheap tequila, they take him up on his offer.Really. Bad. Move.The Fearless Foursome go to the dig site with Mathias and his friend, Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas) and nothing too alarming or remarkable happens along the way. It's when they get there that the fajitas really hit the fan. Because this set of ruins is no ordinary dig site. And if you have prepared yourself in advance for the ghost of some ticked-off Mayan god ready to rip out the hearts of these intruding Americanos, you are way off-base, my friend. What they find is more insidious, horrific and literally creepy than anything you've seen in a long, LONG time. Kudos must immediately go to Scott Smith, the author of A SIMPLE PLAN, for adapting his page-turner of a runaway bestseller into something that should make Stephen King green with envy. The core idea is not an original one, but the way Smith uses it and his depictions of how it affects the characters involved is Grade-A 100% pure classic horror. Director Carter Smith, with his major movie debut, is great at ratcheting up the scares and the gore quotient as he wrings some pretty genuine performances from his cast.But the nasty creepiness and dread are just the black frosting on this rotting cake. Dig underneath and you get some super bonuses: one scene that will forever make the ""hobbling"" scene from MISERY seem like a Sesame Street cakewalk, and one unbelievably goose-bump raising sequence that will forever have you getting freaked out about your cell phone. I can't tell you why...because the less you know about it, the more terrifying it is. Yes, the creative forces here make the most of milking the themes of isolation, hopelessness and impending death. But it's the HOW, not the why that sets THE RUINS apart from any other movie of its kind that's been made before or since.Right now, I would rank this one right up there with Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT as one of the Top Ten Best Horror Films made in this decade.Gee, in spite of all the remakes still ongoing, maybe there is still some hope for horror after all. I can promise you this much: THE RUINS is as good a description for what your nerves will be like by the climax, as it is the title of a very good horror thriller."
Igor             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,animation,2008,6,"Naturally most fans of The Nightmare Before Christmas who saw this trailer were interested in seeing Igor, it was the dark humor we craved around Halloween, not the typical safe humor used in most children's movies. I couldn't wait to see Igor, we have an awesome cast and what seems like a great story that was made for entertainment. So I saw this opening day with great hopes, but I left the theater a little disappointed, while it's a cute movie and is fun to watch at times, this was technically a failure when it comes to what I was expecting. I thought this was going to be funny and just a delight to watch, but it turned out to be predictable, the animation was mediocre and the humor at times was a little off key with the story. I'm not saying this movie was a total disaster, it's cute, it's worth the look, but like I said, the story doesn't add a special touch to make Igor stand out against other animated films.Igor is... well, and Igor, he's been trained specially for this job to serve a master who doesn't have the screws tightened quite right in his head. Igor doesn't want to be an assistant, he wants to be an inventor, and after one of his master's inventions kills him, Igor sees an opportunity to create the most evil invention of all and finally be respected as an inventor, with the help of his two friends/practice inventions, he creates Eva, a female Frankenstein type of monster who's not exactly monstrous. After trying to brain wash her, she gets the wrong message and wants to become an actress, Igor figures a way for her act evil and win the competition, but realizes that maybe having a heart of gold isn't so bad. But he still has one more problem, another inventor who is trying to take over will do anything to get ahold of Eva and rule the city.This movie is worth the look, I'd just say if you're going to go to the theater for it, I'd recommend a matinée, it's fun for your kids and I will say that there are some fun laughs and despite the story's predictability, it's still enjoyable. You really enjoy the comic relief from the two friends that Igor has, a cat who is immortal and a brain who isn't the smartest tool in the box, but they had great chemistry and gave the scenes some relief on the humor. I did like the movie, but it just didn't stand out to me, seeing it once was enough, I was really pulling for this movie, we need a new fun Halloween movie, but unfortunately Igor doesn't cut the cake.6/1"
The Objective             ,mrorange-20,,horror,2008,8,"The initial comment here, on IMDb, left me a tad more in thought that the poster had failed to see multiple aspects of the movie. WIth that idea, I saw it. I found myself to be correct. The movie was,over , very well written and directed. If kept you on the edge of your seat,it kept you guessing and it kept you thinking. Several people seem to stare at a screen and consider that ""watching"" a movie. That is what children do :) Several parts are given to you throughout the movie to answer any questions you have at the end. Several people whom have posted here and on other sites seem to fail to grasp that.Without giving away anything, just absorb the movie. It will explain the end and how things are as they are.I voted the movie an 8. Original concept,good directing and fairly decent acting. Well worth watching if your a thinker, if your a screen staring movie ""watcher"" you will be left bewildered and dumbfounded :)"
Trucker             ,nannycat888,1,drama,2013,NA,"As a Truck Driver for 23 years, I found this movie & the acting wonderful!!!! I am a little concerned that the ""normal public"" will not see the depth of these characters. I am also concerned that female drivers will be considered as less then the wonderful people they are. I would like to have seen more of the hard working and the very giving nature of the typical truck driver. Yes, life as a driver can harden a person, but there is usually a reason and I am not sure that this film has shown that. I wish that this film would have been promoted more than it has been. It truly deserves A lot more recognition for the superb acting done by all!!!"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,bethreidy-1,1,misc,2008,3,"All I can say is very disappointing especially if you read the novel.First, I think this a case of not, Truth is stranger than fiction, but I think far more interesting. I don't really understand why they chose to change history where they did. For example, I believe Henry attended Mary's wedding and that was were he became ""enchanted"" with her or at least met her. Well what is more dramatic that deciding to begin an affair with a woman you met at her wedding to another man? They forgot the ""sweats"" and obviously Mary's husbands death. They completely downplayed Katherine of Aragon and the turmoil of the divorce on the country.Second, the story was suppose to be from Mary's point of view, but somehow became more about Anne than Mary. I also think this may be where you can allow for more historical discrepancy, based on this being from a lesser know point of view. Perhaps Anne wasn't really so ambition on her own, but maybe from Mary's point of view she was. Anne did after all take ""charge"" of her son.I think the time table of this movie was terrible. They should have found a period of the book and concentrated on that and really built the characters and the story (if that had happened can you say sequel). Funny to think I thought the 'Tudors' series was even going to far with the timeline they crammed into Season 1 let alone to have about 10 to 15 years of history stuffed into 2 hours.The main things I really enjoyed from the book, which is the character development of Mary as she matures from a girl to a woman and a mother and how her priorities changed were completely missing. This may or may not be historically accurate, but I thought her struggles with liking Queen Katherine and being loyal to her family were interesting. As well as her struggle and desire to be with her children. And finally falling in love with someone considered lesser in status and deciding love was worth being disowned.I could go on with how the differences between the novel and the movie, but the biggest disappointment was this was suppose to be Mary's story told from her point of view and that didn't happen at all. And I think they cast from the 'Tudors' is far better suited for each character than those chosen for this movie, with potentially the exception of Mary, because they put no real focus on her in the series.PS.. within the first 15 minutes of the watching the DVD, I began reading reviews on this site and found them more interesting than the actual movi"
35 Shots of Rum             ,tomgillespie2002,0,drama,2011,NA,"Claire Denis' 35 Shots Of Rum is a sombre and humane look at a quartet of Parisians who experience loneliness, isolation and disconnection. Lionel (Alex Descas) is a train driver who lives with his daughter Josephine (Mati Diop). He has a seemingly casual relationship with taxi driver Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue) who seems invested in the relationship to a much greater degree than Lionel. And Noe (Gregoire Colin) who lives alone with his cat seems to have an interest in Josephine. The trouble is that all these characters are so wrapped up in their own loneliness, they fail to communicate with one another.They are so wrapped up, however, that it takes their car to break down in the rain for them to open up to each other. Whether this is a good thing or not is a different question. Denis shoots the film in a desolate manner that has a complete (and fitting) lack of flair, which is a direct metaphor for the characters emotional emptiness. Claire Denis has named Japanese master Yasijuro Ozu as a main influence for the film, and it is quite obvious. The quiet, restrained dignity of Lionel, and the almost silent exchanges between the characters mirror Ozu's classics Late Spring and Tokyo Story. The film can be slow at time, but stick with it and it is richly rewarding. A complex film that is powerfully acted.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.c"

Their father, The King, intended to represent God, sends the ""Help Seeker"" which, in my opinion, was intended to represent the Holy Spirit. Then, the Help Seeker chooses three misfits, who are portrayed as losers for the most part, the most unlikely of choices to help.

WALL·E             ,dragongirl346,0,animation,2008,10,"I went in to this movie with very high expectations, having anticipated it since I saw the first previews. Pixar blew me through the roof. From the opening star-scape with ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" playing cheerily in the background, to the closing credits, this movie is in an utter masterpiece. There's never a dull moment in this beautiful film. The audience is taken through such a vast range of emotions, ranging from the pure joy of discovery, to the near-hopeless sense of defeat. Director Andrew Stanton has done it again, adding WALL-E on top of his previous Pixar success, Finding Nemo. Nemo was originally my favorite Pixar film. But then along came this little robot, who tore my heartstrings clear out of my chest and took his rightful place at the top of my favorite films list."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,male_j08,0,drama,2008,8,"I had been awaiting to see this movie for some time. Alas, it was Christmas Day and you bet I was there to see the movie on opening day. I set my expectations really high on this film. I expected nothing short of brilliance with a film coming from director David Fincher, director of the masterful ""Zodiac"" and screenwriter Eric Roth, writer of the classic ""Forrest Gump"". The acting is brilliant in the movie. Brad Pitt and the marvelous Cate Blanchett share a fire that resonates so effortlessly out to the audience. Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson's as Benjamin's mother, and Tilda Swinton's as Benjamin's first lover. Another notable achievement in the film is the visual effects; none of it is overdone and it is quite convincing. The music in the film is great as well. The haunting and mythical music is composed by Alexandre Desplat. One thing that did surprise me in the film was the amount of comedy present, but I guess comedy's needed for a tale with such sorrow. I really do think that this film is a classic. And I would go and see it again. When I was walking out of the theater, some people complained that the movie was very good, but that it was too long. I disagree; I actually didn't want it to end. It's the perfect film to watch all snuggled up in a blanket during the dead of winter. All things aside, this movie is about the short time we're given with life and how we are to make the most of it. Even with a story as fictional as Benjamin Button's, the message rings true. 3"
Saw V             ,Movieboy_20,0,crime,2008,4,"Saw V was a decent film, but sadly it is nothing compared to the first 4 and is the weakest of the lot.I felt the acting was very poor at times from most of the cast, but Tobin Bell still managed a very good performance as the sick and twisted ""Jigsaw"", it's a shame he didn't get much screen time.The other problem I had with the film was that it didn't really feel like a saw film while watching, it seemed like they wanted to focus on the drama more than the actual traps. But with saying that, the main game with Malick, Brit, Luba, Charles and Ashley is VERY well done and entertaining, it's a shame they didn't show it more.Overall, this is a pretty good film, with a bit of a let down ending (but still shocking).PS. The rating would have been higher if they focused on the group game more. "
The Express             ,jbuttlar,,misc,2008,8,"This was a very well acted movie. Dennis Quaid did a great job of playing the coach and Rob Brown was the perfect choice for Ernie Davis. The ratings this movie has received so far are not in line with the quality of this film. This movie in no way presented a political point of view. The only thing political was what happened in real life. This was the recognition given to Ernie by the president of the time. (which was JFK) Other than this movie was more inspirational. It showed the character of Ernie Davis and the faith he had in his own abilities, his coach, family and his God. Ernie Davis has reshaped College sports. Due to his ability to cope with hatred and racism in a positive way. The game of college sports has vastly become more professional. The talent of teams today is far greater than the past. Ernie opened the door foe all races in sports; thus increasing the abilities of the teams. I highly recommend this film."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,sergepesic,0,crime,2011,NA,"Small town Denmark, bleak countryside, unfriendly hicks. That's the setting of this quirky, dark and twisted little movie. The director, Henrik Ruben Genz, is toying with the western genre. Guys in jeans, stetson hats, the town policemen called Marshall, and the very specific and macabre sense of justice in an isolated little community. "" Terribly Happy "" is an interesting flick, obviously inspired with the Coen brother's artistic madness. Characters in this skewed dark comedy are sharp and without subtlety, that would definitely slow down the intended message.All in all, an original, hard to pin down movie, which est ethic just is not my cup of te"
One Missed Call             ,bestrob263,0,horror,2008,1,"This was without doubt the worst and most disappointing movie I have ever seen in the cinema. I'm not a big horror fan, but I figured I'd try this out since the previews made it actually look like a movie. This movie deserves to be on the top of the WORST MOVIES list and can easily be one of the worst movies of 2008. I'm not going to get deep into the storyline, but let's just say it was a funny movie. If you're looking for a comedy see this, because this was the most pathetic piece of trash. This is not in the least scary and the storyline was beyond awful. They get a call hearing their death. They wander randomly around the street seeing weird faces. They die. Repeat. The ending will make you laugh the hardest. I think I lauged harder in this movie than in Superbad. Biggest waste of 10 bucks ever. Stay home and watch SAW."
Good Dick             ,Jimmy_Ray,1,misc,2008,8,"I admit, at first the title of this film put me off a little, but figured I'd give it a go anyway and I am so glad I did.The Directing and Cinematography of this beautifully crafted film are outstanding, some of the shots are beautifully constructed and make the film a joy to watch. The pace of the story is sometimes a little too slow (which is the only reason I have given it 8/10 as opposed to full marks) but overall it moves from one moment to the next giving you enough time to consider what is happening without running off and not allowing you time to understand what is going on.Palca and Ritter play their roles superbly (though you never find out their names) and you genuinely warm to both the lead characters ably supported by the rest of the cast.It is not your typical ""boy meets girl, she's not keen but he wins her heart eventually"" story, at times you genuinely feel for Ritters character as he struggles to win his girls heart (and even think it might be better for him to give up) whist she continually rebukes him and discourages him at every possible opportunity.It is a film that everyone who has ever tried to win the heart of someone can relate to. Another wonderful element of this picture is that you never really know what time period it is being conducted over (although you get the impression that it is a course of months).As the film moves forward you realise that both characters have had destructive pasts and are dealing with them the best way possible and whist you never are told what happened to Palca's character there is subtle nods that lead you to make your own decisions.On the whole I left ready to trumpet the beauty of this film to my friends and co-workers (happily going to see it again if they cant find anyone else to go with them) and will definitely be getting the DVD when it is released.I cant recommend this film strongly enough, go and watch it and then tell everyone you know to watch it too"
Flash of Genius             ,chaitov,0,misc,2008,9,"I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this movie! There was NEVER a moment when I felt bored,uninterested,or confused about the plot.It is based on the true story of Dr.Bob Kearns from Detroit Michigan.The casting,I felt was perfect and Greg Kinnear definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as Dr.Bob Kearns, an engineer and inventor. His wife,played by Phyllis Graham,was the typical wife of the 50's. And her performance was also top notch..not over or underacted, but right on cue. I absolutely loved the clothes, decor and cars of that era..really brings back memories..the little blue ""frigidaire"", ""mixmaster"", and chrome kitchen set along with the rotary phones,and huge ""boat cars.""(we would call them that) Life seemed so simple then. Mom stayed home and looked after the kids, cooked,and took care of her husband while dad brought home the ""bacon.""But things changed when Dr. Kearns stubbornly refused to give up his pursuit of justice when he felt he had been wronged by Ford Motor Company. The script is excellent and performances great. Even Alan Alda played the lawyer part very believable. I saw the movie a couple of hours ago and still feel so ""Up' having finally seen a movie with No special effects,No digitalization,No remake, but just a GOOD,GOOD STORY that happens to be true.Although Dr.Kearns died in 2005, he definitely made the case for following your instincts and seeking the truth.We CAN fight city hall and all the money in the world will not make up for that vindication, even though it is a tough road with many losses by the wayside.Listen,if you are tired of all the Superhero,Violent,Sex-driven,and Mind-Numbing Stupid movies out today,this is a very refreshing change, and All Ages will appreciate the solid entertainment and heart-warming storytelling! Digital is great but a good storyline is something we can all relate to for sure!!"
The Strangers             ,bennyhagen,,horror,2010,4,"The first 45 minutes are quite intense, the whole setup just works fine and the simple but effective cinematography is nice to watch. Though I was not really convinced by Speedman's attempt to reflect intense emotions, you can always rely on Liv Taylor, who is - given a rather thin piece of script - really working her ass off to get the most out of it. Congratulations for that. The mocking ""Strangers"" start off being quite scary and the concept seems to be somewhat more original then we probably got used too, so it all seems like we're going to have a good time, but then suddenly everything freezes in the most inelegant manner, as the makers seemingly just ran out of any kind of idea how to continue this promising movie. That means, there is almost literally NOTHING new happening from around minute 45, it feels writer and director Bryan Bertino had half a decent script and then needed to finish it in about 2 hours due to a deadline or something. So the other 45 minutes are basically prolonging 2 jump scares and 3 lines of really basic dialog with minimum creativity, like lights turning off and the after a few minutes on again for no obvious reason, till the point where some kind of climax should occur, which then never really happens. Instead we get something really unrefined and boring featuring not a bit of fantasy, it's just like no one really cared anymore.I'd recommend though watching the first half of the movie and then striding around in some dark forest for a while, that surely does the job much better. 4/10"
Kisses             ,DICK STEEL,1,drama,2010,NA,"Written and directed by Lance Daly, Kisses is one of those little enjoyable gems that had its main leads breathe life to a fairly simple plot of a road movie of sorts, set around Christmas in the streets of Dublin, following the adventures of two children Dylan (Shane Curry) and Kylie (Kelly O'Neill), neighbours who decide to run away from their dreadful family members, and spiteful peers with whom they cannot clique.Told in three main acts and bookended by black and white cinematography used to highlight the bleakness of their family lives full of constant bickering, violence, and an unspeakable act which will be revealed, these two loner kids find some common ground to want to escape together to the big unknown, with nary a clue and only a wad of cash which they bust on material goods.Like a typical road movie, the people they meet become episodic scenes in which the film got made up of, some extended, like the friendly boat man they meet early in their adventures, right down to the seedy kidnappers who take a fancy at Kylie, either for personal pleasure or for some money making scheme, and some fleeting, such as the surreal chancing of a Bob Dylan lookalike (played by Stephen Rea). It's a spectrum of the nice and the nasties, and the duo have only each other to help look out for, while trying to search for Dylan's long longs brother with whom they hope will take them in.It's a somewhat short feature film that becomes something like a travelogue where we get to see both the glitzier side of Dublin, and the stark nakedness of its grit, from unsavoury back alleys, to sub-urban neighbourhoods as we follow the kids in their attempt to survive on their own. Being short in run time, it managed to hold your attention throughout thanks to the wonderfully charismatic performances by the child actors Shane Curry and Kelly O'Neill, especially the latter as the vulnerable yet spunky Kylie who's more street smart than the dazed Dylan, and its indeed a wonder how she can actually fall for him.One of my personal favourite scenes would be the ending, with its surreal like moments in slow motion, and the wry smile that both of them exchange, in acknowledging their relationship is now at a different plane, coupled with that tinge of mischief that they've had quite an adventure and had a good run. While being very foul mouthed, I thought the parting shot was oh-so-sweet, that it made you want more, just like how Kisses in the film got explained as something to be given or taken, with that desire and craving to go at it all over again.Don't be put off by the thick Irish accent, as the film comes with English subtitles so that you can follow the humour, and adventures of two kids on the run from weariness, for that adventure of a lifetime. Recommended!"
A Christmas Tale             ,stensson,1,comedy,2008,8,"This is an extremely dysfunctional family. Everybody seems to be aware of their part in it and don't really care.The great engine is the alcoholic son, who provokes everyone. One tool is the fact that his mother's got cancer and he and his nephew are the only one who can save her. The alcoholic uses it for attacks on the family and not at least the mother. And the characters are forced to develop, not necessarily for the better.The humor keeps you interested in this chamber play and the 145 minutes never feel long. A quite French movie, but fully appreciable for all of us. A Christmas tale which is both dark and light."
"Surfer, Dude             ",rtg002,0,comedy,2009,9,"I recently had the chance to see this movie, and I don't understand why so many people hate it. I don't think that this film was intended to be a deep think-piece. The people who have come on here complaining about the film seem to have missed the message, which is a shame, because they are the ones who could have benefited from the films laid back messages the most. Addington lives a perfect, untainted existence. He is free of all of the stress and flakiness (for lack of a better word) that permeates modern American life and culture. This movie helped me realize that relaxing and enjoying the things that bring joy to my life are equally, if not more important, than participating in the gigantic rat race that has come to dominate all aspects of modern day life. I admire this movie and its simplistic message, and to those who felt this movie was a waste of time, I would recommend relaxing and appreciating the stress free atmosphere that is present throughout the film."
Yes Man             ,jon.h.ochiai,0,comedy,2009,9,"""Yes Man"" is surprisingly good, and here the punch line is everything. Jim Carrey is great in Director Peyton Reed's hysterical romantic comedy. Zooey Deschanel is amazingly charming and quirky. In ""Yes Man"" Carrey plays Carl, who has been divorced for 3 years from Stephanie (flighty and hot Molly Sims) and has an uninspired job as a loan officer at Brea Savings in Los Angeles. Carl has pretty much checked out in life. To that end he says ""No"" to all invites. Carl even forgets to attend his best friend Peter's (funny Bradley Cooper) engagement party. An old buddy invites Carl to a seminar given by Tony Robbins-like self help guru Terrence Bundley (charismatic Terrence Stamp). Terrence invites Carl to accept the ""covenant"" to say ""Yes"" to everything in life. Reluctantly, Carl accepts.However, there is a point to the screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel based on the book by Danny Wallace. In a great conversation with Carl and Terrence later in the story Carl asks, ""So this is bullsh*t?"" Carl has been so not present in his own life. Obviously, saying ""Yes"" mindlessly to everything is ridiculous. What if taking on saying ""Yes"" as an operating practice is a way of practicing being enrolled in life. When you are enrolled in life, and become enrolling, you are now open to a new realm of possibility. Reed and his writers present this transformed perspective in both a hysterical and touching manner.Saying ""Yes"" immediately does not seem to make a difference for Carl. Carl ends up giving a ride and all of his money to Homeless Guy (funny Brent Briscoe). With his cell phone dead and his car empty on gas, Carl ventures miles to a gas station where he meets free-spirited scooter girl Allison (Deschanel). Allison gives Carl a ride, and leaves an indelible mark on his heart. In not the most linear or obvious ways, Carl soon embraces saying ""Yes"". Peter asks, ""So you say 'yes' to everything?"" Carl confesses, ""I wasn't open to stuff. Now I am<U+0085>"" Carl eventually is fated to meet up with Allison. Carl tells Peter that ""<U+0085>She is so not me."" There in lies the genius. There is a quiet moment at the Hollywood Bowl where Allison tells Carl, ""The whole world is a playground. Somewhere along the way everyone forgets that<U+0085>"" Here Reed is unexpectedly poignant. Carrey and Zooey's sweet and funny chemistry give ""Yes Man"" its big heart.""Yes Man"" is hysterical. Carrey is at his best playing outrageous comedic with an underlying humanity, instead of straight up serious drama. He is amazingly hysterical as he serenades a Jumper (funny Luis Guzman), takes a drunken beating from an angry boyfriend, and jacked up on Red Bull in a jogging photography class. Zooey Deschanel is Carrey's amazing romantic foil. There is a nice scene as she and Carrey walk side by side along a barren Nebraska road. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit and vulnerability. So her Allison must touchingly reconcile for herself whether Carl is just saying ""Yes"". ""Yes Man"" is about what's in your heart and being open to all the possibilities of life. That's not a bad message for a hilarious and outrageous comedy from Jim Carrey and Peyton Reed. Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man""."
Julia             ,druid333-2,1,crime,2009,9,"I have been an admirer of Tilda Swinton,since I first saw her in some of Derek Jarman's films,and moving on to acting in some mighty toothsome film fare after Jarman's untimely death due to complications from AIDS. Not only can she take on some roles in what could be considered ""difficult"" films,but she can fake an American accent quite well. Erick Zonka ('The Dreamlife Of Angels',The Little Thief') directs & co writes the screenplay (with Aude Py)about a self destructive 40 something,full blown alcoholic party girl,named Julia who's party girl days should have been behind her years ago. When she is ordered to attend an AA meeting by one of her best friends (played by veteran Canadian actor,Saul Rubinek), she meets up with a psychologically disturbed woman named Elena (played to the max by Kate Del Castillo),who wants Julia to kidnap her eight year old son from her Grandfather. Julia,with nothing to lose (and equally nothing to gain)is at first reluctant to go along with this scheme,but eventually goes along for the ride. What transpires is a botched kidnapping that goes from bad to worse to truly unbearable. Toss in an unintended trip to Mexico,and watch the fire get turned up to full 10. Comparisons to John Cassavete's film, 'Gloria' will be noted. Rated 'R'by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive raunchy language (both in English & Spanish),adult content & nudity & graphic,bloody violence. Leave the kiddies home"
A Christmas Tale             ,writers_reign,1,comedy,2008,7,"Clearly in one respect at least a disciple of Jacques Rivette, Arnaud Desplechin doesn't do brief. Presumably he sees anything under two hours as a one-reeler and tends to deliver around two and a half hours as a mean average. He also has a tendency to use actors over and over - for example Manu Devos, Mathieu Amlaric and Catherine Deneuve all appeared in Kings and Queen, albeit Deneuve was little more than a cameo there whilst she here she gets centre stage as the matriarch of a dysfunctional family that makes Gene O'Neill's haunted Tyrones look like the Waltons. Whatever you may think of the plot and length you can't fault the acting and Anne Consigny is especially effective as the elder sister metaphorically wearing Masha Black in mourning for her life. It's a great big roller-coaster ride of a movie and ultimately rewarding"
The Dark Knight             ,filmquestint,0,action,2008,10,"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want. 4"
Street Kings             ,jaredmobarak,,misc,2008,6,"What I love about David Ayer's work is that he is unpredictable and unafraid to tell a story in all its brutality. From his penned script Training Day to his directorial debut in Harsh Times, we are treated with bad men and worse men, doing what they need to survive and not worrying about the consequences. When I saw the trailer for his new film Street Kings, I thought I'd be in for a three-peat, but I should have looked at the writing credits. Don't get me wrong, I like James Ellroy and Kurt Wimmer, I enjoy much of their work, however, knowing Ayer's catalog makes me believe that it was their fault why I did not love this film. The aesthetic is there, the language is there, and the violence is never shied away from, but the story itself never surprises. You will be able to see what will happen straight from the getgo and unfortunately that just isn't what I'm used to seeing with Ayer. I expected more and hopefully for his next film he won't go gun-for-hire and write his own new urban street tale.Don't be fooled by the trailer, this is not a story about a corrupt cop on his day to day jaunts busting heads and covering his tracks. It's about the good cop that has lost his faith, while he may go against the rules, he will only do it for the right reasons; he hasn't gone completely off the deep end. No, it's those around him that are lost and he must find two cop killers when everyone just wants to let it go in order to save his skin. True he wants the cover up to keep his job, but he also wants justice for his ex-partner, a man he began to dislike but a man he loved and would not let die in vain. In effect, then, we are treated to a much slower paced plot then you may want as he goes out on his own to solve the case off the books. More a straightforward cop drama then a crazy shoot-em-up, we are shown this one story thread through to its inevitable conclusion. It's all tidied up with a bow, villains explain the whole plan like the old cliché goes, and we get closure. Ayer, you aren't supposed to be so cut and dry, what happened? Being such a by the numbers tale also means sacrificing a lot of character development. Roles like Naomie Harris' are throwaways, putting a name actress in a small part with no real substance. The same goes for Hugh Laurie, third billed and quite entertaining, but does his Captain Biggs have any real need to be there? You could have put any guy off the street in that role and it would have served its purpose as a MacGuffin to be explained later. And how about Common? The guy owns his five minutes of screen time; it's just a shame that is all he is allowed. Not to mention John Corbett who doesn't even get a billing on IMDb, now that's just strange.The acting is great overall though. Forest Whitaker is a bit too showy for me, but I love the guy so I give him a pass; Chris Evans is top-notch as usual, hopefully a true breakthrough role is coming for him; and Jay Mohr comes out of nowhere playing the aged Sgt. without any of his trademark wit. Even Cedric the Entertainer comes in shedding any comedic preconceptions. He plays his not-so-bad thug sounding like Terrance Howard in Hustle and Flow; I was shockingly impressed. The guy that holds it all together, though, is Keanu Reeves. I know people hate the guy, but I think he is solidly perfect here. He has the dejection and death sentence look about him, taking the kills for himself so that his partners don't have to live with the guilt. He knows what he does is wrong, but he does it because he believes he has to. Sometimes to keep the city safe, you have to bend the rules. Reeves looks weathered and beat-down here, totally believable as the cop looking to do right despite his actions. Real good stuff.So, well directed and well acted, but yet not that great? Doesn't seem to make sense, yet that's my feeling. All the good stuff tries to overcompensate for the generic, lackluster story. One thing about cinema, though<U+0097>and maybe the writers strike was worth it, even though those wanting the strike for more money were mostly the hacks, the true auteurs already get the cash<U+0097>a good script overcomes all and a bad one cannot be saved. Unfortunately this one never goes that extra mile to be completely unique and the performances just fall into place when necessary rather than enhancing to bring the tale to new heights. If you haven't seen it yet, go rent Harsh Times, save this one for a rental in a few months instead."

Street Kings             ,eclecticderby,,misc,2008,7,"It's a well crafted film, with very good gun fighting scenes that tends to become a bit overboard, but still realistic enough. The story is predictable, but satisfying enough without being over complicated.The main thing that make this movie better than many mediocre gangster films is Forest Whitaker. It's sad that he only got so little on screen time.My favorite scene is not the gunfights and action scenes. It is the final showdown in the film. A true testament to the acting prowess of Forest Whitaker. He simply steal the thunder and lift the show single handedly.Reeves on the other hand played out his character (a cop with moral dilemma) with the usual broodiness, seen-it-all personality. Pretty much like in Constantine. A well acted, believable character. Watch this movie if you happened to walk into the cinema one weekend with nothing in mind."
The Square             ,cheryllynecox-1,0,crime,2010,10,"With cheap Christmas stuff coiled around most of it's Aussie edges, ""The Square"" was suspenseful and fun to watch. The stupidity of the main characters, like most film noir, set-up a nasty sequence of events that become complicated by twisted motives and coincidental plot developments. Our main character, Ray Yale, is as pathetic as his mistress, Carla Smith, is desperate, and we know that they're both going to suffer some heavy consequences for their selfishness. Still, we hardly imagine that so much is going to go so brilliantly wrong.The director, Nash Edgerton, must have enjoyed playing with all the production values of ""The Square"" as much as his brother, Joel, enjoyed writing the story upon which the screenplay evolved. I mean, really, can anyone think of a better name for a contemporary interpreter of the genre than a chap named Nash Edgerton? Not only did we get the usual dark images and sweaty brows, but Edgerton was also able to provide a shaggy dog and a baby, too! ""The Square"" is a film that should entertain most people who enjoy the film noir genre."
The Lucky Ones             ,benbree,,adventure,2009,10,"This is excellent. This movie is a great example of how those in the military take care on one another. After my five years of military service as a Marine, I have found no other organization that works so well. This was a great example of how we (those in the military) get it done each and every day. It also illustrates that in the military we learn to work with both men and women and all colors. It is a simple matter of what is required to get the job done. Thanks for a good example of life in and out of the military.The characters were true to form and based on my experience showed the way it really is as one tries to adapt and adjust to live after returning from a deployment. It was so smart to include a woman and to write the lines in such a way to show that she was an equal. While only a newbie to the military, she demonstrated life experiences and knowledge that helped the more senior members of the cast. A great job of balancing and showing that life experiences help those in the military deal with situations.I do not think I can say enough how much I enjoyed watching this movie and experiences the life of military members through the characters in this film. Again, great job!"
What Happens in Vegas             ,themegster88,1,comedy,2008,3,"The poster says 'get lucky' - sadly I didn't with this film. The premise is simple: drunken people get married in Vegas, but can't get annulled for some 'crazy' reason. ALA: Friends, Laws Of Atraction and many more. Diaz and Kutcher are both lacking something in this film. Diaz (again) relies on shaking her booty and being the same ditzy character that she is in so many of her films, but I felt this lacked the pizazz of her earlier films, such as The Sweetest Thing and Charlies Angels. Kutcher falls into the same 'pretty boy' trap of being a roguishly attractive man, and this role (and film) are almost identical to his 2003's Just Married - but this film is worse. The film was just off in so many places, displaced laughs, ongoing jokes that aren't funny, and the compulsory 15 minutes of immature escalating pranks. Most of the 'laughs' are in the trailer. What Happens In Vegas... takes its time getting to the conclusion, too much time, for a normal ending. At least this film knows what it is, and it doesn't reach for the stars.

Nim's Island             ,frozenbiscuits-1,1,adventure,2008,6,"this is one of those films, that manages to walk a thin line between parody( but not with a mean streak) and true family entertainment.my next thought might well spoil things for some, so please take caution, though I won't give away any specifics. I liked it, but for all the reasons I would normally not like a film so much... in places it does have emotional grappling hooks- yet it is a cacophony of formula, cliché, new twist on an old theme,Evertything about it has been done, it's like all the best elements from other stories that worked have been haphazardly combined into one family movie that stops just short of parody but yet you know it kind of is . sort of a Dr. Doolittle, meets, romancing the Stone, meets, the swiss family Robinson... too many to mention. and then throw in a few scenes that can make any one who has ever been a tourist or part of pop culture that has been lured by the idea of "" your own paradise"" uncomfortable. ( and yes, it never turns out well for those who live there.) for all the reasons it shouldn't have worked for me, it did work, on some unexpected level. I liked it"
Slumdog Millionaire             ,aharmas,0,drama,2008,10,"Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.The tale of two brothers' lives is told to us through episodic flashbacks tied to an episode of India's ""Who Wants to be a millionaire?"". At first, the story introduces one of the brothers as being the subject of a very strong interrogation to find out whether he is being truthful about some knowledge that might be relevant to the game. As he answers the questions, we discover that this young man's life story might be more interesting than we originally expected.There is an element of freshness in the way the story is presented, as we accompany Jamal through his life odyssey from a young child in the slums to a man who is determined to save those he loves. There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging.Prepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium. He knows that the perfect mix of a great story and the respective imagery can provoke unforgettable memories in its audience. 5"
The Burning Plain             ,Argemaluco,1,misc,2010,5,"Do not misunderstand me...I like to see a Mexican going through the cultural barrier to infiltrate himself in the ""star system"" from Hollywood.I only wish that screenwriter and more recently also director Guillermo Arriaga would prove different things.He only did it once, with the excellent film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and he may back to do it in the future, but for now, his debut as a director The Burning Plain, employs his classic formula: a tremulous drama of a simple narrative unnecessarily complicated by a fragmented structure in order to simulate ingenuity and deepness...exactly the same as his previous screenplays for Amores Perros, Babel and 21 Grams.I am not against the non-linear narrative style.In many occasions, it brought unusual and fascinating movies as a result (such as, for example, Pulp Fiction or Mulholland Dr.); but when the trick is an end by itself, the experience becomes into a dull march to the final revelations, where the relationships between the characters and the connections of causes and consequences are finally concreted.The problem in The Burning Plain is that those revelations can be figured out much before the screenplay deigns itself to confess them, so we only witness scene by scene of drama, betrayal and suffering, hoping for something (whatever it is) to make us get interested in the movie.And, in my case, that ""something"" never came, so the result was a pretentious, boring and unsatisfactory film.However, I have to admit Arriaga could extract excellent performances from his cast.Kim Basinger and Charlize Theron made a remarkable work, and I think that José María Yazpik, Tessa Ia and Joaquim de Almeida are also worthy of applause.Their performances are so good that I wished they had better material to work with.However, I cannot recommend The Burning Plain, because I found it to be tedious from the beginning to the end."
The Ruins             ,dbborroughs,,adventure,2008,8,"One of the better horror films of recent years, is creepy and scary and the sort of thing that makes your skin crawl. Its a simple story- several tourists go to a temple in the Mexican jungle that happens to be off the beaten path. There is of course something there and the locals are not happy about visitors. I won't say more since I'm going tempted to tell you way too much...which would be too much since the plot is simple. Its almost too simple. The reason the film works is that the film has decent characters and it does things that are decidedly not your typical horror movie choices. Its short, its sweet and it works. Its not perfect, there are one or two things I didn't like, but on the whole its a very good very creepy film. Frankly while Brazil got upset about Touristas a year because it might make think people about going there, Mexico should worry since this film will make anyone think again about going into ancient ruins. (7.5 ish out of 10 on the horror scale because thinking about the screams makes my skin crawl) "
Space Chimps             ,neil-476,,animation,2008,6,"This CGI animated movie is not complex or sophisticated. It is a simple story of very clever chimps, full of human characteristics, being sent through a space warp to a planet full of aliens, and emerging triumphant. It is aimed at kids, although there are gags in it for adults. It is bright and colourful, the characters (humans, chimps and aliens) are all engaging, the alien world is imaginative, the action flows well, the dialogue is fun, and the story is easy to follow.If I sound a little half-hearted, then it's because I am. Despite all the good things listed above, the movie itself comes across as a little half-hearted. The animation, for instance, while adequate, isn't up to the standard we've become used to in CGI features. The voice cast perform OK, but aren't particularly high profile (Jeff Daniels and Stanley Tucci are the top names). And there's at least one matter which we expected to see resolved before the end, but which is still hanging loose.I enjoyed it, but was left feeling....The kids loved it, though."
21             ,Carycomic,0,crime,2008,1,"I went to see this movie, earlier this afternoon, because Kevin Spacey and Lawrence Fishburne were in it. And, any film in which they appear is pretty good, more often than not. This film, however, was one of the ""not's.""I mean; the premise was initially intriguing. And, some of the banter thrown about, by the various characters, was surprisingly somewhat funny! But, past the ninety-minute mark, I began to get bored. I actually ceased caring about Ben Campbell!His gradual transformation from ""the Anakin Skywalker of MIT"" to ""the Darth Vader of black-jack"" was so predictable, to describe the rest of the film as ""less-than-riveting"" would be putting it charitably. So, I walked out. Completely uninterested in knowing whether or not Ben got the girl and/or the Harvard medical scholarship. Nor will I waste any money on the eventual DVD to find out.In short: the early promise shown by this movie gets broken really fast. And, not even Messrs. Spacey and Fishburne can change that."
Garden Party             ,siderite,1,drama,2015,NA,"I will also compare this with Crash, but in a positive way. Crash touched a lot of real issues, but had really crappy characters. Garden Party is not so much focused on a cohesive story, but has interesting protagonists. Also, I have to say that I believe the message to be slightly different. While Crash was about people touching other people's lives and actions having consequences, Garden Party is more about the transience of any relationship and the insignificance of its characters.Indeed, I believe the story of this film was not about the people in it as much as it was about how interesting people can make a story interesting when the underlying mechanism doesn't care about or need any of them. Or maybe it was just the mood I was in. This film presents actions like prostitution, posing for sexy pictures, selling drugs and even kidnapping and battery as normal things that people do randomly to reach their goals and live their dreams.Unless, of course, I just found Vinessa Shaw gorgeous and I am rating this high because I be horn"
Death Race             ,C-Younkin,0,action,2008,5,"""Death Race"" was written and directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a filmmaker whose toiled away trying to make the perfect movie based on a video game. I'll give you a few moments to process that before I say<U+0085>yeah, that's right, he's made some really terrible movies. ""Death Race"" actually looks sort of fun though, definitely a racing film that will erase the memory of the ""Speed Racer Technicolor Dream-Coat"" at least, and Jason Statham is usually so good in movies like this that he'd make ""Fast and the Furious"" look like ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" all by himself. This may be Anderson's first real entertaining movie, but there has been some question as to whether it really is his movie. Writer Adam Stone says Anderson stole his work, leading to some speculation of plagiarism and possibly to a denied wide release. So there are two questions, one of course will be answered if your reading this review and the other will be is this movie even worth stealing in the first place? Statham stars as Jensen Ames, a former professional racer turned Steel-mill worker. It's the future, 2012, and work is hard to find. Ames is laid off from the steel-mill and when he comes home, his wife is murdered by a masked assailant and he is framed for it. Months later he finds himself in Terminal Prison, the bitch to a domineering warden named Hennessey (Joan Allen). Since the prison system has become overcrowded, the prison participates in a death race, a pay-per-view event that allows people to watch cons in cars equipped with machine guns, rocket-launchers, napalm, and other goodies try to kill each other for sport. Hennessey wants Ames to drive and wear the mask of a famous and much-loved competitor, Frankenstein, so that her viewer ratings can stay up, and she makes the promise that if Ames wins the race, he can have his freedom. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Ames will become the new Frankenstein and its not long before he is going up against violent and vicious competitors, including three time winner Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). Watching this movie I could just imagine a group of 13-year old boys sitting behind me, each wearing his WWF and Stone-Cold Steve Austin shirts, having a gay old time with it. So much so that I'm surprised the movie actually went for an R-rating. It's incredibly dumb and for the most part un-involving, but going back to the R-rating, it does have some decent carnage. The movie is shot in a dreary blue setting, letting us know that the world is no longer a warm and loving place but a cold, violent and ugly looking cess pool. The story means next to nothing and is mostly a three-stage race that gets increasingly redundant as it goes along. Cars go around in circles really fast, blood, bullets, and explosions ensue, people meet grisly deaths and then everything happens all over again. ""Death Race"" does have a few actual dramatic car duels however, one where Ames goes up against the man that killed his wife and another when he and Machine Gun Joe go up against a tank. The rest is take it or leave it stuff that will interest you only if your really gung-ho about your blood, guts, and souped-up killer cars.Statham is perfect for this type of role though, giving Ames a gruff, hardcore quality that's even more high octane than the cars. And Joan Allen is his perfect antagonist. Icy, manipulative, and devious, she makes Hennessey one of the better villains to come out this summer. Its just too bad she's not apart of a better movie. And like always, Ian McShane is gravel-voiced testosterone. I think that Tyrese Gibson is falling into a pattern here and I hope someone takes him out of it soon. As he showed in ""Baby Boy"", he is a much better actor than being the sidekick in racecar movies.""Death Race"" has some fun and the actors do what they can, but its not so much a movie than an excuse to watch carnage and fast cars. When you see an action movie that's this dumb, you know the summer is pretty much over."

NOOOOO...he continued walking slowly, inside the house, not even looking back to see if somebody was behind, totally forgetting that maybe there's somebody out there:the one who threw something on his windshield. not even bothering to turn down the music, not even calling his friends name NOT WEVEN LOOKING BEHIND HIM OR ANY OTHER DIRECTION OTHER DIRECTION, IS IT HARD TO LOOK AROUND??? DUHHHH..... 4. you would've been saved if you stayed where you are.

The Express             ,DarkVulcan29,,misc,2008,10,"I've seen a lot of movies about beating the odds. But The Express is really a winner compared to all of them.Ernie Davis(Rob Brown, best known from Finding Forrester, and Take The Lead) is one terrific football player, in 1958 coach Ben Schwartzwalder(Dennis Quaid) and soon to be football great Jim Brown(Darrin Dewitt Henson) come to Ernies hometown to recruit him to play for Syracuse University. When Ernie gets there, a lot of racism is shoved in his face on and off the field. But refuses to let that break him. What he will learn from Coach Schwartzwalder that it will take more then talent to be the best. Apparently he did learn and took the team to victory, and the coach learned from Ernie too. And in 1961, Ernie was the first African American to win the Heisman trophy. But sadly his NFL career never went any further. That is a spoiler I will not give away, you'll half to see the movie to find out why.A truly great sports film, when you like a story about beating the odds. Remember Ernie Davis, he refused to let racism stop him, he really beat the odds. And the performances of Rob Brown and Dennis Quaid are quite Oscar worthy. The football scenes where great als"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,asznballa10,0,misc,2008,6,"A movie like step up 2 or almost any dance movie for that matter typically has poor writing/script and nothing beyond decent acting. the whole point of these movies is to take your breath away with dance moves and step up 2 does just that. trust me when i say this, the last scene of the movie is one for our generation, one of the best dance scenes in any movie, creative and different it will shock you. i thought stomp the yard had good dance moves and it did but this movie actually outdid that movie. i normally do not like dance movies, i did not like you got served, one of the worst movies ever made possibly, i did not like step up 1, etc. it starts slow to be honest and in the beginning it's nothing that you or i haven't seen before but everything comes together in the end and its great, the last scene and the dancing is what makes the movie and worth the price of admission."
The Incredible Hulk             ,Nytwolf,0,action,2008,9,"For those that know only of the original comic book Hulk, the TV series Hulk, or the regrettable Ang Lee Hulk, you should know that this new version is a mixture of origins.Without spoiling it, one of the larger ingredients in this new Hulk comes from a Marvel series that is an alternate universe. There are many differences in the Ultimates Universe. In this version, Banner did not get his gamma radiation from exposure during an experimental bomb explosion. I won't spoil it, but you can go to www.marvel.com and look under ""Ultimates"" if you wish to get the gist of it. I can truly say that this version captures a little of everything, so that no matter what your knowledge is of the Hulk character, there's tie-ins to everything.Personally, I felt this reboot was well thought out. It allows for any future connectivity by not limiting it to one version of the Hulk. This will allow future Marvel movie-makers the ability to pick and choose aspects from the multitude of alternate universes, re-tellings, and time spans to combine whatever they please.This was well cast. When the overall product can make me forget the fact that I don't like a specific actor, and truly appreciate the total entertainment experience, it's something to smile about. I won't mention which one I don't care for, since all that will do is spark useless debate.Story - intricate and intelligent, fast-paced, yet deeply explanatory, complex, yet easily taken in by non-geeks. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. I surely was.CGI was great. Don't know why some have to nit-pick, but you can't please everyone, I guess. Action was wonderful with plenty of it! If you've ever read one of my reviews, you'll know that I'm a true fan of overall entertainment. While I have favorites, I don't base reviews on just one actor, writer, director, production company, genre, or whatever. So, if you don't like my opinion, so be it. 3"
Nim's Island             ,NavyOrion,1,adventure,2008,2,"How much of a movie should one see before passing judgment on it? I took my 12-year-old daughter to see this one this afternoon. Twenty minutes in, she started whining ""Da-a-a-a-a-a-d, this su-u-u-u-cks!"" While I did disapprove of her choice of words, I had to agree with her assessment. We gave it another 15 minutes before going back to the cashier and asking for a refund.Considering the talent being used (Jodie Foster and young Abigail Breslin, whose performances I have found winning in the past) I was surprised at the ridiculous presentation of the film. Every scene played out like a dream sequence from some better-done movie, coming off completely contrived and hollow. It was painful to see an actress like Jodie Foster reduced to such rubbish; I can't help but think that has the capacity to have turned in more a believable performance had she wanted to, but frankly this was not deserving of her best work.Perhaps we missed something special in the 55 minutes we skipped, but there was certainly no sign of it on the horizon when we left. Children of 6 years or so may be entranced, but there are better children's films out there; why waste their time (and ruin their developing taste) with junk that no one even tried to make good?"
W.             ,kaddie001,0,misc,2008,8,"I had a chance to see this film on Wednesday and I loved it !!! I'm not a Bush fan or supporter, however what I loved most about it is that it isn't a Bush-hate fest. Rather, it was a successful attempt to show Bush as simply a man with several human foibles, many of which just happen to be hilarious.What makes the movie so amusing is that Stone miraculously finds a way for you to not laugh at Bush the man. Rather, one laughs at the improbability of the entire Bush saga.Against that backdrop is the importance of the fine performances given by the actors.Some actors, like Banks as Laura Bush, give performances that are good but that are altogether too predictable and uninspired.On the other hand, Brolin nails his performance as he turns Bush from a doofus to a poor schmuck that finds out too late that he's in over his head.Newton is the OTHER BRIALLIANT performance in the film. Although, some critics apparently wanted the average TV-Movie-muck type of performance where the actress finds the ""lighter side"" of the real life person, Newton and Stone smartly resist that trite nonsense.Newton transcends her own glamorous persona and gives a hard-as-nails imitation of Rice as a person that is smart enough to understand and follow those that actually have the power in the Bush White House as she helps them manipulate Bush to acquiesce to their desires.Newton's performance successfully evokes images of the Rice that recently went to Russia and had the nerve to coolly and robotically lecture Putin on why it's OK for the U.S. to travel half the globe to punish those who kill Americans, but it's not OK for Russia to go over its border to punish those that kill Russian citizens.It's one of the gutsier performances all year by anyone, male or female, and it really helps make the movie great.As I stated at the beginning W. is great, and we finally get a movie that appeals to those of us that don't want to waste $10 bucks on a film about a Hollywood Chihuahua. 1"

The Dark Knight             ,mdolz1374,0,action,2008,10,"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth. This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight. The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc. No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"

I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films 1"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,nesfilmreviews,0,crime,2013,NA,"Its as if David Lynch has directed a unique, psychological thriller/western that oddly develops on the soggy plains of Copenhagen. ""Terribly Happy"" is a relentless and expressionless film noir, and may be the best pseudo-western that Denmark has ever sent our way. The plot nudges us to laugh at things that aren't funny, except they are, because we're not that hapless schmuck doing precisely the thing he shouldn't do in the exactly the wrong town.The setting is a remote Danish burg that's as bleak and crummy as most of its residents. Robert (Jakob Cedergren) is a Copenhagen police officer who transfers to a small provincial town to fill the position of the mysteriously vacated Marshall. He wants to be the good guy, but the citizens have their own ways of dispensing justice, and besides, there's a skeleton in Robert's closet - he's been in trouble, and his new assignment is a kind of banishment. The townspeople are a gallery of surly grotesques living in fear of the town bully, Jørgen (Kim Bodnia), who habitually beats his wife, Ingelise (Lene Maria Christensen). She shows Robert her bruises and scars, and comes on to him. She wants his help and then doesn't want it - she's one confused woman. We don't know who's telling the truth, and neither does Robert, who is advised to look the other way. Of course, he doesn't. Opportunities for compromise abound. Robert's big city temperament makes it impossible for him to fit in, or what to make of the bizarre behavior displayed by the town's people. As the storyline unfolds, it grows increasingly desperate and darkly comedic. The unease is undisguised, and you, like Robert, will fight it at first, but eventually be forced to accept it and just give in. Director Genz is perfectly paired with cinematographer Jørgen Johansson who captures the essence of trepidation and misery. To call this a dark comedy may be misleading because you won't be laughing out loud, but the humor keeps an unnerving undercurrent. An offbeat modern noir, and an unusually compelling portrait of a town that has its own sense of justic"
The Escapist             ,valleyjohn,,crime,2009,5,"There have been many great prison escape movie in the past. Escape from Alcatraz , The Great Escape and Papillon are just three classics that spring to mind . Sadly The Escapist is nowhere near good enough to mentioned in the same breath as those three. Frank Perry (Brian Cox) is an institutionalized convict twelve years into a life sentence without parole. After years of brutal prison life he begins to feel that there is nothing to live for on the inside. When his estranged daughter falls ill, Frank is determined to make peace with her before it's too late. He develops an ingenious escape plan, and recruits a dysfunctional band of escapists <U+0096> misfits with a mutual dislike for one other but united by their desire to escape their hell hole of an existence. However his dogged fight for freedom is blocked at every turn not just by the guards but also by the local psychotics that roam the prison. But Frank only has the one goal in mind and that's to come to the aid of his daughter<U+0085>by any means necessary. Much of the action takes place within the tunnels, sewers and underground rivers of subterranean London.Despite the impressive cast (Brian Cox , Joseph Fiennes and Damian Lewis) The escapist is a bit of a mess. Foe some reason we see the escape happening in snap shots between the actual planning of the break out and it's totally confusing.I wonder why directors feel the need to mess around with time lines in films?. It's a big risk to show some of the climax of a film before the end and if it fails it ruins the whole film. That's the case with The Escapist.It's a shame because the acting deserves a much better final product . The performances from Brian Cox ( Frank) , Dominic Cooper ( Lacey) and Steven Mackintosh (Tony) are impressive but sadly to no avail.The prison scenes are unrealistic and look almost Victorian and i was extremely surprised when halfway through the film it is disclosed that the prison was in London. I could have sworn it was in Ireland due to the amount of Irish accents. ( This was made by Parallel films an Irish Company).Another thing is that we never find out what the characters did to get into prison in the first place . There is very little background information on the inmates so therefore i didn't care what happened to them .If you have seen or a planning on seeing The Escapist i would like to ask you a favour. Please explain the ending to me! I was left totally bemused as to what was real and what wasn't and in the end i just wanted it to finish , escape or no escape.If you considering watching this do yourself a favour and watch one of the three movies i mentioned at the start of this review instead . You wont regret it. 5 out of 10"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,edwagreen,1,misc,2009,3,"This Sisterhood just attempts too many plots and while it's inter-woven, it becomes downright obnoxious to view.What's with this pants to begin with? Many people out-grow theirs and this is precisely what occurs in this film. One girl loses her mom to suicide, another goes off on an archaeological expedition to basically nowhere, a third finds romance, loses the guy who is lied to, only to recapture him later and the Ugly Betty of television gets acting part by accident in a summer drama session and makes the best of it.The scenes depicting Greece are nice but this is not exactly Mamma Mia!That film had zest and a breath of fresh air with one specific story affecting the lives of others. 'Sisterhood"" is just trying to tell too muc"
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,furex,0,misc,2009,7,"Andreotti was really recognized guilty of association with Mafia until 1980. This was probably the most important piece of information to be delivered to the audience, but it was instead concealed with legalese in a small blurb of rolling text among the end titles, where it's easy to understand just the opposite.There's an unspoken agreement in the Italian medias, for this truth must not really be spoken or printed. We must all go on pretending Andreotti was acquitted of all charges because he was innocent. His lawyer, the one who lost the appeal, went on to lie and everybody in the press and TVs pretended to believe her. Now she's a politician herself. Go figure uh?Paolo Sorrentino, despite trying to be oh-so-courageous, can't manage to state it in a simple and understandable way.The screenplay is in itself a little messy. While in a sense it tries (and succeeds) in conveying the intricacies and complexities of politics through artistic devices, and to point out how blurred is the line which separates the underlying blunt truths from the soft words of the lies which the public must be lullabied into - the final outcome is that even I had some trouble to make all the facts and faces overlap with their real-life counterparts. And that believing I have a fair (though certainly far from complete) understanding of some of the basic facts that underpin the rise and fall of one of Italy's most controversial and powerful figure in all of my country's recent history.I can only wonder what insights the unsuspecting audience may have gained from this viewing. And with the great deal of time the film spends to describe in detail all the quirks that make this otherwise alien figure all so human, eventually the effect may turn out to be sympathy for the devil.The task was certainly not an easy one, but the outcome is a thorough disappointment."
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,ligonlaw,0,adventure,2008,9,"This is a film about three oddly-matched people on a journey. They are strangers to each other, and they are quite strange. The film derives a lot of its early edge from the concern we have for the young girl who is in the company of two potentially dangerous and unstable men. Yellow Handkerchief opens in a cold prison where William Hurt's character says farewell to his fellow inmates. He is tough, hardened, and taciturn, a man well past middle age. As with any convict, you want to know what his crime was. He takes a bus to a small Louisiana town. There, you get a visual suggestion that his crimes may have been sexual, as the camera shows a gathering of young people outside a restaurant. He drinks his first beer at this diner as we eavesdrop on the teens' conversations. We wonder if he is there to find prey or these young people are there by happenstance.Hurt's flashbacks are many and frequent, and they begin in this dining room as he contemplates his first taste of beer in the first afternoon of his freedom.A pretty 15-year-old girl, named Martine, is receiving much attention from two boys her age. Martine is played by 18-year-old Kirsten Stewart, who, in her short life, has appeared in a dozen films and collected half a dozen acting awards. We overhear Martine talking with the more handsome boy. She had been with him the night before, and we hear bits of conversation which sound like the boy may have taken advantage of her. Martine is on her cellphone with her father with whom we learn she has a stormy relationship. He is a thousand miles away on business, and she lies to him about where she is.A goofy-looking boy, named Gordy, seems to be in constant motion. Gordy is smitten by Martine's charms, and he appears to have no chance with her. He says odd things and speaks inappropriately. He is in and out of the dining room as Hurt sips his beer enjoying freedom. The goofy kid wants to buy throw-away cameras with expired dates. He claims he is native American, but he looks Anglo. He is a bit weird. Hurt would later explain Gordy's behavior to Martine: ""He is young for his age."" Gordy is played by Eddy Redmayne, who looks much younger than his 26 years. A fine British actor who appeared in ""The Other Bolyn Girl,"" ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" and ""The Good Shepherd,"" plays a misfit with serious emotional problems in this movie.The goofy-boy, the pretty girl and the ex-con leave this small Louisiana town in Gordy's old convertible. Their destination is uncertain except that they head south. It was bad judgment in the extreme for Martine to go away with the two men. A romantic girl, she is strangely attracted to the ex-con who is three or four times her age. The journey proceeds in serendipitous and unpredictable ways. Along the way, layers of our first impressions peel away as these three reveal much about themselves.Critics have said that American films are about objects like cars, guns, houses, airplanes and ships, while European films are about people and relationships. In this poverty-saturated section of Louisiana, the only thing to see is the human interaction. Tension pulls us into this film because what we know about these characters makes us apprehensive. We are further drawn in by curiosity; we want to find out who these strangers are and why they are together at all. An odd coupling, not one is much like the other. As the drama unfolds, we learn more about each one and find reasons to like and admire them. This is the kind of film that actors crave; they can strut their stuff and show their chops. William Hurt,one of America's finest actors, does not disappoint. The Oscar-winner's fellow travelers are excellent. Maria Bello has a supporting role which comes through Hurt's flashbacks. She plays another quirky, hard woman with a soft core. This film is one of those fine dramas which was a risk for the producers. It was too good not to make, but it is a film that could tank at the box office because it does not feature car chases and gratuitous explosions. This is drama for intelligent people which probably deserves Oscar nominations but it could pass under the radar of film audiences and critics. Each year Hollywood sends us some rare gems that we must look to find. Great films go unnoticed and are unfairly ignored. A short list would include ""Antwone Fisher,"" ""My First Mister,"" ""Life As A House,"" ""What We Lost in the Fire"" and ""Finding Forester"" - all deserving Oscar consideration in several categories, but lost in the shuffle at the end of the season. This might end up on the list of great films you never saw if you don't go see it."

Slumdog Millionaire             ,anhedonia,0,drama,2008,10,"I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.Boyle has taken what is essentially a story about a young man on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and transformed it into a gritty, realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching fairy tale. It's a Dickensian picture about a world rarely, if ever, seen in mainstream movies, a film that grabs us from the opening frame and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.This is why I love movies. Films like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" are rare. They are things of beauty, works of art that make me fall in love with movies all over again. Boyle has done it twice. First with ""Millions"" (2004), which also, coincidentally, was about a young boy and money; and now with ""Slumdog Millionaire."" This is Boyle's masterpiece - a stunningly original piece of film-making.Every once in a while there is a sleeper film, usually an independent movie, that comes along, takes everyone by surprise, then gets terrific word of mouth and becomes a huge success. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (2002), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) - though I did not care much for it - and ""Juno"" (2007) are such films. But, frankly, those films can't hold a candle to ""Slumdog Millionaire.""What might surprise many viewers is that a third of the dialogue is in Hindi. (And Boyle's placement of subtitles on the screen makes such good sense!) Please do not let that dissuade you from seeing this marvelous film. Do not let the R rating prevent you, either. What was the MPAA thinking? Honestly! There are far more offensive, vulgar and violent movies that are rated PG-13. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should never have received an R rating. (This film should be mandatory viewing for young people, especially those in industrialized nations.) Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi, instead, is the right call. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depicts the realism of the kids' lives.That's what incredible about this film. Boyle and Beaufoy do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the grime, sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks of Boyle true ingenuity, he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. There is one moment - and I shan't spoil it for anyone, but you will know it when you see it - that very well might be my favorite film moment in the last five years.Boyle doesn't do a thing wrong here. From his choice of actors to the music to his choice of colors, Boyle works his magic.The performances are uniformly good. Irrfan Khan finds the right balance between a tormentor and a quasi-father figure as the police officer. There's young Dev Patel as Jamal, playing with confidence, bringing a wonderful swagger to his role, as well as a sense of fear that we completely understand. Freida Pinto as the love interest is superb. And, of course, there are the three young 'uns. Perfectly cast, they actually make the film work. Their performances as Jamal, Salim and Latika are so utterly convincing that they completely draw us into the picture and make the jobs of the older actors playing them much easier.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is, I suppose, a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It makes you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius.The film moves along at a breakneck pace, yet none of the cinematic flair - and there is plenty - seems superfluous. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's such a brilliantly kinetic energy to this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.What Boyle has done is truly miraculous. He has turned a film about street life in Bombay into a visceral, genuine crowd-pleaser. And you will walk out of the movie theater feeling inspired and hopeful, knowing you've just seen something very special.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is, without any doubt, one of the ten best films of the decade. 4"
The Lucky Ones             ,ShawnBalint,,adventure,2008,7,"Well this movie could have been so much more. The trailers featured the emotional ""I will remember you"" but the movie, apparently adjusted to growing indifference to the Iraq War by many, was afraid to let you care too much. I was really disappointed to see what happened with this film. I did a little bit of extra work (was cut from the guitar scene at last minute) on this film and it never even showed in Edwardsville, Illinois (near ST. Louis) where ""Denver"" scenes were filmed.I couldn't disagree more about Rachel MacAdams character. As an actress her job is reflect reality and some of the people who turn to the military in rural small town America where often times jobs were hard to come by before the economic meltdown. Someone from Colee's background probably wouldn't talk like someone Harvard bound, coming from a broken home etc. She brilliantly portrayed someone who refused to be held down by the life she was born into, was highly inquisitive, caring, supportive. She was a beautiful person, a great character that Rachel brought life to. She wasn't intelligent, but she wasn't dumb if you can wrap your mind about that. I thought she turned in a tremendous performance that too few people saw. I also bet there were tremendous moments left on the cutting room floor. I really thought many aspects of her performance were Oscar quality.Oh gee and Tim Robbins isn't the first actor to have political views. He's a professional and I didn't see an overwhelming agenda in his role. He seemed to focus on telling a story about what happens to these people when they return home.Michael Pena continues to be an underrated talent.I give the George Lucas stale raspberry award for bad CGI moments to the crew for including a stupid tornado scene that looked like it came from the Buster Keaton era. They did a much better job in '39 with the Wizard of Oz! I wonder if this film will be ""put back together"" with the DVD"
Hancock             ,Brato_Useba,0,action,2008,3,"they say will smith is the last remaining box-office magnet, but it won't stay that way with movies like this. the only good thing about hancock is the idea of a superhero drinking and being rude, but we had that already in superman 3 (or 2, or 4, cant remember). apart from that hancock is average cinema-stuff, a little dull, even boring at times. then they have this surprise in it, which makes you think: wtf, cool! but then it turns out to be completely random. with no real villain and plot holes over plot holes this movie is just not good. wait for the DVD and rent it if you're a will smith fan, for all the rest of you: stay away and go watch the dark knight instead on Friday."
The Burning Plain             ,EUyeshima,1,misc,2009,6,"Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's big-screen collaborations with director Alejandro González Iñárritu have produced a trio of highly accomplished films - ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", and ""Babel""  that juxtaposed several story lines, all tied together by characters who were damaged souls in search of redemption and connection with one another. Although the two had a very public falling-out, Arriaga still appears to be strongly influenced by his former partner's jumbled film-making style as he takes over the director's chair with this 2009 drama. The chief problem, however, is that Arriaga doesn't really show Iñárritu's passion and audacity as he attempts to pull off the considerable demands of a non-linear narrative with conviction. Moreover, Arriaga the screenwriter lets down Arriaga the director with a script that ultimately feels too predictable and contrived despite strong performances from the cast.There looks to be four separate stories at the outset, which eventually transitions into two. The first involves Sylvia, the manager of an upscale, seaside restaurant in Portland, an extremely pained woman who prefers casual sex followed by self-inflicted punishment. She is obviously anguished over something that motivates her erratic behavior. The second thread takes place in New Mexico near the Mexican border where Gina, an unhappily married mother of four, is carrying on an affair with a local man named Nick, also married with children. The complication here is that her daughter Mariana finds out about the affair and embarks on a relationship with Nick's son Santiago. Meanwhile, in Mexico, a crop-duster plane crash-lands on an open field, as his twelve-year-old daughter Maria watches in horror.Arriaga's fractured approach works for a little while albeit in an emotionally draining, humorless way. However, when the moment of revelation arrives (and much too early), the plot unravels into a Lifetime TV-movie level of sanctimony obscured by the fiery explosion that gives the movie its name. Proving yet again that a beautiful woman can convincingly expose the torment of a soul under fire, Charlize Theron successfully makes the nihilistic Sylvia an ultimately sympathetic figure. Kim Basinger, looking entirely too stunning and wrinkle-free at 55 to be a K-Mart-shopping housewife, manages to get to the heart of a guilt-ridden woman, even as she shows Gina going through the predictable machinations of her illicit actions.The stand-out performance, however, comes from Jennifer Lawrence, a Jewel-look-alike, as the troubled teen Mariana, the dramatic pivot for the whole movie. Tessa Ia makes a strong impression as the pensive Maria, while the men barely make a ripple  John Corbett as a smitten sous-chef in Sylvia's restaurant, Joaquim de Almeida as the passionate Nick, José María Yazpik as the go-between Carlos, and Danny Pino as the pilot. The one exception is J.D. Pardo who plays Santiago as the impetuous Romeo to Lawrence's Juliet. Robin Tunney shows up in a smallish role as Sylvia's one true friend. Robert Elswit and John Toll share cinematography responsibilities here, and they do an excellent job capturing all the locales. At the end of the movie, I couldn't help thinking that Arriaga's yin was fundamentally missing Iñárritu's yang"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,dvc5159,0,drama,2009,7,"Brad Pitt makes his mark as an actor here as Benjamin Button, a man with a strange disorder - physically aging backwards. Along his emotional journey of life he encounters friends, family, loved ones, adventures, and most of all, chances.Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it. Truly, David Fincher and Pitt have created a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of its time. Taking a strange and fascinating tale and making it into one of the decade's very best films is something of an accomplishment.Pitt, here, is an actor, not just a pretty face anymore. With the state-of-the-art visual effects at his hand, he pretty much carries the whole show. It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects. You genuinely feel and sympathize for his character, rooting for him all the way. Pitt owns the film, in short. He and David Fincher make a great team, and they look unstoppable to create more terrific films.For the supporting cast, Cate Blanchett plays the love interest of Daisy to great effect. Her tale with Benjamin's make them somewhat star-crossed lovers. I won't go that far into detail but you'll see much later into the film. Taraji P. Henson also shines as Benjamin's surrogate mother, who gives her son the support he needs. Not to mention Tilda Swinton as an early love interest.The screenplay by Eric Roth is excellent. Told from Benjamin's point of view with some highlights by Daisy, there are no clichéd dialogs to be heard, and the script is filled with equal moments of joy, ecstasy, sorrow, and understanding. Some dialog here is timeless and quotable, such as the film's tag-line; ""We are defined by opportunities, even by the ones we miss."" When you age backwards, you get more chances rather than missing it. I love that and wish for it, but sadly that is what movies are made for. And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.David Fincher is a tour-de-force of film-making. Straying away from gritty violent thrillers such as ""Zodiac"", the unmatched ""Fight Club"", and ""Se7en"", he takes a bizarre love story, the most expensive budget he's faced, and crafts a film with such substance and flair that he adds quality to the film. There are moments in the film which make it obvious Fincher is calling the shots. The paced is slow, but this allows us to absorb and be infatuated with the characters. There is not one dull moment in the film. It is constantly gripping and re-watchable.Technically speaking, the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect; gorgeous to the eyes and senses, and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director Fincher's trademark. Accompanying this is the beautiful and heart-wrenching score by Alexandre Desplat, which is absolutely flawless. The special effects are unique and well-made, and you'll find yourself confused to whether certain scenes were made with special effects or not. If you want to see actors when they were young this is the best rendition of effects possible, and I hope the future movies use more of this amazing technology to make their stars more bankable. The special effects deserve their Oscar for it is the best I've seen in any movie in 2008.In short, it is a beautiful, tragic, and terrific movie. It is certainly timeless and will stand the test of time, and hopefully, age well like fine wine (no pun intended). This absolute gem deserves the nominations it gets, too bad it was released the same year as Slumdog Millionaire.Overall rating: 9/10 "
Trucker             ,movieluver3000,1,drama,2008,NA,"""Trucker"" is amazingly...bad. I had no plans to see this film at Tribeca, but when a kind soul 'gifted' me two tickets just prior to the sold-out screening...I could not resist as I am a big fan of Michelle M. (loved her in ""Gone Baby Gone"").Reading the director's comments in the program prior to the film, I suddenly became excited as he was apparently heavily influenced by great 70's films like ""The Last Detail"" and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."" Unfortunately, once the film began...all hope for anything remotely fresh or interesting ceased. What a boat load full of cliché after cliché. Michelle M. with all of her star power, can barely muster the strength to give this turkey any legs.When the film ended, I just sat in my seat and wondered how does this trite...been there done that 100 times over...sad wanna-be ""auteur"" film get made? Michelle's new rom-com opens next weekend with Patrick Dempsey...I have higher hopes for that one."
Kisses             ,kwugboots,1,drama,2009,NA,"I enjoyed this film. I love watching films about the darker sides of human experience, about poverty, about children living through tough times, and films about overcoming, hope, survival & fighting.This was not a sentimental film, which was great. It didn't have a tidy Hollywood ending, it had a realistic ending. The film carried a sense of being just a short glimpse into the lives of these two children, and in that sense the ending of the film didn't seem like a real ending. The film ended with a bit of hope for the future, mostly because the two children (neighbours) knew each others secrets and were going to look out for each other (and also because both children were clearly resourceful & were fighters). The two children were great together, and Dylan really sold the film to me with his quiet, gloomy, blank/hardened & almost hopeless expressions.My main critique of the film is that crazy car-chase bit. That seemed very concocted and not realistic. I don't think that she would have just stood there while the creepy men were asking her questions from their car, she would have moved away from the car to be with Dylan. I also struggled to believe that 2 men would attempt to abduct an 11 year old girl wearing a fluffy pink jacket, who clearly did not look like a street kid - and that they would do so in front of a witness (Dylan) who could describe them, their car, and their numberplate. More realistic would be if someone tried to abduct her if she got separated from Dylan (however, even then, she really does not look like a street kid with no family to miss her).Another critique of the film is that the children rarely look scared or anxious or cautious about trusting an adult. They are on the streets of Dublin by themselves late at night. At 11 years old I would have been terrified to be in their shoes in an unfamiliar (at least at night) place among strangers. Even after she is almost abducted Kylie does not look very scared. She lies down & goes to sleep instantly, and Dylan soon follows - obviously neither are afraid of the kidnappers returning or of other men attacking them (if they were, Dylan would have tried to stay awake). Kylie looked far more afraid after she found the dead man then she looked after she was abducted.I didn't like black woman's reasons for kissing the old man. She said, ""when you kiss, you either give or you take"", but when he kissed her he took something from her, and when she kissed him sexually it wasn't because she wanted to, or because she liked him sexually. She felt felt like she owed him, she wanted to do something for him, so she gave him the only thing she could - sex/kisses - even though she was not attracted to him & even though he was her father's age. I'm disappointed that the director chose this morally questionable scene to be the moral highpoint and moral message of the film. I don't see how the film's message, ""when you kiss, you either give or you take,"" is exemplified by this woman's semi-prostitution.One more small criticism: the fight scene in Dylan's house didn't seem very realistic. I wanted Dylan's dad to be more threatening, intimidating, dominating than he was; I thought it would have looked scarier to the viewers if he had really got in her face, backed her into the wall or loomed over her (like the abusive husband did in the ""Burning Bed"" film). There should have been a film shot of Dylan's face looking worried/indecisive about how to act before he lunged at his father. Also, his father should have been still attacking the mother at the time Dylan attacked.The acting & the directing is not amazing, but for the most part I was really captivated by Dylan's performance, by the children's friendship, and by the basic storyline. There are few films about children, particularly about children from tough environments/abuse/poverty, particularly about street children or children surviving on their own. There should be more films about children like this one"
The Brothers Bloom             ,gratwicker,1,action,2009,1,"I'dreally like to give this zero stars. Or less. One of the most frustrating movies I have ever sat through. This film was awful. My granddaughter thought it was about little children because of the children in the beginning of the film, and the contrived ""artful"" dialog and camera work. Motivation is non-existent. The characters find lots of stage business to do on camera. Quirky music abounds. There is even a three legged cat that is supposed to get laughs. I like bright colors in color films and they are bright in this one. There are some things to look at. The grass is very green and the sky perfectly blue. If there are clouds in the heavens you can be sure that they will be cotton-puffy and very white. The con artists play cons on each other. But there is a subplot.An older brother has a lesson for the younger brother. He's been writing his brother's life since they were little. He wants his little brother to write his own life. So he tricks him. And then tricks him again. This is not the Socratic Method. The writer-director thinks that Spelling Ryan ""Rian"" is creative. That's the level of creativity that this movie aspires to.There's an Asian character who has no place in the move, but then none of the charactoers have any place in the movie. The actors must have been conned into playing in this movie"
Mamma Mia!             ,alrodbel,1,comedy,2008,1,"I love musicals, all of them, from joyous Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic ""Damn Yankees."" And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.In a ""real"" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. So, in Guys and Dolls, ""My Time of Day"" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.For this lover of the Broadway Musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century Musicals. They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in ""Sweet Charity.""Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps, another day, another mood, I could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.But I can't help but imagining what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and I can not help but to mourn the great loss. "
What Happens in Vegas             ,DICK STEEL,1,comedy,2008,6,"My only trip to the US (not counting the toddler days) where I can remember what the heck I was doing, was back in December 2005 (gee, time flies!) where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts, and seriously, it's never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies (or that television series), though you'd truly never really run out of things to do, despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!And of course, Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators, live entertainment etc, is the ability to conduct quicky marriages, which is what Ashton Kutcher's Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz's Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares, two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives, where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer, before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.So begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember, but cannot do so when McNally's quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller, and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can't agree how to split the money, and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months ""hard marriage"" to work through their marital vows, before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out, it's War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couch-therapy sessions by Queen Latifah, with comedy ranging from the slapstick, to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.Attempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth, come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy, non-committal ways, and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down, lighten up, and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes, in true ""live your dream"" fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix, you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale, where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.I thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves, i.e. one's dating an older woman, the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well, at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages, but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles, Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets, and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie, since she has on display, really menacing looking biceps, and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.Kutcher on the other hand is, well, Kutcher from Punk'd, with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead, the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater, Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies, as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.At best, What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic- comedy from the factories of Hollywood, or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer.

Pathology             ,johnnycandle,1,crime,2008,3,"I like tasteless movies, sexy movies, twisted horror movies and I also liked Crank, which was penned by the writers of Pathology. So, I was looking forward to this one.If you imagine the Lost Boys, crossed with CSI, Saw, throw in some Cronebourg type sex and that should give you some idea of the concept behind Pathology. Sound good doesn't it? Now imagine a team of brilliant young doctors who are also serial thrill-killers who go into a psycho-sexual frenzy when performing post mortems on their colleagues victims. Not terribly plausible you may think.Now can you imagine an even more brilliant young doctor joining the hospital, he's arrogant, he's the top guy from Harvard, he's loaded, and within minutes he's a serial thrill-killer who goes into a psycho-sexual frenzy when performing post mortems on his colleagues victims. Having trouble? Incredibly, it's even more ridiculous than it sounds. But completely unbelievable is not completely unforgivable.My real moan is that no one is likable, and there is clearly no attempt to make anyone remotely sympathetic. So the reasoning behind purpose this can only be for the gore and the kinky sex. This would make it an exploitation movie, which I normally love.So what's the problem? Well, it's the ""level of unlike-ability"". Everyone is so detestable, that it goes beyond the type of movie where you're waiting patiently for characters to be get naked or be bumped off. Here they take you deep into the realm of the really bloody irritating. Everything about them makes you hate them so much that their faces become more and more punchable as the minutes crawl by. Their witless babbling and pseudo-philosophy grates on you so much that their frenzied pervy couplings just make you glad they've shut up for a minute.Borders on unwatchable."
The House Bunny             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,comedy,2008,6,"Ever since I saw the trailer for The House Bunny back in May, I was looking forward to seeing it, this looked like a fun comedy and we all love Anna Faris, this girl is just adorable, and she makes comedies a lot of fun. So I saw The House Bunny yesterday and I did enjoy myself, but we've done this before, the dumb blonde story, not that we can't do it again, I'm just looking for something a little fresh. But Anna Faris holds herself so well with comedies, The House Bunny, she doesn't seem to enjoy herself as much in this role. A lot of the moments where she acts stupid, she looks a little uncomfortable at times, I think that's why this movie didn't stand out as well as other dumb blonde comedies. But it's mindless entertainment, the message, it worries me a little, I'll explain why in a little bit, but I'd say if you're a grown up and you know better, than this is a fun little movie.Shelley is a hot playboy bunny whose life is just grand, she's a sweetheart, a little on the slow side, but always has good intentions, and when it appears that Hugh Hefner wants her out of the house due to her age of 27, she must pack up her things and take off. She's homeless, but finds a local sorority that needs a house mother and a clue into a social life. She becomes their house mother and teaches them how to attract people, but she learns a little something too when she meets a sweet, smart, and sensitive guy, Oliver. Now things become a success with the sorority, but they become a little too shallow and Oliver wants more than a playboy bunny, he wants a girl to talk too, and to top that off the other sororities are upset to learn that the former losers are now hotties that everyone loves.My one problem with this movie, even though it is enjoyable, the message isn't appropriate for young girls. I know it's just a movie, I don't want to nit pick, believe me, I know when a movie is harmless, but it's teaching young girls that you have to play yourself down to get a guy and that looks will get you everywhere at any time, also we are rooting for a person who just always has good intentions, why? That's all Shelley is, just a nice person, but she doesn't have many likable qualities. I liked the movie over all, I just think the script needed more work, nothing about this movie stood out, it's a disappointment to me. I would recommend it for silly fun, but otherwise, just wait for the rental.6/10"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,Ramascreen,0,animation,2008,8,"Rarely have I seen animated family sequel movie that's as good or better than its predecessor but speaking as a movie freak who didn't like the first installment, I gotta say I'm very much entertained by MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa and it way funnier than the original movie. Dreamworks has a habit of doing this<U+0085> what it lacks in its story and overall animation (Pixar still rules in those departments!) it makes up for it in its sense of humor. This is the movie that every age can enjoy and it has only a very, very few silly, lame moments but for the most part, you just got to move it, move it! The whole team is back, it doesn't take long for you to remember what each character is all about, there's no need for re-introduction but there is a bunch of new characters thrown in to the den without having to take us in unnecessary complication of having to understand what they are. The concept is simple and the jokes are funny. Here you see all the characters stranded in Africa and meet a their own kind. It's the freedom they've always wanted but don't really want at the same time. They have trouble fitting in and getting in touch with their heritage, all the while friendship and feelings are being put to the test resulting in an exciting adventure at the end that brings them closer together again. Kids will love it, Parents will be glad about it, and the rest of us will find it to be very amusing.MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa will feel like too short of a movie, but that's also something that I can appreciate because I don't think it has any intention of trying to be all Oscar worthy, it's nothing more than telling a light, enjoyable story with good moral value lesson and that's about it. If the running time were any longer, it would lose some of its target audience. Hands down, without dragging this review any more than it has to, the best part of this movie once again, are the penguins! Those dudes are hardcore gangsters and freakin' hilarious! They should have their own spin-off, stand-alone movie, just about them scheming something deviant and mission impossible-esquire. I could watch them work together and hear their smartass, cocky remarks/attitude about a thousand more times and they'll still crack me up. If you find no reason to watch this movie, then at least watch it to check out those awesome penguins. 1"
Frozen River             ,Benedict_Cumberbatch,1,crime,2008,NA,"Courtney Hunt's début feature, ""Frozen River"", winner of this year's Sundance's Grand Jury Prize, is as tense as a great thriller should be, and also a heartfelt, poignant drama.Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) was just abandoned by her druggie husband, having to take care of their two kids and pay for their house alone (otherwise, they'll be evicted). With her minimum wage job at a local store, Ray can't make enough money, but chance will introduce her to a young Mohawk, Lila (Misty Upham), who smuggles illegal immigrants across the frozen St. Lawrence River (between New York State and Québec), and both will be forced to risk a lot in order to get the money they need.Hunt's writing/directing is secure and reveals a very promising talent, but the film's major strength is the extraordinary performances of the lead actresses, in particular Melissa Leo (""21 Grams"", ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada""), magnificent character actress turned lead. Totally deglamourized, her screen presence is real, visceral, almost organic. A flawless performance in a great film, that is at once sad, suspenseful and hopeful. It's not every movie that makes you feel for and really care for its characters, but ""Frozen River"" is one of those rare gems. 10/10."
Stop-Loss             ,mjpetrario,0,drama,2013,2,"The main problem I have with this film and many others at that, is the lack of research and/or military advisor's. It is almost as if the writers, producers, etc guessed the entire time during the making of it. Hollywood as a whole rarely, if ever, gets military uniforms right or close to it so I can't complain about that. Also in the film, we have chaotic firefights that include insane amounts of RPG's blowing things up at point blank range and the first .50 caliber machine gun ever that can't shoot through anything...at all. ""Stop-Loss"" also continues the Hollywood tradition of reloading a weapon once or twice, if ever. Stop-Loss in real life was/is much more common in active duty soldiers than it is National Guard. So I'm also left kind of confused as to why they used the NG plot. The storyline is pretty boring, there is an overage of cheesy military slang that nobody has used since the late 80's/early 90's. All military flaws aside, I personally flat out don't like this movie as a whole. It's right down there at the bottom of the barrel with ""Home of the Brave"" with 50 Cent and Samuel L. Jackson, and ""Hurt Locker"", (where apparently there's no rules for an EOD guy and he's a Ranger?). I believe that the personnel involved in the writing, producing, directing of this film, Stop-Loss had the best intentions to shed light on the epidemic that is Stop-Loss. However, this film is a travesty to anyone who, like myself, has experienced the Stop-Loss policy during OIF and OEF. Kimberly Pierce, Mark Richards, Greg Goodman, and Scott Rudin should ""Stop"" making stupid cheesy movies before they take another box office ""Loss"
Nights in Rodanthe             ,jme_boyce,1,drama,2008,4,"If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like I was. The book was great and I was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well, however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. The book was true love story and I think this movie could of been a lot better."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,neil-476,0,animation,2009,8,"The trailer, which offers the story of a mouse who refuses to be scared, sells this movie short. It covers about 10 minutes of the film, and comes about 25 minutes in. There is an awful lot more story, much of which concerns a good rat, an annual soup festival, an unfortunate death, a pig farmer's daughter, a lonely princess, etc. etc. etc. There are a lot of subplots here, and they all tie beautifully together by the end.Having seen most of the CGI movies pitched at youngsters over the last 12 months, this is one of the better ones. They all seem to take a great deal of care over production and character design, and this is no different - the action takes place in a stylised mediaeval town and castle, and the characters are all well-realised (there's not so much by way of each individual hair being animated, but characters are constructed so as to take that into account as a design element).The voice talent is high profile (Matthew Broderick, Dustin Hoffman, William H Macy, Kevin Kline etc.), varied and, of course, extremely good at what they do. The animation is excellent and there are a number of exciting action set pieces. The film is attractive without being beautiful (as, for instance, parts of Madagascar 2 were). It is perhaps a little intense in places for smaller children, but the story is likely to satisfy older children and adults.Not a major movie in the scheme of things, but a decent enough offerin"
What Happens in Vegas             ,C-Younkin,1,comedy,2008,4,"""What Happens in Vegas"" reminds me of that great ""Seinfeld"" episode; the one where Jerry and George create a sitcom pilot about a traffic accident that results in the guy without insurance being the butler of the other man. It's the idiot plot, a concept that ""Vegas"" indulges in like a free buffet dinner. The movie proves that what happens in Vegas should sometimes just stay on the cutting room floor. The movie stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher as Joy and Jack. Joy got dumped by her boyfriend while Jack just got fired from his job. Both needing a pick-me-up, they are convinced by their friends (Rob Corddry, Lake Bell) to take a trip to Vegas, and after one wild and drunken night, the two wake up in the morning to find each other lying in holy matrimony. Not only that, but while trying to end the marriage, Jack wins a huge jackpot after playing Joy's quarter, throwing a wrench into the divorce proceedings. Whoever gets the other to divorce them first is entitled to the money, and so the ""happy"" couple move in with one another and hatch escalating schemes in order get the other to bail out of the marriage first. Only if you've seen this kind of thing before, what do you think happens when they come back from Vegas? It's a contrived sitcom from the start. Even before I went in I knew what I was getting myself into. Still, if the movie was funny it would more than make up for the complete lack of anything new. I was surprised with the kinetic and wild energy that director Tom Vaughan brings to the opening Vegas scenes, as it almost made me think that this movie may actually be likable. But then these two idiots wake up married and the movie slows to a halt. They each find one witless and unfunny way after another to get on the other's nerves. Joy hogs the bathroom, Jack pees in the sink, Jack rubs his balls then handles food, Joy throws food at him. At one point Jack gives himself a black eye to show that Joy is abusive. The movie wouldn't dare do it the other way around because, of course, spousal abuse on a wife isn't nearly as hilarious. I don't know what's more insulting, that the movie finds this crap funny or that in the last half it expects us to buy this phony romance based on life lessons and profound understanding. And then you have Kutcher and Diaz, two likable actors forced to play with bottom of the barrel material. Kutcher seems to know the material is terrible and tries to be comedic in his own way but the effort turns out to be more obnoxious and over-wrought instead. And Diaz is just shrill and unpleasant. We don't buy it when these two turn from being incredibly mean and nasty to one another to actually understanding the other and so the romance just flounders. On the upside, Rob Corddry is in the movie and he is fastly becoming comedy's best supporting player. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is just dumb. I expected nothing less, was hoping to be surprised with more, but am completely un-surprised by what I got. Sometimes you just have to roll the dice and see what happens though. Snake eyes!"
The House Bunny             ,MiamiHEATfan777,1,comedy,2008,5,"Having also seen the ultra-violent Death Race in the same week as The House Bunny I realized one big thing; clichéd violence doesn't offer any kind of real reaction whereas clichéd humor can still manage to make you laugh as long as the delivery is entertaining and fresh. Sure, the dumb blond jokes in The House Bunny are old and played out, but Anna Faris gives you continuing reason to laugh in a film that is far funnier than it really deserves to be. The House Bunny plays on the sexy-but-dumb stereotype to the fullest extent and Faris has proved in the past, as a regular in the otherwise awful Scary Movie films, she can pull this off. On top of looking amazing, Faris gives this film every reason to exist. Co-stars Emma Stone, Kat Dennings and the increasingly emaciated Rumer Willis offer up a couple of additional laughs, but it is Faris that leads the charge. She plays right up to the edge of the dumb blond stereotype and only occasionally tosses in one too many clichéd jokes. Nevertheless, you forgive her thanks to a consistent number of chuckles throughout the film. This isn't to say this is a classic comedy by any means, but anyone that goes to see House Bunny should walk away with a smile. This isn't a film to hate, it offers up exactly what the trailers promise and it delivers a little extra with an unexpected f-bomb dropped in the mix and a peek at Faris's little bum to keep the men paying attention. Perhaps the one major shock would be Colin Hanks; it seems those Tom Hanks genes aren't quite paying off just yet. After a decent sized role in Peter Jackson's King Kong, Hanks has only managed to worm his way into mediocre films at best. Then again, he hasn't shown anyone any reason to give him anything with more meat on it so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Katherine McPhee of ""American Idol"" fame plays a small role in the feature as does Beverly D'Angelo, but both are relatively inconsequential. The ladies in the audience are more likely to get a kick out of The House Bunny and the fellas dragged to the theater with them should be able to enjoy themselves as well despite the estrogen oozing of the screen. It isn't like this is a film you should rush out to the theater to see, but you could definitely do worse in your selection."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,alexkolokotronis,0,drama,2009,9,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a near epic film in almost the same way Forrest Gump was. I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work. Yet I strongly admired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.The acting was very good throughout the movie. Especially that of Cate Blanchett who seems to be turning out one great performance after another. She plays the role of Daisy, Benjamin Button's real love interest from start to finish. In fact she played so well it might have been a partial downfall to the movie. Her performance out shined that of the main character, played by Brad Pitt. Although Pitt was very solid in his performance I do not believe he deserved an Oscar nomination (rather Blanchett deserved one) for his role of playing Benjamin Button. He was not a necessity to the movie and did not add much to it. He was not bad but he wasn't spectacular. Throughout though many of the different actors and actresses lit up the screen. Especially Tilda Swinton who was wonderful to watch as Button's short lived love interest. Her presence was magical and a joy to watch. I would have loved to see just a little bit more of her character.The directing of David Fincher in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was of what I believe to be his best work to date. The screenplay of Eric Roth was written very well as he has had experience with these type of movies. In many scenes the dialog and great direction combined for some epic scenes.Ultimately I enjoyed this movie very much but something felt missing from the movie. Something seemed left unsaid that was vital. I felt that the great downfall to this movie was that Brad Pitt didn't give an amazing performance and did not take control of the movie rather Blanchett stole the show from him which made Button seem less important to me. Despite that though it this film was done very well and I would recommend it to all. Its an important story that makes us self reflect and think deeply. It displays how we need to live with our mistakes because they are part of our life. We need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder ""what if...?"". "
Street Kings             ,lopcar1993,,misc,2009,7,"Sometimes in Cinema we see things that get repeated over and over and over again so many times that when something new and fresh comes along, we turn the other cheek because we instantly think that it's going to be the same thing done over.. again. But that's not the case with Street Kings. No Street kings is fresh and exciting and puts a whole new spin on the corrupt cop story that makes this film one of the best crime thrillers to come out since The Departed and Goodfelleas, this film follows a winding and snakish path down one back alley of corruption after another. I wouldn't exactly call it original or anything groundbreaking but this film had a great story to tell and in the short time it had it told it well.Keanu Reeves(In his finest hour.) plays corrupt veteran vice detective Tom Ludlow, Ludlow isn't corrupt to further his own career, no Ludlow does it so he can put the criminals where they belong. Which in m book makes that pretty good reason. See the film tries to tell us that one man out of a whole unit is righteous and as the story unfolds in front of you it seems very true that Ludlow is the only good hearted corrupt cop in that unit.I liked this film, I liked the premise and I loved the plot but the one thing that I didn't like was the fact that the whole movie was only 1hr. 47min. long, that was the only let down about the whole film. But besides it all this film delivers an entrancing and very entertaining thrill ride you've just got to see to believe.Street Kings is near-perfect in almost every way imaginable the story is bullet-proof, the acting is very good it's not great but it's very good. The premise is great and everything in the film works amazingly and it's story is told with lightning fast accuracy ad great pacing that let's the story unfold before you piece by piece and then in the end it blows you away.All in all Street Kings is a force to be reckoned with and it's a film that should be given a chance because you never know, you might actually like i"
Pathology             ,darinblack,1,crime,2008,7,"I just saw this movie last night as a preview/focus group in El Segundo. I thought it was interesting, a little predictable. Lots of gore during the morgue scenes, open chest cavities, brains being taken out of skulls etc. Lots of sex scenes and drug usage. A new resident joins a hospital of other residents. They play a game killing people and try to figure out how the person was killed. The kill people they feel are just ""bad"" people. Their egos and attitudes inflate their heads and they think they are now gods. I started to wonder if what they did to the corpses really does happen in morgues? The main character gets in too deep from the start and has to figure a way out of this murderous plot. I liked the way it ended up. Acting and effects were good. Alyssa looks hot as usual. 1"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,Crimsnqt,0,adventure,2010,10,"The Story - Three strangers with seemingly little in common, meet by chance in a little town in Louisiana. Unbeknownst to either of them, their journey through past and present will begin to weave a fabric that gives way to the realization that all are very similar in their need for love and belonging. As Martine (Kristen Stewart), Gordy (Eddy Redmayne), and Brett (William Hurt) set out on an unplanned road trip through Louisiana in order to scatter their individual demons along the way, the unexpected happens. They get to know one another through reflection and observation, and Brett's deep dark past life with May (Maria Bello) begins to surface and spill over into the present. As a result, the scarred and rough layers of these three characters begin to peel away like sandstones washed in the ocean. What we are left with is three individuals who were worlds apart on the surface and through circumstance and chance realize that they are not really that different. So they band together in order to face their pasts head on and pick up the pieces of their broken lives. The Performances - Kristen Stewart plays Martine, a whimsical teenager who clearly has both judgment and abandonment issues due to her less than present father. Kristen, Oh that lovely face, pulls you in from the first sighting! You immediately long to know Martine's story, what brought her to this moment and she has not even said a word! It's all in her facial expressions and body language. Sure anyone could play a 15 year-old with issues, but the difference is Kristen makes you believe in Martine. You or I could know this girl! We could be this girl. Kristen breathed life into an otherwise less than noteworthy character! (The mark of a good actress)! Somewhere I read that her accent was poor in the film! Well there are many accents that arise out of Louisiana and believe me every parish accent is different - honestly you can't even understand some because the accent is so strong, so I thought she did a fair job with it. Eddy Redmayne (Gordy) is very convincing as an awkward young man whose mind has not caught up with his age. I read somewhere that his role is slightly reminiscent of Forest Gump and I would have to agree. His motto: ""Live!""William Hurt (Brett), well what can I say, he delivers as usual. His humble demeanor and genuine care for these two young people satisfies the part of him that longs for what he has lost and at the same time provides both Martine and Gordy's character with a present parental figure that they both desperately cleve to. But there is a dark side to his character and William plays them both well.Maria Bello (May) is a mere memory throughout the film. But don't be fooled! Maria's performance keeps her at the forefront of your psyche.My only qualms with the movie are that I wish the writers/directors would have taken the time to delve deeper into the characters of Martine and Gordy! I believe their characters deserved that courtesy! I will leave it at that to avoid spoiling the movie particulars any further. In addition, I would have liked to see Brett's climatic reveal be a little less forced! It was shoved down our throats and left us hanging<U+0085> *Gasp* I needed more details! (I'm a details girl) JBottom line, I loved this film! Every emotional cord that could have been struck was: Happiness, sadness, anger, triumph, hope, discovery, and new beginnings! A must see"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,skroehr,1,drama,2008,9,"These are cynical times, and the U.S. is still struggling with it's feelings on race, even today. The more of these types of movies, the better. Simple human love comes through in every frame. After a summer of superheroes and sex humor comedies, this was the most life affirming and refreshing film I've seen so far this year. If the academy doesn't recognize some folks from this film, they'd be remiss. I smell Oscar all over this film. Queen Latifah was wonderful as usual. Sophie Okonedo played an emotionally damaged woman with perfect pitch and demeanor. Paul Bettany's performance of the alternately hurt and hurtful father was a challenge. You needed to both hate him, and sympathize with him for the role to be effective, and I thought he pulled this off well. Just simply a moving story, a great script, top notch acting, and all beautifully shot. I place it in the must see category."
Pride and Glory             ,nyshrink,,crime,2008,8,"I haven't seen a lot of cop movies, so perhaps that's why I didn't find this picture ""formulaic"" as some have called it. I did find aspects of the film familiar, but for a different reason: I have been a resident of New York City for some time now; I have known law enforcement officers, and I think this was a realistic movie (except for the large number of murders, but hey, it's a movie). Many scenes of this film were quite reminiscent to me of stories I heard from a (former) corrupt cop I used to know.I appreciated the fact this film showed the characters as human beings with families. I am tired of films that show both heroes and villains without back stories. I'm sure there are younger film-goers who would have preferred a more comic-book like movie...you'll grow out of that.I liked the way the film ended. It brought in another dimension to the human drama.Overall, this film is gripping, well acted, well directed and has an integrity to it that is often missing in films these days."

Working at the Yankee Dollar. On the icy brink of the unforgiving upstate New York wilderness. Living in a trailer. The best thing she can even think of is a bigger trailer. Bottles on bottles of bubble bath she may never open hold the promise of better days that may never break. That's how bad it is. Along comes Lila. In many ways, she has it even worse than Ray: living in an even tinier trailer, estranged from her family, bad eyes, out of work. But she is also a small-time player in the well-oiled trafficking industry, bringing aliens into the US from Canada. Desperate for a little extra cash to buy that bigger trailer, Ray gets involved. At first sight, writer-director Courtney Hunt's debut is as depressing as they come. But beneath rough surfaces, there is also hope. In fact, the many acts of love and kindness are all the more surprising given how hard life is on these people. Just when you think they hit rock bottom, a bona fide miracle comes their way. Says Lila: ""That wasn't me. That was the hand of the creator."" It may be a broken Halleluja, but it's a Halleluja all the same. - Fine performances all around.

Goodbye Solo             ,rooprect,0,drama,2014,9,"Two men are in a taxicab. The passenger is a scowling, angry, misanthropic old man. The cabbie is a smiling, exuberant African immigrant. In a few lines of dialogue we learn that the misanthrope wants to be taken to Blowing Rock, North Carolina on the 20th of the month. ""Why?"" jokes the cabbie, ""You gonna jump off?"" No reply. The cabbie's glowing smile disappears.The poetry of that opening scene is only rivaled by its ability to set a powerful air of suspense that carries through the entire 91-minute film all the way until the last minute. And even though there aren't any flashy car chases, shootouts, steamy sex scenes or fantastical plot twists, ""Goodbye Solo"" grabs your full attention from start to finish.The theme, beautifully set in the opening scene & fleshed out as the story progresses, centers around the duality of the American dream and the American nightmare. The cabbie, relatively new to the USA, loves life and the endless opportunities life presents. He has a job and a family, neither of which are perfect, but they make him happy nonetheless. And he genuinely loves people. The old man is bitter, alone, presumably due to a tragic family meltdown, and he just wants to be left alone. Just as the cabbie is exploring new opportunities, the old man spends his days tying up loose ends: selling his home, closing out his bank accounts, etc. Over the course of 2 weeks or so, we witness the interaction--the philosophical struggle--between these two men, and the suspense of the outcome is maintained until the film's final scene.The acting is absolutely 1st class with both men, particularly by the main character ""Solo"" played by Souléymane Sy Savane in his feature debut. His way of portraying raw optimism and hope is truly worthy of the description Roger Ebert used: ""a force of nature"". At the same time, it's not over-the-top unbelievable like Pollyanna or some children's fantasy character. He plays an intelligent man fully aware of the struggles in life, yet he has faith in his own determination. And isn't that the key to happiness for all of us? The old man character is the antithesis and equally believable. If you've ever suffered a horrible tragedy you know that sometimes nothing can cut through. Nothing. And that's what we see here: a man so resolute in his cynicism that you'd give up on him in 10 seconds.And so, we see the cinematic version of the age-old physics puzzle: what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?The movie takes a quiet, measured pace with plenty of room to breathe. There are gorgeous shots of nature as well as equally haunting views of an empty downtown Winston-Salem at night. Funny, I've driven through that city scores of times on I-95 without giving it a second thought. But next time I think I'll take a small detour and visit. I also need to see this place called Blowing Rock to find out if it's real. The view from up there looks like something Count Dracula would see looking out over the misty mountains of Transylvania.There aren't many popular films to compare this to, but I'd say if you liked the British film ""Happy Go-Lucky"" or the indie film ""This Is Martin Bonner"" or the Japanese ""Shiki-Jitsu"" (Ritual) or even Kurosawa's cinematic masterpiece ""Ikiru"" (To Live), then don't hesitate to see ""Goodbye Solo"

Social niceties annoy him and ""just being friendly"" is out of the question. But this doesn't prevent annoying chatter from following him to his dental practice or even to the hospital where he must undergo his first colonoscopy. While the doctors roll him down a corridor on a gurney, chatting about frivolous nonsense, he interrupts and insists on full anesthesia for the examination.The Problem: Once back on the street, he realizes he can see people that others cannot. He returns to the hospital and asks the doctor if anything unusual happened during the procedure. The doctor's reticence does not deter him from wrenching the truth from her that, technically speaking, he was dead for ""almost 7 minutes"". As a result, he can now see ghosts. And of course, they all want something from him.The ""something"" that one particular ghost, Frank (Greg Kinnear), wants is for him to intervene in the romance of Frank's widow. At first reluctant to take on the task, he finally is blackmailed into to trying to break up her relationship and soon, he begins to enjoy the challenge.The film rises above the hackneyed ""invisible man"" jokes and plays out as a fresh comedy romance. Not fresh on plot, admittedly, but on Gervais' style. True, it's the same character he always plays, but seeing it long-form and with the love interest,it's satisfying. The romance in the plot calls for a performance that offers more than a tortured look or a snarky comment - and Gervais delivers.There are no weepy ""But I love you"" scenes. There are touching moments, however, that are more akin to ""classic"" Hollywood, rather than the big-budget, ruin-the-characters, 4th-installment, CGI festivals that are the hallmark of Tinseltown these days. Worth seeing. Our packed-house audience laughed out loud and applauded the ending. 1"
The Ruins             ,siderite,,adventure,2009,8,"Usually, in a horror, you have the group of hopeless people running around from a monster, or at least one type of monster. Here, you get to be killed by plants, people and even the women in your group. In my opinion, the women easily took top spot.Anyway, the film has a Serge Brussolo feel to it. I have been waiting for movies after his books since forever. This is the closest yet. That doesn't mean it doesn't have its flaws, mainly the victims who almost made me hope for their early death.Bottom line: almost of the same caliber as The Descent, but a bit more psychological than that, without being any less disturbing. Certainly worth a watch. And if there is any sequel, maybe set in a town this time, I would like to see it"
Adoration             ,bob998,0,drama,2009,7,"When I saw The Sweet Hereafter years ago, I thought Atom Egoyan was one of the greatest directors alive, and the subsequent films haven't really shaken that belief. If Adoration is not up to the standard of his best work, it is still well worth seeing. The story is one of terrible loss and forgiveness, and the acting is superb. We are connecting the dots--from racist grandfather to despairing mother to an orphan teenager (played by the excellent Devon Bostick) with big issues around truth and responsibility. The boy's uncle has a lot of issues himself; we can see that being a tow-truck driver is gnawing at his soul (made me think of Repo Man). Scott Speedman as the uncle is really good, he's hiding behind a beard, giving curt responses to Arsinée Khanjian's questions.A problem: lots of use of internet chat rooms to flesh out the story; disembodied, undramatic characters for Simon to interact with (watch for the great Maury Chaykin to heat things up somewhat). Technology is not a launching pad for art, it's just information retrieval or anger management."
The Dark Knight             ,miscellaneous411,0,action,2008,10,"The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again."
Untraceable             ,the_japanese_guy,1,crime,2008,4,"The trailer made this film look gripping and fantastic. But it ended up being rather disappointing.The film had, at times, a sluggish plot development. The actors put on a fairly good performance (Diane Lane in particular). But there wasn't much else.The slow rising action gave way to a moderately tense climax, which did not compensate for an abrupt and disappointing resolution (or lack thereof). It's hard to completely wreck a resolution after a climax, but in my opinion, that was successfully achieved here.In any case, my advice is to just watch the trailer...over and over again. It's a lot cheaper that way, it saves you the disappointment, and maintains a lil more suspense."
The Square             ,oneguyrambling,0,crime,2011,NA,"The action in The Square takes place in a small Australian town, a town so small that everyone knows everyone at least casually, and when a party is arranged most of the residents are invited.Two of these residents are middle aged construction foreman Ray (David Roberts) and a hairdresser in her early 20s named Carla (Claire van der Boom  an awesome stripper name if there ever was one!). Ray and Carla are married<U+0085> but not to each other.Things start going wrong early, but on a smaller scale. Ray and Carla intend to leave their respective spouses and skip town, but first they need cash. To come up with the cash they each come up with a plan, Ray cuts a side deal with a shonky contractor, and Carla's plan involves theft and just a pinch of arson.""It's not like anyone will get hurt"", she reasons. How wrong she is.The Square is as dark as films come, everyone in the film is varying degrees of shonky otherwise they don't get any lines. No room for the honest here Mate. But this is a decidedly non-Hollywood noir, the protagonists aren't gangsters or hit men or criminal geniuses, they are tow-truck drivers, hairdressers and local slobs.As the ever growing bodycount envelops both the innocent and the not so<U+0085> more and more are intertwined in an ever more complex story that should have begun and ended with Ray and Carla skipping town. Alas once the paranoia, mistrust and guilt leads to cover up, murder and betrayal no-one in The Square is destined for a happy ending.As a viewer I kept thinking ""Now how are you gonna get out of this?"" and ""Don't do that you dickhead"", but the actions of those involved never stray into cartoon or the illogical  at least to them. It might take a leap of faith to pretend all the events in the film happen over a short time frame, but it isn't beyond the stretch of the imagination to think most of this stuff could happen.I just hope it never happens near me.Final Rating  6 / 10. An effective and intricately drawn drama that will keep you guessing and involved until the very end, even once you realise there cannot possibly be a happy outcom"
Flash of Genius             ,toniintc,0,misc,2008,7,"Saw the very first showing of this tonight at the Traverse City Film Festival. It was a good movie and Greg Kinnear was very good. The film felt too restricted and hyper focused on the primary movie subject, Bob Kearns. It could have been made better by infusing a bit of side-story from the conflicting characters points of view. Bob Kearns low point in the movie also seemed to happen abruptly with no run-in to the plot twist, so much so that I felt like I missed something. Lauren Graham offered a fine performance, as did Dermot Mulroney's limited screen time. Overall I liked the movie but felt more could have been done to fill some gaps."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,britt46,0,misc,2008,8,"You guys over analyze...sit back and enjoy a great movie. I guess you have to have a passion for dancing to enjoy it but if you don't then just don't ruin it for anyone else. We don't sit here and make fun of your little horsey movies or little car movies, everyone has their own likes and dislikes and if you enjoy dancing you will enjoy the movie. The actors/actresses are portrayed as very skilled dancers in this movie and you eyes will be glued to the screen. Both Step Up movies have GREAT choice in characters because the lead roles in both films are gorgeous. Both girls and guys. I am a big fan of dancing movies in general, and these two both top my list. Ignore the bogus comments. Definitely worth watching. "
Australia             ,wfrost,1,adventure,2008,2,"Music from The Wizard of Oz is played and/or sung throughout the film and its characters are compared (unsatisfactorily in my opinion) with those of Australia. It's an in-group reference, since ""Oz"" is a common nickname for Australia.Is Baz Luhmann paying homage to Oz, Gone with the Wind, Casablance, Out of Africa, and every western and oppressed minority film ever made and creating a true epic, or is he patching stock clichés, plots and characters together to make a long film far inferior to any he references? Brandon Walters, as the half-caste Aboriginal, Nullah, and the film's narrator is one of the few leads in this WWII era story that seems at ease with his character except when he is in his ""doing magic"" pose. His mother follows her son into a water tank for no reason and drowns. in an earlier scene, that tank was full of holes. The other characters are mostly one dimensional. Hugh Jackman plays a character so flat he is coincidently only called by his occupation, ""Drover."" Being the stereotypical cowboy, he has no social skills. He drives cows, except when he is inexplicably driving horses through the cattle ranch owned by Lady Sarah Ashley.Nicole Kidman plays the lady to Jackman's tramp. Naturally these opposites must attract and the lady thaws almost to the point of looking as if she's truly in love.David Gulpilil plays King George, Nullah's grandfather and protector. Having played aboriginal characters for over 35 years, he knows the drill. His character behaves logically through most of the film but, near the end, still has a spear which his captors in Darwin evidently neglected to confiscate. Then he finds it necessary to reveal to Neal Fletcher that he is Nullah's father as if the man could not otherwise have known.Fletcher, played by David Wenham, is the chief villain in this melodrama. He is the architect behind everyone else's misfortunes excepting the Japanese bombing of Darwin and Mission Island.Mission Island is the fictitious location where Aboriginal children (the Lost Generation) removed from their parents were interred. We are asked to believe that the Japanese would send soldiers to this island so that Drover could rescue Nullah.The real star of Australia is the land itself. The vast expanses of northern Australia are well photographed and put the special effects and animation to shame. The Darwin harbor scenes and the kangaroo sequence would be at home in a B movie.With a bit more effort (or a bit less) Luhmann could have been responsible for a new film genre -- epic camp. "
The Strangers             ,dead_donnie,,horror,2008,4,"As everyone probably anticipated, this film is another in a seemingly endless string of unbearable formulaic pap that Hollywood has been spewing out for the past nine billion years. This film wasn't exactly horrible, and I admit I was hoping against all reason that it might succeed at least a tiny bit in creating an eerie mood and generating some genuine scares, but no, that's just too much to ask for. Without going in to too much detail, I can tell you that the first 30 minutes or so are sort of creepy, but the rest is nothing but cheap, unnecessarily noisy scares and way too many glimpses of these totally unintimidating people in stupid looking masks. And yes, as the previews implied, the movie really does revolve entirely around the gimmick that these people are wearing scary looking masks. And that's it. The highlight of the movie, for me, was the ""hey that's the dude from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia!"" part. So if you like watching Liv Tyler's upper lip continue to be bigger than her lower lip and people in stupid masks walking around banging on things, this is the movie for you. Oh, and it's completely anti-climactic as well. A true Hollywood gem. 1"
Deception             ,rajdoctor,0,crime,2008,5,"The trailer of this movie looked interesting.The story is about an accountant Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman) who meets Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor) <U+0096> who in turn introduces Wyatt to a secret sex club. Wyatt falls in love with one of his acquaintances S (Michelle Williams) and gets involved in a blackmail by Jonathan who wants Wyatt to transfer a huge sum from a few bank account to Spain. Wyatt does that. Jonathan plants a bomb and kills Wyatt. I will leave the story here and not play spoilt sports.The story starts with a psychological angle, moves to sexual contours, deceive, and blackmail. The movie moves slowly throughout, gains maximum interest in the deceiving part <U+0096> holds your attention, but remaining times <U+0096> it is just a usual dull affair.Both Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor look great and act well. But the style of narration does not build up that interest to make a great cinema of a good story like this.First time director Marcel Langenegger does a decent job in delivering a visually good cinema <U+0096> good closeups, good acting, good music, good movements of camera <U+0096> I think he has a good eye for making better movies.I think there is a problem with the scripting of the movie. It takes the first 40 minutes to build the story, and gives 10 minutes of interest and falls back to a mundane thriller.My rating started from 4.5 at the beginning of the movie, increased to 6.5 when it reached the deceive part, but pulmetted down to 5 by the end of the movie.(Star 4.75 out of 10)"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,swtwendy1,1,comedy,2010,1,"I thought this movie was really boring and monotoned. It was not funny at all. Mila Kunis was absolutely horrible at her acting. She was really annoying. Her voice was enough to drive someone nuts. I thought this movie had no plot what-so-ever. All there was that happened was lots of sobbing, lots of stalking, and idiocy. Garbage. It tried too hard to be funny. It was a complete waste of time. I thought that it made no sense at all. The ending was sloppy and random. it seem like they tried to rush the ending just to get it over with. I had no idea why and how he even got to send a letter to the girl! The beginning was super dull and showed no relationship value between peter or Sarah Marshall. The acting was super phony. I think that the only reason why it would have good reviews is because of all the excessive sexing and apparently Mila Kunis' tits.. which is not even a real picture of her.. its photo-shopped. so think before you even bother to watch this stupid movie."
Goodbye Solo             ,Jackpollins,0,drama,2009,10,"In the drama, Goodbye Solo, two men form an unlikely but beautiful relationship. Solo (played greatly by Souleyman Sy Savane) is a cab driver who cannot take no for an answer. One day, he picks up William (Red West), a lonely man who is lonely because he does not want any friends. William cannot decide if he hates people more or himself. Despite William's hatred toward people, he lets Solo help him. Solo isn't exactly happy, either. He has been having marital troubles with his wife Quiera (Carmen Leyva), and his daughter, Alex (Diana Franco Galindo) wants nothing to do with him. These two men have the fact that they are unhappy in common, and build their relationship on that. That's the magic of this movie, they have nothing in common except for the fact that both they have both hit a rough part of their life. This movie is quite flawless. It's sweet, humorous, entertaining, and just pure magical. This is one movie you should not miss. You will feel bad if you miss it. See it right away, and you will be extremely happy that you did not miss i"
Slumdog Millionaire             ,katiemeyer1979,0,drama,2008,9,"An exhilarating realistic fairy tale that will make you feel like flying. I certainly felt it. Rewarding without being opportunistic. This tale of two orphan brothers in a slum of Bombay is a mixture of heart wrenching and uplifting emotions. I didn't know anything about the film other that what I just mentioned and that was part of the enjoyment so I won't talk about the film to allow you the same discovery I went through. Let me just say that this is Danny Boyle's best film and the cast of unknowns is truly extraordinary. The last few minutes of the film will have you on the edge of your seat hoping against hope that what ""is written"" is really written. 1"
Flash of Genius             ,orglit1,0,misc,2008,10,"One of the outstanding virtues of this movie is the didactic sections, informing audiences a little about electrical circuits without interrupting the story. Inventor Bob Kearns and, later, an attorney representing Ford Motor Co. both talk about capacitors and resistors lightly. It enables lay folk to get a peek inside their electrical and electronic devices, even to ""spark"" curiosity in some viewers. Some of our general fiction literature but our general fiction films rarely are didactic about science, even though they have the capacity to teach--one thinks of John Steinbeck, of Herman Melville before him, and of some contemporary novelists, too."
The Women             ,aharmas,1,comedy,2008,4,"I believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood first started talking about such enterprise, the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and that's exactly where things begin souring here, with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work, but that are not suited to the parts, and sadly enough, have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material.It seems as if there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film. This is called an updating, as in let's drain the story out of humor, snappy dialogue, and any interesting premise. Most of all, let's prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't really get (at least by watching this film) where the women are truly going.For starters, casting Meg Ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances, even after 20 years of working in the movies. Her Mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's, somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes, like Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" by learning, observing, and realizing that she had a choice in the matter. It might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays, but it was fun ride, and part of the fun, was the catty, silly, sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime. In here, we are down to earth with a thud. By changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its spark, and it isn't in anyway Annette Bening's fault. I couldn't help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled. Thankfully I entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. Her Sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately Ms. English wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction.Yet that wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all. In the original, we have Joan Crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman. Her Crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, duplicitous maneuvers, and some very sexy poses. She was the link between the male and the female, and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intelligence that we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as gorgeous as she is, is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing, and once again, some bad casting.There are more atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role for Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies, and the rather annoying lesbian turn by Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie, as Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her make up, shows the spark of what could have been. Her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken. Her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film, and it is exciting to see that it could really fly, then she is gone. She is in the film all of six minutes, and she fades away in the middle of the muddle.Here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us, a film that could have joined the successful ""Sex in the City"" who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise. It gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. It truly updated what had made it successful before. ""The Women"" in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself, much like ""The Hulk"" did it this year, find more suitable performers, a really good writer, and most of all, someone who truly treasures what good movies are about. 1"
The Objective             ,SniperM24,,horror,2008,8,"It never ceases to amaze me that people that cannot do something will bag on others that not only can, but DO. While some of the folks on the board have some valid points, there's an awful lot of finger pointing by people that obviously don't know JACK about film-making and REALLY DON'T KNOW JACK about the military and the soldiers that serve.I saw the 1st & 3rd shows and flat out don't agree with the folks that are panning the film completely. They're wrong in my opinion, and opinion is all that they are throwing out here, theirs. On the other hand I've read some good reviews from several sources that do that for a living, unlike the erstwhile reviewers here. Fangoria for instance seemed to like it just fine (check their website), warts and all. Hmmm...tough choice on who to believe. To be fair I've also read some of these bigger reviews that are not as complimentary, but nothing like the vitriol I've read here.So up front yes, I liked the movie (so I'm biased in that direction). Yes, I know some of the folks on the crew (no I was not on the crew). I was in Army combat arms for many years and served overseas, so I feel more than qualified to comment on that aspect of the film. Did I think it was amazing<U+0085>no. Did I think it's the best I've ever seen<U+0085>no. But for what it was, what it cost, and how much time they had (or in fact didn't have) I think it was better than many I've seen and that they did quite well with what they had. For god sakes, some of you here act like this is a UWE BOLL movie. There's no way that this is anywhere near as bad as Blood Reign and they had 25 million and star names.So<U+0085>on to comments. So far as I can tell everyone seems to agree that the cinematography was good as was the score. I think the score was great myself. A lot of folks don't care for the ending<U+0085>or hate it. I can't say I loved the ending either, but it didn't confuse the h*ll out of me like it seems to have done to so many. I too could have lived without the acid trip. But just because the vast majority of folks MUST have the end of a movie neatly wrapped up, must have it explained, don't want to exercise the muscle in their brain housing group does not mean the movie sucks. If you think the end was lazy film-making I'd challenge that's it's just as much lazy film viewing.There were some less than flattering comments on the actors. I just don't see it. For those that thought that the soldiers' dialogue seemed clichéd<U+0085>real soldiers use clichés all the time. I used to quote any number of my old drill Sgts. clever little snippets. We do it constantly. I found these guys to be some of the most realistic soldiers I've seen on film in a long time<U+0085>maybe because THEY WERE REAL SOLDIERS, for the most part. They acted, talked, and moved like most of the Special Ops guys I ever saw for real. I saw the 3rd showing and there was a real Special Forces guy in the audience asking questions during the Q & A. I got to listen in on him talking afterward to the actor that played the team leader (Matt Anderson), who was also really a Special Forces guy it turns out (came out in the Q & A<U+0085>cool). This guy was telling him how impressed he was with the way the guys talked, moved, and carried their weapons and that it surprised him because he didn't know up front that any of the actors had military experience. As for them ramping down during the last half of the flick<U+0085>did you miss the whole part about them trudging through the desert with little and no water, among the other things? I'm sure they'll try and be more peppy next time they're supposed to be on their last legs in a film. Can't say I disagree completely about the monotone voice overs and a few of those clichés, but overall I thought these guys were GREAT! While everyone is righteously allowed their opinion, I think the majority that don't really like the acting have very little idea of what real soldiers are like in the field. Especially real Special Ops guys in a combat zone. Maybe ""Commando"" or ""Rambo"" style was what you guys wanted.This is becoming a diatribe now<U+0085>sorry. But quickly on a few other comments. Day night day night<U+0085>yeah, a pain. Only a little blood<U+0085>are you serious? What movie, with what director did you think you were going to see? Go watch Dawn of the Dead for that. Plot holes, characters doing dumb things, etc. I agree completely with most of these points. On a lot of this, the director talked about having to cut about 30 minutes out of the film. Apparently they also lost several cans of film when customs opened them and flashed the negatives (Q & A). Any of you ever made a film? What do you do when you MUST cut the time or you've lost footage? Go back to Morocco and re-shoot it all? No, you do the best you can. But maybe all of you walk on water.I think that the film has some warts and could have been better, but I think that they have a decent film that is better than 98% of the films on Sci Fi channel (not sure that's necessarily saying much) and the cast has nothing to be ashamed of, especially the soldiers. Take that and add their small budget, shooting in the desert of Morocco, doing it in 24 days, and having the problems they did<U+0085>.well I'd say they did a fine job!"
Gran Torino             ,tile46,0,drama,2009,2,"It seems that Clint has embraced his old age rather gracefully. He's grumpier and creepier than ever. But still has that wonderful edgy flair that keeps us coming. His performance was wonderful and no one could have possibly played a racist Korean war vet quite like him. That aside the movie was terrible. Not because of writing flaws or cheesy one liners, like I expected, but because besides good old Clint, no one in this movie bothered to act. It was bazaar. Clint was spectacular, but everyone else looked like they were just reciting words on a page. I've seen better performances at middles school Shakespeare shows. The preacher had only one emotion, and it was so vague and useless that I couldn't actually understand anything he did. The bad guys were comical at best and the loyal friend, Toad, or what ever, was so unconvincingly angry that I just wanted Clint to let him out of the cage and get killed so I wouldn't have to watch him pretend he was enraged. Apparently, in his old age, Clint has forgotten how to direct actors. "

Whether that was a positive or negative reaction was communicated as people filed out of the theater, many with a puzzled and confused look on their faces. I've rarely seen so many unhappy expressions.My reaction: truly magnificent and totally stunning and innovative work as far as cinematography, editing, casting, music, sound effects, art direction.

Goodbye Solo             ,girlocelot,0,drama,2009,7,"This director will one day make a great movie. This isn't it. But it's worth seeing for the stellar performances, particularly by the incandescent Savane as Solo. All the actors are excellent - Diana Franco Galindo, as a ten-year old is great. The textures of life, the little details that tell you what the characters lives are really like are very well done. Bahrani has good ideas, artistic vision and technical prowess.You could compare him with the Dardenne brothers. But they have mastered the roughly-hewn, realistic, pithy story, and they have developed their own unique, humanistic and supremely crafted way of telling their stories. In their films, the characters and their lives pull the story along. Their films pulse with thrumming heart-beats. GS doesn't. I almost don't want to criticise Goodbye Solo, but I must because I think Bahrani can do better. GS doesn't gel all the way.

Frozen River             ,matmag361-365-953102,1,crime,2012,9,"""Frozen River"" is an example of what great indie film making is all about.Instead of special effects and outrageous plot twists, we are shown real people caught up in some of the significant issues of life.First let me say that the acting by Melissa Leo, and especially Misty Upham is superb. Both characters grow in stature as the film progresses; what seem to be clichés at the start become powerful archetypes. The direction and cinematography cannot be faulted anywhere. Just well done all the way, without drawing special attention to itself. They let the story take preeminence. ""Frozen River"" will challenge your way of seeing cultures, borders, and family. It is the type of movie that stays with you. Don't miss i"
Twilight             ,AnnaShade,1,misc,2008,NA,"I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a film. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight fans. I probably won't ever want to see it again, but it's okay at midnight with some school friends who like it or something. 4"
The Escapist             ,thomasthetanker,,crime,2009,9,"I didn't vote on any films in 2008. There were plenty of decent films but nothing made me want to post on IMDb, whatever I want to say has always been put more eloquently by someone else. But this film deserves credit, naturally I checked here before I watched but afterwards I felt compelled to demonstrate some appreciation. No, you moron posters, it is NOT Prison Break, neither is it trying to be. After it finishes you'll want to watch it again. It looks real and gritty definitely not studio. I don't know enough about film to tell you if it was the script, acting, filming or anything else, it took me to a different place - Isn't that what we want most in a film? "
Stop-Loss             ,Ric-7,0,drama,2008,7,"Maybe the idea was to show the total hopelessness of the conflict--that it was not really a war but urban warfare, and that there is no way to win or to have a happy ending. But that's just an idea--it's not a movie.I thought that the set-up was fine. But I am not sure the filmmakers knew where to go with it. Their take on the stop-loss policy is obvious, and it is a message that should be heard. But I think the film would have been more interesting if any character exhibited any real growth during the film. The vets were all depicted as basket cases--the most well-adjusted vet seemed to be the double-amputee--he told us why he would want to go back to Iraq and there was at least some productive purpose that would have been served by his return there.Perhaps there are soldiers who don't mind being stop-lossed--who truly believe they are accomplishing something positive over there. It would have been refreshing to have a character like that--a non-basket case. It would have been good to hear arguments supporting the stop-loss program (if there are any).The last 20-30 minutes of this film were baffling. The end of the film (not an ending, just an end) was very unsatisfying.Ryan Philippe did a competent job, but rarely conveyed anything not apparent from the lines or situation. For example, you could see that a lot of his post-war angst was attributable to guilt. How that tied in with the ending is just a mystery to me.I recall that a very similar military policy was explored by Joseph Heller in Catch-22. I think a comparison to that novel and film is more apt than comparing this to The Deer Hunter.I wish this film could have been much better than it was."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,svinnacombe,0,action,2008,5,"I reached a movie buff conclusion after the 2nd set of Star wars films. It's simply not possible to top an iconic, legendary film or series. The original can't be beat, and is next to impossible to match. Doesn't matter who directs, stars, the effects, etc - can't be done. Being sure of this in advance made the Crystal Skull easier for me to take - but I still have to be critical - because they let us down on the simple stuff. My other movie buff observation is - its ALWAYS the writing first. The STORY. The other stuff flows from that, making the film better or worse. In Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the writing failed us. The story does not hold together well and the dialog rings intermittently false throughout the film. I wanted to love the movie - but I was disappointed. When I heard they were all waiting for the ""right"" script to make another Indy film - that sounded good. But it appears that wasn't really true. I have to assume they all just decided the timing was ""right"" and it would be fun to get the old group together to do a flick - because the script was poor. The movie is more like an attempt at what an Idiana Jones adventure SHOULD look like - but with no real substance. A series of Indiana like dangerous situations and exploits strung together loosely with some attempts at humor thrown in. But no clear beginning to end plot. No disaster to avert, no one to rescue. Nothing in particular to root for... The actors seemed a bit uncomfortable to me - even Harrison Ford himself. Indy's love interest from Raiders (Marian) was underutilized and apparently a bit rusty in the acting department. She seemed to be just ""thrown in"" to add a nostalgic romantic element. The young Mutt character was well cast and did a good job with what he had to work with. The story arc regarding Indys age, his old love and young Mutt is dealt with - but could have been a better, more solid part of a more well written story. I'm glad I saw the film. I enjoyed seeing Indy again, but my hope that I'd be wanting to go again didn't pan out. It's worth only one visit - and that just to see some Indiana JonesLIKE adventures - in a story that doesn't make much sense. Sorry to break bad news to anyone who reads fan reviews - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. George - you should have fussed over the writing a bit more and Harrison - I'd have waited longer for the right script. This was a weak effort and it didn't need to be. Mr Lucas and Mr Spielberg -you surprised me on this one - and let us all down on the story. Just my opinion :) Scott (an Indy Fan). 795"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,woohooo,,animation,2008,NA,"I am a Veggietales fan. I enjoy most of the television episodes, although some are better than others. Jonah was a decent showing of the Veggietales on the big screen, but I have to say I am disappointed in Pirates.I just found myself bored. The laughs were few, and very far between. The storyline was not very original, very predictable and I miss the Biblical lessons that Veggietales are known for. There was still a lesson, but not one we haven't heard before in a billion other better made movies for the secular audience.I was trying to pay attention to how the kids in the theater were reacting. I heard one young boy behind me say ""that was good"" when the show ended, but I'm not sure if he was remarking on the ""Rock Monster"" (think B52s ""Rock Lobster"") song at the end, which is catchy and lighthearted (too bad more of the movie wasn't that way) or if he meant the whole show. The kids didn't seem to fidget too much while the movie was playing...but I was.I just know that Big Idea has better ideas under its sleeve than this. I'm hoping their next venture is up to par."
Surveillance             ,StarkTech,1,crime,2009,NA,"Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. On top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from ""evidence"" to ""violence,"" I had the entire plot figured out. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money. I would truly be angry if I had paid to see it in a theatre.Anyone that labels this thing a thriller really needs to get out more. An awful, awful film in every way that matters."
Mamma Mia!             ,MOscarbradley,1,comedy,2008,10,"I have a confession to make that could land me in serious trouble here. I love this movie with a love bordering on the unnatural. Of course, I hear you saying, that can only mean one thing; you're a gay man of a certain age and if you haven't come out of the closet already. you're coming out now, and wearing sequins at the same time. No straight man, I hear you say, could love this movie with this kind of unbridled passion, so if you have aspirations to being a 100% red-blooded heterosexual male, (is there such a thing?), then keep any fondness for ""Mama Mia"" to yourself; you will automatically be suspect. Of course, I could just as easily be a teenage girl, (it's a chick flick, after all), and be in equally serious difficulties with my peers, for loving ""Mama Mia"" would then mean I had already turned into my mother, for this is a chick flick for the older chick and no mistake.I had avoided it on stage. I have never been a fan of 'juke-box' musicals where a plot is conjured up around a set of songs by a well-known group or artist. And my undiminished love of Abba, (there, I'm out of the closet - happy now?), made me shy away from, rather than run to, a show where their greatest hits were sung, karaoke-style, by others. But something drew me to the movie. Perhaps it was Meryl, (if Meryl liked it, it can't be that bad, I kept saying to myself). Perhaps it was the locations, (it all takes place on a very travelogue Greek isle). Perhaps, ultimately, it was the songs, (who isn't a dancing queen, after all). Nevertheless, going to ""Mama Mia"", the movie, was still like dipping my toe in the water before deciding if I wanted to do a full length of the pool. The last thing I expected was to fall head over heels, to turn into a blubbering mess, to turn into the oldest dancing queen on the block and into my mother all at the same time. ""Mama Mia"" is a guilty pleasure, (no self-respecting cineaste should ever admit to even liking this movie, never mind loving it), but as guilty pleasures go, this is the best junk meal you are ever likely to have.It's director, Phyllida Law, did it on the stage so at least she is familiar with the material, but she is new to movies and after the mess Susan Stroman made of ""The Producers"" I didn't really expect anything, but while ""The Producers"" was stagey,(and not in an appealing way), ""Mama Mia"" is genuinely cinematic. Lloyd's idea of film-making may be to let her camera roam all over the place, (she seems to have an MTV mentality), but she also knows how to build a production number. This is a fully-fledged musical of the old school. And now I am beginning to see the light. It's OK, guys, you can admit to liking ""Mama Mia"" without worrying too much about revealing your sexuality. Straight men are allowed to like musicals, too, aren't they? Then, of course, there are those songs, the ones we grew up loving. I read somewhere that Abba didn't write great songs because no-one covered them, unlike, say, Lennon and McCartney; that what made Abba's songs 'great' was the Abba sound. There may be something in that; the 'Abba sound' produced some of the greatest pop ever. Arguably, the songs that Abba, (and by Abba, I mean Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson), wrote and recorded are the greatest pop songs we've been given. So how do they work coming from the mouths of people who, effectively, aren't singers? (Ok, Meryl, we all know you can sing and act and probably split the atom at the same time, and the girl who plays her daughter, Amanda Seyfried, sounds very pleasant to the ear). Well, the answer is bloody marvelous. Most of these songs sound as if they were written for the film and not the other way round; in other words, they fit the plot in the way that songs in a good musical should and they are good enough to stand on their own.These are Broadway show-tunes and they aren't wholly reliant on 'the Abba sound'. So what if Julie Walters and Stellan Skarsgard croak their way through 'Take a Chance on Me'; by the time they get around to it I would have taken a chance on anyone. So Pierce Brosnan can't sing? Neither can Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen and yet we love them to bits. (Actually, Brosnan can just about manage to hold a tune and he makes a fairer fist of it than Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood did in ""Paint your Wagon""). And Meryl, of course, is wonderful. Our greatest living actress is having fun here. This is her first fully-fledged musical: I just wondered what took her so long, (her rendition of 'The Winner takes it All' is one of the great solo performances in any musical).But does any of this justify my over-whelming and totally inexplicable passion? Probably not, which is why it is inexplicable. It's not a 'great' movie, (although it could just be a 'great' musical); it often feels like a bunch of friends' best ever holiday video where they keep bursting into song with fully orchestrated backing, and it gives a totally new meaning to the term 'Greek Chorous'. So, obviously I am a middle-aged gay man with a full wardrobe of seventies gear. (I certainly haven't turned into my mother!). I mean, what other explanation can there be? Oh, I've just thought of one. It is a great movie musical and it's a terrific way to spend an evening. So I can now safely go back into my closet if I can find room among all the sequins and seventies gear. "
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,ntulini-1,0,misc,2009,8,"This movie puts on screen what all Italians know since decades: directly or indirectly Andreotti is behind all major events happened in Italy in the last 45 years. This is what we know, as we all knew that virtually all politicians at all level were (and are) robbing the public funds and make private deals with business men.The movie shows exactly this: we know it but we do not have the evidences.Sorrentino tries to bridge this gap by putting together a lot of informations that make a pretty clear scenario, but without evidences. The result is a portrait of a divinity: you know that is there, you know that everything happens because of his will, but on earth everything happens by chance so that the fact that Andreotti is the mastermind of everything becomes a matter of divine faith.The strength of the movie rests on the capacity to describe a personality that is so powerful that does not need to speak, does not need to go on TV, he is able to make things happen in a way that only Andreotti knows. Andreotti is above the politics, above the Church, above finance, above mafia, he is depicted as a power that stands on its own, someone who uses all the different leverages to rule.Andreotti got it away with his trials and only Andreotti knows how. For a man of his power, it was the least you could expect.At the end, Italians have to acknowledge that in the 20th century Italy was ruled by the King (shortly), Mussolini and Andreotti. But if you remember the Glossary shown at the beginning of the movie, through the Loggia P2, Sorrentino suggests that Berlusconi could be the person in charge to continue the job. Whether this is the will of Andreotti or not is a matter of faith."
Mamma Mia!             ,jess-154,1,comedy,2008,8,"TheFanCarpet.Com - Initial ReactionTake a Chance... It's Surprisingly Brilliant!While the majority of the film is brilliantly silly, Meryl Streep gives us an emotional show stopping performance of 'The Winner Takes It All. Who wouldn't pay to see James Bond singing 'SOS'? Pierce Brosnan was humorously over-emoting everything but it worked perfectly within the context of the film.Donna and Sophie (Mother and Daughter) are perfectly cast with an uncanny similarity in both looks and personality. Julie Walters almost steals the whole show, sorry I mean film, with her performance of 'Take a Chance on Me'.It does take you about 20 minutes to settle down from the excitement of this outstanding cast singing their hearts out. I'm not the biggest 'movical' fan but if go in with an open mind and a bunch of people and you'll leave uplifted and pleasantly surprised. 1"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,adventure,2008,6,"Honestly, I can't help but notice all the people who once again are rating this movie without seeing it and just because they suspect the movie is going to be bad, they rate it anyways as a one. Well, I'm going to once again give you an honest review, I saw this movie last Saturday and honestly enjoyed it. I know I'm going to receive a lot of bashing, but I always look at movies as what they are supposed to be, this was meant to be a children's movie, it's meant for fun. Remember how we all had those cheesy animal movies when we were kids as well? Well Beverly Hills Chihuahua is no different, it's just updated with today's world. I thought it was a good idea, we see all these rich people now-a-days with the way they just lavish their dogs with jewels that cost more than people's houses, it takes a little joke at it. The story is recycled, but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes.Chloe is a Beverly Hills Chihuahua who is just so pampered, with clothes, jewelery, and a life style anyone would die to have. Her owner, Vivian, has to go away on a business trip and leaves her party girl niece, Rachel, to watch Chloe. When they go to Mexico, Chloe is kidnapped and put into a dog fight... she is then saved by another dog, Delgado, who is going to help her get back to Beverly Hills. But when the man who runs the dog fights finds out that Chloe is worth something, he sends his Doberman dog, Diablo, after her. Rachel, the land scaper, Sam, and his dog, Pepi who is also in love with Chloe, are on the hunt to find her and get her home safe and sound.Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a fun movie if you give it a decent chance, I thought it was a nice chance from the constant CGI we always have with these animal stories. I was also impressed that the talking didn't look so fake with the dogs. I tell you though I'm convinced that the dog that played Delgado is the same dog from I Am Legend, that dog just deserves an Oscar, lol, come on, you gotta agree. Well, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a great family film, as for seeing it on your own or with a friend, I would say that it's worth the rental more so. It's a silly movie I admit, but I had a fun time watching it and I wish IMDb users would give this movie the fair chance it deserves.6/10 2"
Prom Night             ,pianoman904,1,horror,2008,2,"I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw ""Semi-Pro"" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next??? "
Yes Man             ,bopdog,0,comedy,2008,6,"Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a ""model-y"" kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in ""Almost Famous,"" playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the ""Tragically Hip"" and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.Jim Carrey was also very good in this. He is who he is--- goofy and loopy and elastic. This wasn't a ""Serious Role,"" such as Truman Show serious--- but wasn't over the top like Ace Ventura. Maybe he's mellowed with age. I liked him as a wild kid, but like him even more now that he is a bit ""evened out."" He is still hilarious--- but also a bit more human, and a bit more approachable.This movie runs through its rom-com paces, but each new scene, while a bit predictable, was nonetheless a pleasure. I felt uplifted by the end, and am very glad I went, even in the blizzard occurring where I am now staying. It was worth it! 2"
The Women             ,kookooketchu,1,comedy,2008,1,"This movie is not a comedy. It is not even funny in the ""this movie is so bad it's funny"" department. Rather, it is just plain bad. Other reviewers mention the bad lighting, but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery.Meanwhile, a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It is hard to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also hard to see the four characters as close friends. It seems like just a bunch of women thrown together, pretending to be close.I won't list all of the problems with this movie, as it doesn't merit that much of anyone's attention. (Nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it)."
Flash of Genius             ,crownek,0,misc,2009,NA,"I cherish this movie; a lot of this is for personal reasons. The film is well done; Greg Kinnear really impressed me with this and little miss sunshine.I am a sales guy who sells to big companies. I recently gave ford a free education in a service we offer, and it took so much evangalizing, repetition, re-explanation and hitting them over the head. I was astonished that a business this big didn't have smarter people.Then, when we gave them our price and offer, they said ""no thanks were going to build this in house rather than use you"".........I felt a visceral connections to Bob Kearns.Suddenly, Ford is an expert on this. I would talk to anyone who would listen, and I put my blood into helping them improve their business. I have a new opinion of the buying and technology that Ford uses to run its operations. One of the reasons they might be the ""least screwed up"" of the auto makers"" is their soul-less way of getting companies on their knees, and then kicking them down when you cry ""uncle"" for them.Sorry for blabbing. It just hurts to know we really wanted to help them , and help us make a buck in the process. And we were treated like dogs."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,rbritton,1,drama,2008,NA,"I went to see the movie ""The Secret Life of Bees"" over the weekend and I was just blown away by the stellar performances of all the actresses! I was especially blown away by one performance in particular and that was the performance of Sophie Okenedo (May Boatwright)--she is just a ""power house"" actress! I am a fellow southerner (Alabama) so this movie really was relatable for me. All three of the Boatwright sisters held a special southern quality that as a black female I grew up around. August (Queen Latifah) had the strength, maturity, business sense, kindness & ""southern hospitality"", June (Alicia Keyes) had the proud ""no-nonsense"" attitude, and May (Sophie Okenedo) had the home-skills, innocence, gentleness, along with wisdom beyond her years which was so endearing which could also be said of June because she possessed what we call ""mother wit"". They all three were refined and cultured. In my small town quite a few black people's homes had a piano or some type of musical instrument (whether you were rich, middle-class, or poor) or people in your family had some sort of musical or singing ability and this storyline was no exception. Dakota Fanning's character (Lily) and Jennifer Hudson's character (Rosaleen) quickly soaked this in like a sponge because as they both admitted ""they had never met negro women who were so cultured"" ended up rubbing a little off on Jennifer Hudson. And let's not forget the men in this movie--they were terrific also! Thanks to Jada Pinkett-Smith for bringing this story to the big screen! I encourage everyone to go out and see this movie and like me you will shed a tear or two (and I am usually not an emotional person)but if you don't then you need to check the ""batteries"" in your tear ducts because they may be ""expired"
Igor             ,thinker1691,0,animation,2010,6,"This strange inventive movie is straight out of the same ghostly, nightmarish imagination of the same company which produced such great films as 'The Nightmare before Christmas.'

The Women             ,julietareynal,1,comedy,2008,2,"As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatic movie lover I committed a terrible mistake. I went to see ""The Women"" The remake of one of my all time favorites. I've seen the original many many times, in fact I own it. My rushing to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for ""Murphy Brown"" My though was: how bad can it be? She must know what she's doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. The Botoxed women is a rather depressing affair. Meg Ryan or whoever played Mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan...another actress perhaps wearing a Meg Ryan mask - she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what Norma Shearer did in 1939. The new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. The ""friends"" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith are as disconnected as anything I've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. Eva Mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up. I didn't give it a 1 out respect for Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman 1"

I think Raven is a fairly good actress, and Martin Lawrence wasn't bad either. I loved Donny Osmond and his daughter (Molly Ephraim). They were so funny, and I loved how Raven and Martin kept running in to them! And I really liked Lucas Grabeel, he was really funny(and I really like him in High School Musical to). I do agree that it's a tired and cliché story but it was really cute and very funny. But I think that the movie could have done without a few things, like the genius pig. But overall I thought it was a very good movie. If you want to see a good funny movie, see this!"
I Sell the Dead             ,kannibalcorpsegrinder,,misc,2015,7,"While awaiting the guillotine, a man recounts the story of him and his partner's quest to dig up the bodies of the dead to deliver to a doctor for medical study, and how one such encounter lead to them encountering the dead walking the Earth.On the whole this one was an enjoyable if flawed effort. The biggest effort holding this one back is that hardly anything at all happens in here, as the action scenes here are so infrequent that it really stumbles around with its pacing. Concentrating on how they're going about grave-robbing as successfully as they are for as long as this one does really affects this one at rather large segments of time without offering a lot of interesting scenes here, and that also manages to expose other flaws here. by forgoing the horror action, there's other scenes here that need to take up that time which comes in the form of several lame subplots that don't impart much action on the action, as the involvement of the girlfriend serves nothing here with their relationship not really providing the obstacle it's supposed to be for them to keep their business secret. There's never anything about her discovering them and the scenes weren't all that integral to what's going on for the pace, while the constant scenes interrupting the plot going back to the jail cell aren't all that well-done either as it goes back to simply see what's already been given in the plot so there just eat up time needlessly. As well, the comedy here is a little goofy and not up to many individual's tastes here with the sound and music gags for many not really being funny which does come up as a potential problem. Overall, all of these combine together into long stretches of problematic scenes here that hold it down yet still offers some rather fun times here when it was doing something that these here are fun enough. The main fun comes from the second half as that's where the zombie action is mostly centered around, as it mostly starts with the eerie journey to the island with the night-time setting and heavy fog masking the source of the growls coming off incredibly atmosphere before the chaos and panic once they find the box containing the captive zombie and how he gets loose providing some stellar action in the escapes and encounters as well as giving off some solid gore. Likewise, despite not really offering a lot of action the opening does have some stellar atmospheric shots of the two out and about grave-robbing which is full of creepy and rather chilling scenes throughout here. Along with the creepy make-up, these here make up the films' best parts here with these hold it up, though as a zombie film this is lowered due to their lack of screen-time.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Languag"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,callaxo,1,misc,2012,4,"3 years ago I read the series to the sisterhood of the traveling pants,I never got to see the movies.Only a few days ago I decided to read the series again,vaguely remembering anything that really happened in the books.I also only recently found out that they made 2 movies for them too so right after I just finished the series I saw the movies and I have to say I am disappointed.I know the books are pretty much always considered better than the movies because you imagine everything yourself and how everything goes but the movie was just completely different,I really feel like they could have made a movie for each book instead of just jumbling some parts all into one movie.I really really wish they would create a series of movies and have more of the details and use different actors too.I don't know I just feel like a lot was missing.you might think there wasn't enough in each book to make a movie for each but I really think it could have worke"
Stop-Loss             ,moutonbear25,0,drama,2008,7,"A bunch of American army boys waste away their time at camp, horsing around and yelling obscenities at each other while they wait their next posting. The style is gritty and raw. There are no Hollywood glamour shots of pretty boy stars, Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum or Joseph Gordon-Levitt; there is just confusion over where their day is headed. Before long, the team is manning a road blockade. Director Kimberly Pierce keeps the framing and the editing tight in this opening sequence and shoots the intensity high into the clear-blue, Iraq sky. Each car that approaches the young, scattered soldiers could be a disaster. One second they're lusting over a girl back home, the next they find themselves in the middle of a full- on ambush. The lot of them all fall into line and show what good soldiers are made of <U+0096> boys that become men in a moment's notice without thinking. And then they fight. Moves are made in as calculated a fashion as is allowed in the back alleys of a foreign land. Some of the men live and some die fighting. Within minutes, STOP-LOSS has you and then without warning, the film suddenly turns into a hip-hop musical montage, establishing the stop- and-start pulse of the film that ultimately leaves it for a loss.It has been nearly ten years since Pierce made her fearless directorial debut with BOYS DON'T CRY. It was a commanding assault on the viewer's nerves with each scene building panic and mounting anxiety. You were never given a chance to breathe and the tragic story it told became unforgettable as a result. This is why it is all so strange to see her impose breaks upon the viewer. Not only does it grind the flow to a halt in the dirt but it also exposes the need to repackage the current wave of Iraq war themed films. On the one hand, it makes some sense to cut the film together in an MTV-inspired style to market the war to the generation that is actually fighting it (it should also be noted that the film is MTV produced). On the other hand though, this approach subsequently comes across as a compromised version of Pierce's potential vision. That said, perhaps the new design is necessary in order to get the film's important message across and heard.The message in this latest condemnation of the Iraq war effort is to bring attention to the ""stop-loss"" process. The term itself refers to the army's right to force soldiers into another tour of duty at the end of the term they voluntarily signed up for. It is only supposed to be invoked when the war is still ongoing so you can imagine the outrage felt by Brandon King (Phillippe) as he is expecting to be signing his discharge papers and is told instead that he is shipping back to Iraq. Infuriated by his government's backdoor approach to get around the lack of a draft, Brandon goes AWOL in search of a way out. While taking advantage of the soldiers that enlisted freely to fight for their country is appalling enough, it becomes even more so when you see how messed up the returning soldiers have become after balancing being boys and being men in such devastating situations. Pierce's subtle presentation of the young men of Middle America is smart enough not to exaggerate their psychological damage but their table manners speak volumes to make her point. These are men who cannot carry on a conversation without recounting atrocious experiences they suffered through and have no concept of how uncomfortable they are making everyone around them. Another tour of duty could reasonably crush them if it doesn't kill them. With that in mind, Brandon's escape is not just warranted but imperative.At one point, Brandon makes a homecoming speech to the people of his Texas town. Midway, he is overwhelmed by how much he has been affected by the simple sights and smells of his home and he cannot go on. Everything he was fighting for becomes clear to him but a fellow officer interrupts his speech in favor of a more crowd-rousing message. People don't want to face the reality of the war; they just want to hear that their side is winning. And while Pierce's point is important and still firmly made, it is impossible to feel as if this film that took so many years to make is actually the film she intended and not a film that was designed to profit from a specific market. Still, it is worth applauding for providing a product that will be most enjoyed and appreciated by the demographic that is actually fighting on the front lines as opposed to an older generation that until now has been able to just sit back in the theatre and quietly criticize the war from afar."
The Express             ,russellgrace,,misc,2008,9,"Lately, I haven't been particularly excited or motivated about running out and seeing Hollywood films like I once did. Frankly, life is quite busy now and my well worn living room is far more convenient, comfortable, affordable, and enjoyable than most modern movie going environs.What can I say? The movie biz is a dog eat dog world and we're all living in a wait for the used DVD era.Being an armchair sportswriter and a bit of a homebody has made it pretty tough to beckon me out from my humble but cozy abode. Leaving mi casa means fighting through Los Angeles traffic, enduring rude audiences, sticky floors, snooty attendants, and exorbitantly loco cineplex prices all to experience a picture the old fashioned way... on the big screen. It has become a rare event.But every now and then a certain film bursts through the minutia to call me out and force me to enter one of those El Grande I-MAX theatres.One such film had me at hello - The Express.Ernie Davis' amazing life story is not only poignant in regards to football, race, and the American past - it also reflects today's America in respect to the central issue of the 2008 Presidential election - racial prejudice.The film wisely explores some of the same questions white Americans faced nearly 50 years ago about football, the Heisman Trophy, and tolerance that we are dealing with today in politics.Is America ready for someone other than a white man to cross the color line and become a hero? A Heisman Trophy winner? A President? Ernie Davis' life history is germane to the history being made by Barack Obama today.Some stories must be told. Catch The Express! Viewing this inspirational tale though a prism of our current, ""take off the gloves"" angry mentality that some people are expressing right now at this very second about Barack Obama are some of the same exact feelings expressed in reaction to Ernie Davis being the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Those old racist feelings of days gone by seem to mirror the irrational resistance to Barack Obama that we're witnessing today.This picture was worth every penny of my hard earned (but depleting in value) cash. As a son, brother, citizen, uncle, and most importantly as a teacher I was pleased that I'd plopped my overworked underpaid butt down at my local megaplex. It was worth it for the history lesson alone. As an avid amateur sports historian who's read a sports page everyday since I could read, I was shocked that I had never heard of Ernie Davis until now. For the record, I grew up despising the Browns.Some stories are not told because they are the too truthful. Catch The Express! It is a must see.Growing up in a typical rust belt city like Toledo, Ohio, we were taught that everyone in America was and is equal. But I never had a Black classmate in grade school. I was never taught about the great Cleveland Browns running back known as The Elmira Express and how he was drafted by the NFL but never made it onto a professional field because tragedy struck the star before he ever got his chance to shine.I didn't know that the myth of equality taught in school was just that... a myth.Ernie Davis, among countless other African Americans from generations past, have already shattered and crossed color lines time and time again but Barack Obama and his supporters find themselves up against some of the same types of fear, hatred, and bigotry once again.The Express once again proved to me that history never dies.Right now, in this very pregnant moment in American history, we must all embrace our differences in order to change, grow, and learn as a country. We must overcome our past and seize this moment which has been thrust upon us and not let anyone throw it away or steal our history. If you have a friend or family member who is still afraid of facing change and is reluctant to move forward and cross the color line then take them to see The Express. It will help them look back and understand that we've already been here so many times before.We've been duped. By the news media, by politicians, and by false promises of movie makers. We've all trusted those slick studio trailers designed by Ivy League marketeers who can manipulate our emotions. We've believed boatloads of charming celebrity pitches on Letterman between witty jokes and repartee only to walk out halfway through another disappointing movie scratching our heads asking why we went to see that piece of junk. But this story - steeped in history - has risen up and piqued my jaded interest and found my shrinking but surprisingly vulnerable sweet spot. I think it is my soul. Something from the past triggered that little voice inside my brain and kept telling me to go see this incredible true story about football hero Ernie Davis.There it is again. Catch the Express! Did you hear it? Don't be left behind standing at the station. Besides, my team has a bye week"
Untraceable             ,kingp_35,1,crime,2008,5,"Director Gregory Hoblit (of Primal fear fame) gives us a mildly engaging Horror/Thriller that could have been so much more. The premise of Untraceable is interesting and important in today's society but the execution is laboured and very disappointing. The plot focuses on a crazed killer who creates a website called www.killwithme.com where he streams live videos of people being killed in ever increasingly creative and torturous ways. The morbid curiosity of humans is the driving force behind the killings as the more people who log onto the website the quicker the person dies. This plot line should have allowed the director all manner of possibilities to explore current societal problems, but instead we are dealt a run of the mill film filled with all the usual clichés and a bucket load of plot holes."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,chatfieldbatham,,adventure,2009,NA,"This was a beautiful but ultimately confusing film.There is an impressive cast of photogenic and talented actors, but the editing seems to have left parts of the story, which would explain its progression, out.As a result, the story of the 'last' summer for the character played by Foster, it is only partly believable, and the poignancy that one can sense was aimed at, is missed.There is good acting by the main actors, but the lines provided and the editing leave a lot to be desired.It is worth seeing, but ultimately leads to a mix of emotions at the end, and not ones intended by the director"
The Ruins             ,ApolloBoy109,,adventure,2008,1,"The characters are spoiled, vapid lame brains. There's no one to cheer for. I am so tried of movies where the characters have to make bad, stupid decisions in orders for the plot to make sense.Killer foliage ? This just not threatening enough. Plant matter is so fragile. And there were just so many logical ways to deal with the lame attacks. The junk about ""not getting"" a signal on a cell phone is wearing thin. The first appearance by the vines is laughable. All 30 people in the theatre last Friday broke out laughing. The mimicking flowers sent us all over the edge. Clearly what worked in the novel, and our own imaginations, simply does nott transfer to film well. It's no wonder it bombed at the box office. It's silly and unbelievable . And every thrill is telegraphed to the audience minutes before it happens. My 14 year nephew got bored and went to see Nim's Island. The acting was so god-awful. Who are these people?? None of the pretty boys and girls could convey an honest sentence of dialog if their life depended on it. Are the actors from TV shows or just cheap labor?In a way I am glad it failed, perhaps now the coke heads of Hollywood will stop shoving hip horror films down the throats of our cinemas."
The Express             ,Darth-Furious,,misc,2008,7,"Based on the non-fiction book Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express, by Robert C. Gallagher, The Express: The Ernie Davis story seems to lose itself in it's own title. The name change signifies a young culture and generation completely unaware of the legend of Ernie Davis. Wait a second... there's a good title.Off the bat, I have to credit Rob Brown. At 16 years old this kid was squaring off impressive verbiage with Sean Connery and held his own. Now, his confidence shines even more. As Davis, Brown emotes without saying a word and strides through a script that tries but sheds little light into Davis's mind.Coach - er, Dennis Quaid disappears into the father role, replacing Davis's grandfather Pops (Charles Dutton) and polarizing every scene.God, I wish they had more for Clancy Brown to do. I mean, come on - it's Clancy Freakin Brown.So anyway, with most sports films, we get the basic hero plot wrapped around big game action scenes and the occasional fistfight. By the third act, the protagonists/ pioneers have broken through barriers, stumbled through plot twists and plot holes like a paint by numbers series and after winning the big game, celebrate - with hands high, flashing Colgate smiles and cheer into the epilogue.The Express follows the same formula until one remembers the nose bleeds. Wait a sec, it happens more than once? Yeah. That a loose plot? Not really. That was the relationship between Davis and Jim Brown or Davis and his girlfriend. What's her name? Sarah. There's just not enough depth invested into these relationships. So anyway, the nose bleeds are symptoms of acute monocytic leukemia. The hints are there like after-school special bookends and we, like Davis, have no clue what's happening. We want to dismiss it and move on - just like he does. That's the inspiration in this film. And it feels good.Overall, this is a film for the masses. It's strength is the push of a young man who was unaware of his own limitations in any event. Be it secure confidence or misguided pride, without that awareness - Davis could proceed and achieve to no end. The filmmakers stretch what they have to cover what they don't. All the facts are here. The history is too. But I wanted more. I wanted to see his struggle with the Big L - the unseen antagonist we waited for. Arrogant teammates, West Virginia racists, or even the slew of em in Texas (before the seemingly rushed ending) are nothing comparable. We move past it, onto the big night in Cleveland. But, that might be the writer's intention.I didn't have any sense about this film other than football. I had heard of Ernie Davis however I couldn't recall any significant details of his life to save my own. The details of Jim Brown and the Heisman Trophy are lost on non football fans. Even the fact that Davis led Syracuse to it's first national championship becomes a mute point. This film is about a man... not a football star.Brown and Quaid shoulder this film. The performances are so strong and touching... how Davis infects his weary eyed coach with his wisdom is a joy. The whole student teaching the master cliché is good. Oh yeah, there was this whole white/ black racial politic thing and everything (and anything) racist hits the front burners. Still, the meat of what drove Davis is key here. What caused this man to tick? What kept him focused and determined? When did he forget he was black? I have to big up Mark Isham's tender, yet powerful score. There were cues in this film that bring tears to one's eyes. Other good notes are any scenes with the wonderful, fresh faced Nicole Behaire as Davis's wife Sarah and Darrin Henson as a firm, but less formidable looking Jim Brown and again... Clancy Brown.Ernie Davis's story is remarkable to discover. The Express does it's best to give us the stuff of this young man's legend. Even through the gloss and shine of Hollywood's spin... it just feels good."
Quarantine             ,track_42000,1,horror,2008,6,"I had high hopes for this movie when I saw the trailer and felt that the movie delivered what it intended to.The movie itself takes place from the point of view from a cameraman named Scott. The cameraman is shooting a take on what firemen go through on an ordinary day when their ordinary day turns into extraordinary. They get a call to an apartment complex and get locked inside with what appear to be zombie like creatures.It is a movie that I would place in between the 28 days/weeks movies and Cloverfield. It has suspense (will be great on DVD w/surround sound in the future) but some of the characters lack common sense. The fact that the movie is shot from one camera had some people disappointed since it didn't involve too much of a story as to what is being ""quarantined"", but that is to be expected.I would say that the movie could have been a heck of a lot better with a solid story and a bigger climax/plot. It is worth your time to watch, but if you don't like shaky cameras like Cloverfield and Blairwitch Project, then I wouldn't watch it. "
Igor             ,dfranzen70,0,animation,2009,7,"In this animated comedy adventure, John Cusack plays the titular character, a sweet, intelligent lab assistant to an evil mad scientist who creates life, much to the chagrin of the mad-scientist community, in the, uh, person of a giantess named Eve. Although it's completely computer animated, the movie recalls such stop-motion-animation fare as The Nightmare before Christmas and the recent Coraline, not to mention the old Universal monster classics, whose old clichés get tweaked a few times.Igor (it's both his name and his profession) works for Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese), who's desperately trying to make an evil invention to enter into the Evil Scientists Fair. See, King Malbert (Jay Leno) believes that the town can prosper only through these evil inventions, what with the farming community destroyed by climate change. Meanwhile, Igor - our Igor - is much smarter than he lets on, as Igors are stereotypically supposed to be dumb, slurring oafs good only for fetching things and pulling switches. Igor, in fact, has already made two inventions - a snide, suicidal-yet-immortal rabbit (Steve Buscemi), and a dumb robot with a brain (Sean Hayes).Circumstances lead Igor to try to make his own evil entry - the creation of life itself, something the real evil scientists have never been able to accomplish. The result: Eva, a giant, giant, giantess who's... well, not evil. This is because her Evil Bone must be activated, see; to do so, Igor even takes her to get brainwashed, but instead of horror images Eva somehow watches an episode of Inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton, so when she emerges she's a struggling actress who's on her way to a big audition.Personally, I found this movie a whole lot of fun, probably because a) I love the old monster movies that are just skewered here and b) I love animated movies, too. John Cusack, one of my all-time favorites (I've seen more than thirty of his films) is great as the not-quite-evil lab assistant, and the animation is top notch, with wonderfully realized backgrounds that recall those old monster movies quite well. Steve Buscemi is an absolute hoot as Scamper, easily stealing every scene he's in - he gets all the great lines, but it's Buscemi's comic timing that make them come alive. So to speak. There's also a contextually perfect soundtrack, including a bouncy tune by Louis Prima called ""The Bigger the Figure."" Molly Shannon, who voices Eva, also delivers a fun, appealing performance."
The Burning Plain             ,yuwei-lin,1,misc,2009,6,"The pace of the film (probably due to poor editing) is inconsistent. The first half of the film is engrossing, but the second half can be easily predicted. A lot of scenes of the second half can be edited out. Apart from the poor editing, the story itself and the way the story was told are intriguing. The film is women centric and portrays many issues concerning women: breast cancer, housework/chores, mother-daughter relationship, postnatal depression etc.. Charlize Theron suits the leading role particularly after her outstanding performance in the film Monster. But there again exists inconsistency of her appearance in the film (probably due to make-up/lighting filming) - sometimes she appears younger and sometimes older. It's understandable as the director's debut, but I think the director needs to work harder in order to coherently deliver an engaging and technically sound film."
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,davispittman,1,misc,2015,8,"The sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 (2008) is a very sweet, cute, entertaining sequel that those who enjoyed the first film will for sure enjoy. All four of the main actresses so wonderfully in their roles, just like like in the 1st one. The movie has a great plot that is very satisfactory. All of the actors, with the 4 main ones included, carry the film very well! This is such a wonderful film to sit down one night with a bag of popcorn and really enjoy. And I think that guys will enjoy the movie just as much as girls, which you probably would not expect, but it's true. The movie really delvs into each of the stars characters and gives a lot more insight into them. Blythe Danner in particular did a really great job in her role as Greta, and had great chemistry with Blake Lively! In fact All of the actors had good chemistry with one another. The bottom line is that this film is a well made fun movie with a well written script. If u enjoyed the first sisterhood movie, you will love this movie!! 8/1"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,spdyeric,0,animation,2008,7,"I went to go see a special screening today at 1:00 at the Mainside theater in Camp Pendleton. My little brothers, 5 and 4, were very excited because they are huge Star Wars fans. I guess you could say I was excited too. Well, I did not know what I was going to expect, since this was the first animated Star Wars. First I must say this was not as grandeur as the other Star Wars, but I am pretty sure that it wasn't meant to be. And I know that this movie is going to kick off the new 100 episode cartoon. I was a little disappointed that they had new voice overs such as the one for Kenobi and Skywalker, however the new voice over for Kenobi is hard to tell that it is different. For Anakin, however, I did not think that there could be a more annoying voice than Hayden Christensen. YOu actually are going to miss Christen's voice. But I tried to not pay attention to that, which was very distracting, and focus on the whole picture, the plot. In my opinion, the plot was too simplistic for a Star Wars film because the whole entire movie is about Anakin and his new padawan, I forget her name, trying to rescue Jabba the Hutt's son. Thats it. Kenobi and Yoda are barely in the film. I loved the fight scenes and the ones at the end definitely pulled the movie up. And the grand scale scenes were pretty impressive. I wasn't too impressed with some the humor they tried to pull off. I mean some of the slapstick comedy sucked so bad that I almost wanted to leave ethe theater. there were some humorous moments that actually made me chuckle a bit but most of the comedy was meant for kids younger than 10 years old. Great movie for the little kids and people that are going to watch the TV series but you need to be a true Star Wars fan to love this movie. "
Frost/Nixon             ,J_Trex,0,misc,2008,10,"I enjoyed Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" and Anthony Hopkins' Oscar nominated portrayal was very good, yet the role was a largely negative version of the man. It was all deep paranoia and dark conspiracy, without any hint as to why Nixon was twice elected to the the highest office in the land, the 2nd time by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.Ron Howard's ""Frost/Nixon"" is a fascinating view of Nixon through the perspective of the David Frost interviews. Langella's portrayal captures the insecurity and paranoia of Nixon, but also reveals a more intelligent and engaging aspect of him during his post Watergate years. I suppose this will automatically disqualify Langella from any chance of an Oscar nomination. I hope this isn't the case, because Langella's performance is on par with Helen Mirren's in ""The Queen"", maybe even better. Ron Howard deserves kudos for directing this excellent movie. He's become one of Hollywood's best Directors of historical dramas. The supporting cast was great, Michael Sheen as David Frost was outstanding, and everyone else was excellent.A truly outstanding film and for anyone with an interest in recent American history, not to be missed"
The Objective             ,tuxlie,,horror,2008,5,"After watching this movie I came straight back on IMDb to see if I could make sense of what I had just watched. But after reading all the comments so far, I am none the wiser. It definitely did remind me of 'Blair Witch In The Desert' (with an Apocalypse Now style narration throughout) albeit without the hand camera so at least you don't feel queasy at the end, just a tad confusedHaving said that, it did command my attention until the end, and I did enjoy it. After about 1/2 an hour its pretty obvious that the ending isn't going to be neatly wrapped up so it shouldn't leave you too disappointed"
Frost/Nixon             ,janos451,0,misc,2008,NA,"I almost skipped ""Frost/Nixon,"" and I am glad I didn't. It's eminently worthwhile, one of the year's few films that deserves to be seen.My reluctance had to do with the expectation that it will offer nothing new to somebody who lived through the Watergate years and saw the Frost interviews (although remembering surprisingly little of them).Ron Howard's film is anything but ho-hum - if anything it's a bit too gussied up to be exciting. There is an element of discernible manipulation of the audience, but mostly it works, and you don't long resist it.The (relatively) unsung hero of the film besides Howard, Frank Langella's tremendous Nixon, and Michael Sheen's excellent Frost is the screenwriter: once again Peter Morgan (of ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""The Queen"") engages mind and heart, and doesn't let go. Sam Rockwell's James Reston, Jr. and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick (Frost's two collaborators) are outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's Nixon-worshipping Jack Brennan is the actor's best work in a long time.Morgan and Howard manage to make the viewer think constantly of another criminal President without saying or showing anything overt - they just let history, past and present, speak.I had a strange, uncomfortable thought watching ""Frost/Nixon"": even if some future film ""humanizes"" (not excuses) Bush the way Nixon comes through this one, W. would still remain a malevolent midget against Nixon's accomplishments and actual *brain*. How far we have fallen. "
Good Dick             ,sundevil27,1,misc,2008,6,"Took in this independent film from newcomer Marianna Palka at Sundance 2008. The audience was overwhelmingly appreciative of the film, though some were left perplexed due to the funny title which implied a comedy. I'll admit I assumed from the synopsis and title that this was going to be a comedy; a porn loving women is courted by a video store clerk, definitely sounds like the makings for some good sexual innuendo and lots of genitalia jokes. In fairness the Good Dick is very humorous in parts, though much of the time the humor comes from dysfunctional sexual material that would be uncomfortable if taken too seriously. The lead male played by Jason Ritter is a down on his luck and low on funds video store clerk who attaches himself to a shy and highly dysfunctional women played by Palka. Palka's character rents adult movies at his video store and wants nothing more then to be absolutely left alone. This obviously makes for an interesting courtship and interesting dates do occur, the video store clerk brings over his personal playlist of pornos and the women begrudgingly agrees to share her viewing time with him thus allowing the chance for something more. Palkas character shows signs of hope in letting our video store clerk into her life, but no sooner does she lower her defenses then she aims to hurt him in an attempt to keep her life less complicated and keep her personal problems hidden. Some awkward moments create some good laughs, but the laughter is just a slight distraction from the obvious pain that stirs deep within the women. Bits and pieces of ideas float throughout the movie hinting at the ending, but when the ending does eventually come it is still moving and should strike a chord with anyone who has ever cared so much about someone that they were willing to endure almost anything to connect with them or were on the other end and had to finally deal with something deep inside that they wished they could leave untouched and forgotten in the past. While the movie misses on a few scenes its still a very well done attempt at the strong subject matter.It will take a certain kind of audience to truly appreciate this movie for what it is, that could be tough for a lot of people who are uncomfortable viewing subject matter dealing with sexual dysfunction and the boatload of issues that brings into relationships. Regardless of content though Marianna Palka should be applauded loudly for all her work that went into this film, it's hard to imagine that she wrote/directed and acted in her first feature film. Also, Jason Ritter is outstanding in this role and obviously deserves more of our time. "
What Happens in Vegas             ,mario_c,1,comedy,2008,6,"This romantic comedy starts with a good premise: two strangers meet in Las Vegas and after an evening of wildness and many drinks they get married and win a prize of 3,000,000 dollars on a slot machine. They agree to divorce and split the money, but the Judge doesn't concede it to them, and force them to live together for 6 months, in order to make them try to succeed their marriage. It's the beginning of a living hell to them, because they can't stand each other<U+0085> In the beginning the movie has a bit of originality and fits perfectly in the ""it's so stupid that it turns out funny"" comedy type but then, step by step, it turns into an average and ""normal"" romantic comedy. It has great number of comic scenes and some of them are really funny, but if we exclude the beginning the plot really lacks originality and significance. We can see it especially at the ending, because it has the expected, conventional, and boring Hollywood ending we are all used to watch in this sort of comedies.I liked the performances of the main actors though. I think Ashton Kutcher is funny, in his own and particular way, like he was before on previous comedies; and Cameron Diaz still has that smile that I used to appreciate so much in my teenage years<U+0085> Of course it's not an excellent comedy, it's even a bit ridiculous and flawed at parts, but it's funny and entertaining, and for a ""typical average Hollywood comedy"" it's not bad<U+0085>"
Ghost Town             ,Dr_Kruger,0,misc,2008,8,"""Ghost Town"" is the story of Bertram Pincus, a dental surgeon who, after undergoing a colonoscopy and dying on the table for 'a little under 7 minutes' can see dead people. After being bribed by Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear), a dead guy who desperately wants his widow to break up with her new love, Bertram agrees to help and comedy/romance ensues.It's a fairly cheesy premise, lightly mocking ""Ghost (1990)"" you feel, although Gervais and Kinnear add some comedic backbone to the film. Leoni is surprisingly good in the fairly difficult role of 'widow in a rom-com' whilst having to be convincing in being attracted to Ricky Gervais! As the film starts off you begin to wonder if this is going to be the most cringe making two hours of your life. Ricky Gervais has never been in anything where he hasn't had complete artistic control over the material and in 'Ghost Town' he had next to none. It shows in the first 15 minutes where you just don't get into his character and wonder how the balance of his unique comedic talent is going to fit into a fairly typical Hollywood ""funny guy meets normal girl"" rom-com.However.......... as the movie progresses and his character is put in situations where Gervais is allowed to ad-lib a little and get some of those ""I can't believe he said that"" quotes out in true Gervais style to movie really grows on you. He really grows into the character and the middle third of the film becomes a real hoot.Then.......... the final third of the film comes and doubts start to creep in again, as we enter ""tragedy and love"" mode and I start to wonder if Gervais can pull it off. He does!, and I'm quite astounded. He's maturing as an actor and while I'm not quite sure if he'll get many leading roles, bit parts and even second billings as a cheeky side kick roles are bound to come flooding in for him.In the end it all becomes quite charming. I really believe the addition of Gervais's 'straight side' to his game could be the most important thing to come out of this film for him professionally, although if you still want a good laugh it's still well worth a look. Unlike a lot of films that fade, this one starts off on the wrong footing, but just gets better and better 8/"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,CihanVercan,1,misc,2008,5,"Don't trust either good or bad critics upon ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". It's a serious thing to castigate such a bold work. First of all, this movie is a mediocre adaptation of a heart-breaking novel of late epochs of the English kingdom and the royal family. This work of art(both novel and the movie) has a courage to reveal the unknown reasons of English kingdom becoming less potent with the Renaissance revolution from Italy, and losing the support of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, accordingly becoming adversaries with Italy.The Renaissance revolution is strongly flowing all over the movie just effectively with the Love. Yes, Renaissance invented the Love; but not lonely. There supposed to be growing artists, poets, sculptors, etc. Where are they? Even, we see the palace of the kingdom, the courtroom, the royal family's bedrooms all like a dungeon. Love wouldn't be existed, unless there is Art. Regrettably neither director nor the screenwriter is aware of the Renaissance flow of the actual novel. Hence the spirit of the movie is lost; and they still try to make us believe that the king of England is cruel and he has set apart the lovers. On the contrary, in fact English kingdom always had let literature, theater and love grow.Beside this failure, this fiasco of the plot; the cinematography and the costume design are stunning. The music score is outstanding, yet we feel that the whole movie is in a mournful silence.After all, we have a touching story with a great deal of melodrama in a sensational way. It seems like it took much effort to get together this powerful cast of actors and their cordial acting. Give it a try; at least it's worth seeing."
Death Race             ,A_Roode,0,action,2008,6,"I shouldn't write reviews for movies like this because it feels like I'm lining up to kick a puppy. A movie like 'Death Race' can only be judged fairly through a set of lowered genre expectations. I'll try but I'm not making any promises. It is fun, very loud and unabashedly dumb. It was never envisioned to be anything other than an attempt at 'cool.' The average viewer will - without fail - be able to pick out every moment where Paul W.S. Anderson had an idea during the script writing and thought to himself ""That'd be awesome!"" before looking around the room for someone to high five. I shouldn't pick on him because I actually do enjoy his movies. He isn't trying to make 'Casablanca'; 'Robocop' is more his style. Just without the boring stuff like characterization and development. And as little subtlety, satire or nuance as needed. Unless unintentional or totally by mistake and ironic -- That'd be alright.This movie's lone strength is the special effects and it lives and dies by the car chase, the machine gun firing and the gory death(s). Michael Bay, eat you heart out. Anderson knows the art of kaboom and action junkees should be satisfied with his efforts here -- especially during the second race when the 'Dreadnought' enters the race. As long as you numb your brain into not asking serious questions about things like physics. Or how massive amounts of armour on a car wouldn't make flesh and soft tissue any safer in horrifying car crashes. Or how the American economy of the Dystopian future has crumbled, but 70 million can still afford the pay-per-view price to watch. Maybe some of the viewers are from Canada.If you were to put any consideration into serious film criticism where 'Death Race' is concerned, then you'd be the first one. The movie is so predictable, lazy and unambitious that it asks you to hand it the popcorn. In fact, have you seen the trailer? You've seen the film. Tyrese's character is homosexual, which I thought was stunningly inventive given the scriptwriter. Sliding back into predictability, it is used solely to make a few tasteless jokes before being forgotten about. Pretty standard fare for Anderson. If you've watched his other films, you know exactly what to expect. Except less. Brain still hurts too much to think about it. I think the annoying thing is that Anderson has potential. I wouldn't keep going to his movies if I didn't enjoy them. It annoys me when the problems at script level are so apparent. He has a tendency to go to predictable places: Requisite gay jokes for the prison? Check. Incredibly hot women on screen? Cue horny Rap music since I need a musical cue to point out the obvious. I'm annoyed when one character asks another if they think that they're really the best choice of parent for their offspring and the second character says later ""Someone once asked me if ..."" like they and the audience have forgotten the specifics of the first conversation. The audience doesn't need to be spoon-fed the obvious. It's a weakness that I hope Anderson can shed. He clearly loves making movies. Trusting the audience a little more and giving us some credit might let him make better ones.The crazy thing is that despite it all, I enjoyed 'Death Race.' It is flawed from top to bottom but wears the flaws so honestly and endearingly that you really shouldn't hold it against the movie. Need to go see a mindless distraction for an hour and a half? 'Death Race' isn't a bad choice. With 'Death Race' you get exactly what you expect and exactly what you deserve. 1"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,AcousticWords,0,animation,2009,9,"Let's start with a big caveat: Yes, I know ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is animated. And, yes, I know it features a delightful little mouse. But this is not a movie for little kids! This movie deals with concepts that are beyond the understanding of most kids under the age of, say, 10, and in a way that can be, at best, disturbing. (I can just see Boldo, the Vegetable Man, causing all sorts of nightmares despite his benevolent and even heroic presence!) If you want a movie to keep the littlest kids entertained, go for something a little more Disneyfied. But if your kids are ready to be challenged in their thinking, consider ""Despereaux"".As for the movie itself, it is, as has been amply pointed out already, extremely well done. The animation is superb, and the characterizations deeply engaging. If they're a little clichéd -- who didn't immediately recognize in Botticelli the stereotypical villain? -- that doesn't detract from the overall excellence of the story.Some questions have been raised about the motivations -- and changes thereof -- of a couple of the characters. I didn't find the vacillation of Roscuro between good and evil at all sudden or jarring. Yes, it had to be condensed a bit to fit the time constraints, but the reasoning behind the shifts was clear -- Roscuro was unjustly persecuted for what was simply an accident and tarred by the general prejudice against rats; the fact that he held out as long as he did before giving in to his bitterness was not only impressive, but formed the basis for understanding why he was willing to stand up at the end and follow Despereaux's example of nobility. And while Miggery Sow did not actively apologize to the princess for taking her down to the dungeon (I don't think she was even aware of the sinister intentions of the rats, so to accuse her of trying to get the Princess eaten is, I feel, going too far), the point of the story was not so much the power of an apology as it was the power of forgiveness. Although we weren't shown the scene -- which probably would have helped clarify the story but added to the length -- it's clear the Princess extended her forgiveness to her maid as well.All in all, I found the movie to be a wonderful investment of time and money, and a very good source of lessons in forgiveness, acceptance, nobility, and tolerance.Just leave the preschoolers at home"
I Sell the Dead             ,JoeytheBrit,,misc,2010,NA,"I couldn't really see the point of this low-budget misfire. The writers choose a subject ripe for some rich atmosphere and detail, but for some reason fail to fit a story around it. The plot is framed by a confession of sorts, told by the condemned hero in the shadow of the guillotine (which I thought was used by the French, not the Brits, but maybe I'm wrong). Anyway, our hero, such as he is, relates his tale to a monk (Ron Perlman, the only real name in the film). He recalls how he was recruited into the body-stealing trade by Willie Grimes and how they toiled under the insatiable demands of a wicked doctor  until, that is, they discovered a sort of sub-market in the bodies of the undead (which means the film should really be called I Sell the Undead, but no matter).Now, as you can imagine, it's around about this point in the movie that all discerning viewers will probably raise their eyes skyward and either reach for the remote or, like me, settle down behind folded arms in the hope that things will somehow improve. The story, however, meanders along, wandering up a few dead ends, scratching its head, ambling back the way it came. Our heroes discover a baby alien in one of the graves they desecrate. They look at it with slight puzzlement for a moment before it is snatched from them by Cornelius Murphy, one of a rival gang of body-snatchers, and never spoken of again. Nobody seems inclined to explain why the ghoulish undead are being transported hither and yon or by whom, the audience are just expected to accept this traffic without question.I'm not quite sure what market the film is trying to attract. It seems to be aiming for irreverent black humour, but it misses most of the time. The ghouls are imaginatively designed, but there's little sense of period or setting due, presumably, to the meagre budget. When a film is deprived of such a vital component it's writing needs to be of a high enough standard to absorb the viewer and make them at least capable of overlooking its other shortcomings. I Sell the Dead fails to do this and suffers badly as a consequence<U+008"
Good Dick             ,therica,1,misc,2010,NA,"The movie is at times a bit slow, and the actress' acting a bit flat but that is part of the whole intriguing plot, which as you suspected at the beginning, is true.If you're hoping to see porn in the movie just because the descriptions seem to want to tell you that the woman is a porn addict, think differently. The only skin that you'll see is her naked back a few times.Although the plot unfolds very slowly, that's the point. There are some mental health and abuse issues here, and in real-time most similar interactions would never progress as far as this movie does by the end, and most likely far less successfully as the eventual turnout of the plot.Interesting, intriguing, not Oscar-candidate but a strong entry especially considering the topic(s) involve"
Street Kings             ,DaveDiggler,,misc,2008,2,"Street Kings"" is an over-the-top, unrealistic portrayal of corruption within the police force. Setting it in LA is the only way to make a film with such ambition of distorting reality even possible. LA is heavily diverse with all kinds of people which is a good backdrop for racism and more importantly racist cops. LAPD is also a place where the police have been scrutinized and publicly shamed for involvement in corruption that resorts anywhere from murder to police brutality to not paying for coffee. And in the one track mind of David Ayer who hit it big with ""Training Day""- which was a much better film, but also terribly flawed as well- just can't seem to get away from showing cops in a extremely negative light. Here he basically rips off his own film<U+0085> again- see ""Harsh Times"". The good thing about ""Training Day"" was Ethan Hawke's character. He was a good cop under the wing of a corrupt cop. There was a good and evil battle there. Keanu Reeves is supposed to be that good guy, but he's a veteran of 18 years and he has quite a history of corruption. Right from the first scene of the film he's puking because, naturally, he's an alcoholic due to the death of his wife. A lot of cops are alcoholics so it's only natural for the main character, once again, to be an alcoholic in a David Ayers film. Then he goes and buys little airplane bottles of Vodka- three of them- chugs them down, then proceeds to make a routine sell to a couple of Asians who are looking to buy a Machine gun. These Chinese (Or whatever they are) are the guys he's looking for in a kidnapping of two missing persons. Ludlow (Reeves) goes on a racist tirade about their looks and then they follow that up by beating the crap out of him. Only then does he tack them down and kill them all. That's what he does: He kills people. No warning, no police procedure of any kind, he's merely a vigilantly with a badge; a cowboy in the mold of Jon Wayne.The writing in this film is terrible. It's not even close to realistic and it paints a picture of corrupt cops who own the streets through fear and intimidation- they act the same way as the criminals do. Oh, you've seen that done before? Naturally you come across guys who cover up, set up, spree kill, kill other cops, get involved in drugs, and pretty much any kind of corruption you can think of in about a span of five days. This is made routine in an Ayers film which was okay the first time around. Now it's getting out of hand and it makes his previous films look even worse because we now see where Ayers wants to take this subject: No where. Ayers packs years and years of police corruption into weekend retreats as if it's an everyday routine: A casual drug deal here, an everyday spree killing there, and the usual torture-thing over here. This stereotypical technique of painting all cops evil is not unlike ""Training Day"" or ""Harsh Times"" where reality is not needed. You don't notice how bad of a writer someone is until they prove to you that they can't create a character that's three-dimensional or, more importantly, different. Ayers can't provide drama. He has to put his characters in the most extreme circumstance every five minutes because, when he doesn't, his films get boring with tedious everyday interactions that just don't work because they're not in any way, shape, or form realistic. If these cops aren't corrupt they're aspiring to be corrupt. The forgettable cast and the forgettable plot will probably leave smarter audience members with the same feeling I had. If I could tell Ayers something I would tell him this: ""Stop beating your stupid message that corruption exists within the police force to ad nausea levels that only a Paul Haggis could rival!! Stop it!! You don't like cops! Great, got the picture."" Ayers showed promise as a writer. Now he shows that he can't come up with a single original idea as his films stand on clichés, coincidence, and exaggeration. He adds nothing new that hasn't already been done- even by him. ""Street Kings"" depends on coincidence to drive the plot, such as a chase scene where a suspect runs through the neighborhood as Ludlow drives around the streets to find him (I think I've seen that before and if Ayers makes another movie I bet I see it again). Naturally, Ludlow is waiting for him and he throws something at his legs- looked like a chair, I wasn't paying much attention since I already knew what was going to happen- which takes the suspect off his feet as he falls into a barbed wire fence. This will also give Ludlow the opportunity to torture him by pulling him against the wire so it cuts into his skin. The man pleads for help as he thrives in pain, then gives in. Ludlow get's his answers. Not a single original idea is created. It's a work of dreadful perfection. The acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the writing is so bad it should have never been written let alone pitched, read, and then made. How did Forest Whitaker get himself involved in this? It's hard to even imagine his performance from ""The Shield"" compared to this hammed up, pay check cashing snooze fest. Of course he wasn't out done by Keanu Reeves and that one guy who pops in mediocre roles for some odd reason in big budget films. That dude's best acting performance came in ""Not Another Teen Movie."" Maybe you remember him? No? Me neither. They both were upstaged by Whitaker which shows that Forest can be a better actor than Reeves and the other guy without even trying- or at least he doesn't look to be trying."

Who knows (we know, but I can't be so rude), in the end is irrelevant, but at the beginning its kinda strange,,, The story starts almost the same as the original,,, and 30 seconds later changes completely,,, the original plot of a man fighting the 'ghosts' of his past, is changed by the plot of a woman fighting with the 'jelous and dead' ex-girlfriend,,, near the end of the film he screams 'he left you because he doesn't love you!!!',,, that's ridiculous,,, the end remains almost equal to the original,,, but it feels terribly empty: the original presents three people(live and dead) destined to have a shared destiny for the mistakes of one man,,, this remake shows a man receiving his lesson because he is a jerk,,, so disappointing,,, I tell you: Go, buy the original Shutter, watch it, enjoy it,,, stay away from this,,, thing,,, remake,,, whatever you call it,,, don't tell is good because you didn't see the original,,, even if you don't watch it, don't make this movie good,"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,trixieKitten,0,drama,2009,4,"My boyfriend and I had been looking foreword to seeing this movie for about two weeks, when we finally got to see it yesterday afternoon. We knew about the high ratings on this site as well as in our local newspaper, and by general word-of-mouth. What a disappointment. It was slow, bland, only occasionally humorous, slow, unintelligent, devoid of conjuring up real emotion, slow, silly, and the main character was not very likable-- just a horny womanizer fleeing from love and responsibility. About two hours through, my bf forced me to walk out and leave with him. I say forced only because I hate walking out on ANY film, no matter how awful, and I hate losing my hard-earned money. Even though I didn't see the entire film, I still feel the need to comment on what I did see, especially because I found out the details of what happened after we left... just more cowardice, silliness, womanizing, and a continuously slow plot-line. Perhaps I'll give it another chance when it comes out on TV, or if I have nothing better to do and I don't have to pay to see it."

Deception             ,Red_Flag,0,crime,2008,2,"Ahh Jackman what have they done to you. It's a wonder how such talented actors were tempted by such a weak and uninteresting plot. Deception manages to combine a novel premise with one of the lousiest executions in history and in that sense only ever manages to succeed in one area. That's its stellar and often unused cast. Brilliant as they might be even the actors cannot excuse this joke of a movie being as bad as it is especially when I had high hopes for it.Truth is the only thing that is deceiving about this garbage is its sophisticated trailer promising a well crafted and gripping thriller only what we get is completely the opposite. Lacking in potential to make you want to stay until the closing credits and to be perfectly honest I nearly walked out. But surely if it's as poor as I described i would have awarded it a more ""unwatchable "" review. And yet with all of its flaws and mishaps Deception does get something right, well for 20 minutes at least it manages to capture a minor bit of interest.A disconnected accountant finds his mundane life injected with a new sense of urgency after striking up a friendship with a charismatic attorney in director Marcel Langenegger's sexually charged action thriller.Jonathan (Ewan McGregor) is an accountant who has lost his passion in life. When his powerful new lawyer friend, Wyatt (Hugh Jackman), introduces Jonathan to a salacious underground sex club called The List, the the dejected accountant soon believes he has found the woman of his dreams (Michelle Williams). His newfound happiness takes a turn for the worse, however, when Jonathan is named the prime suspect in the woman's disappearance as well as the theft of 20 million dollars.Early on, there is an element of aspiration lifestyle envy about it all, as if fancy clothes and well-designed surroundings really do make a life, if not at least the making of a good watch commercial. Once the twists start twisting, the film loses any sense of genuine human behavior and becomes a slave to its own chunky plotting. The movie that took a moment to name-check the German artist Gerhard Richter (and even pause to admire one of his paintings) gets left by the wayside.Once it gets up to speed, the various tricks and complications of the movie, written by Mark Bomback, are so baldly cherry-picked from other films that it half seems as if Deception is meant as some kind of Sexy Movie parody to go in line with the recent Epic, Date and Scary entries.My Final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. Deception takes its place among the outing of 2008 that were so dull and uninteresting that its almost impossible not to walk out. If you're interested in such erotic thrillers however your best of seeing the massively overrated Original Sin starring Antonio Banderas. As for Deception your best of leaving this one otherwise you'll just be regretting your decision the Moring after."
Adoration             ,edumacated,0,drama,2009,9,"i first saw this film while lying in my bath tub, and listening to my roommate have a stroke in the next room.this film is full of false assumptions and perceptions--most caused by conventional, traditional and stereotypical cultural re-enforcements and programming, which color objective understanding, and cause incomplete or false subjective conclusions.and this subjective obscurity is what this film explores. and i think it does it very well. it does it so well i felt like i was watching a bent, David lynch film: except this one had an intellectual purpose in confusing its viewer. it's a difficult film to watch. it violates many of the classic Hollywood narrative conventions, and also many cultural ones.but if you relax, and try not to judge the character's arguments themselves, but instead analyze the very process of argument itself, and how one's perceptions on an issue should be able to change as more information is offered, then you may enjoy the film. and you may learn that ego is no excuse for myopia.it's not a bad thing to change one's mind when new evidence is presented. nor should one be so emotionally or politically attached to a position that one can not be able to adopt its opposite. ego and argument should be separate. no bones will be broken.fro"

For me the characters hold equal credit (as the story) in the entertainment displayed in this film. My only complaint would be the sheer confusion in the story for the first quarter of this film. Of course everything begins to come together but a little more clarity as to what exactly everyone was discussing would have been nice. A minor complaint for an otherwise brilliant movie. "
I Sell the Dead             ,Rabh17,,misc,2010,8,"This one is an easy-going story. It's a tale, told first hand, of two friends in England who make their, ahem, living, by Grave-Robbing.As it is with British-type humor, the funny is in the dialogue and the setting without the usual blunt-nosed set-up that Hollywood sets you up for. Laid back, because the humor is the type that makes you smile afterward as opposed to guffawing out loud -- but funny just the same.And here and there, throughout, the touches of the Macabre are incidental set pieces that are just 'A funny thing happened on the way to the Graveyard the other night. . .' rather than the central horror of the movie.

Untraceable             ,LAKERS34,1,crime,2008,8,"Diane Lane and a strong supporting cast make up for a ""been there-done that"" crime drama. The story contains a few original twists as well as a few serious implausibilities. Nevertheless, the direction, pace, and performances, especially Lane's and Bill Burke's, draw you in and by the abrupt conclusion, you are on the edge of your chair. Burke and Lane, as rival investigators, develop an interesting chemistry that builds through the film and is never compromised. Joseph Cross gives a creepy, effective performance as the deranged techno-killer. The fact that the story gives him such amazing capability to the point that you occasionally start rolling your eyes should in no way deter from his acting.All in all, nicely packaged if somewhat contrived; The story hinges on the fact that this ""wunderkind"" killer can continually crack every computer in his way, stay one step ahead of the law, and continue to capture victims for his morbid shows without skipping a beat. All that IS hard to believe, yet ""Untraceable"" was still satisfying entertainment."

Too many ""WTF?"" moments in both the action and the plot to enjoy this movie unless you really relate to a frustrated nobody stuck in a dead-end job and you want to fantasize about becoming an assassin. I can't figure out what was worse, the few Matrix type rip offs or the bizarre Rocky type killer training session? Also, how did they manage to make Angelina Jolie so unattractive? Not only does she look anorexic but add in the God awful tattoos and there is NOTHING sexually appealing about the character.Ridiculous, un-inspired action mixed with possibly the dumbest plot of any movie this century means Wanted is one to avoid at all cost. 3"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,mao-54,0,drama,2012,4,"First the cruelty. Yeah, I'm a tree hugger and that's why I think imagery of firecrackers put inside living fish and the senseless batting of fireflies with tennis rackets is a terrible message for children and impressionable young adults. As for the characters -I just didn't like them. Ryan Reynolds was pretty flat, smoked cigarettes, and didn't seem like the same kid that grew up. And then I'm just tired of seeing women -like the one Julia Roberts portrayed- getting mentally abused and just taking it. Don't bother with this one. I love Carrie-Anne Moss but there was little development of her character -in fact I couldn't figure out her relationship to everyone and I'm not about to sit through it again. And then, probably worst of all, I'm really tired of watching drivers turn their heads for several seconds to talk to the person next to them. Let's work on fresh material, Hollywood"
A Christmas Tale             ,xoxoamore,1,comedy,2008,2,"What a waste of great acting talent. This is a shame because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni, and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention others less well known in America) that's a lot of acting talent to waste. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After having enjoyed his ""Kings and Queens"" and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I actually left before the movie ended. The movie wandered around its central storyline (involving Catherine Deneuve's illness) getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen. The movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much (this was a story of family dysfunction) so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (which ranged from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream) was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time. The photography (the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen, where our only sight is through a small opening, making feel as if we are watching through a peephole, that then expands) was also pretentious and inscrutable."
The House Bunny             ,manitobaman81,1,comedy,2014,7,"A paper-thin concept: After Playboy bunny Shelley is kicked out of the playboy mansion, she finds a job as the house mother for a sorority full of socially awkward girls. I refuse to totally dismiss this, because I find it quite engaging, in a guilty pleasure sense. It's meant to be goofy. Unfairly dismissed by some, this is a funny sex comedy. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. We know from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I give this paper-thin comedy a rating of 7 out of 1"
Wendy and Lucy             ,bob.gladish,1,drama,2009,8,"Man, I'm a sucker for this kind of picture. Realism. A movie about real people, in real situations, just like you and me. No frills, no fantasy, no flash. It's not that I don't like movies with these elements in them; It's that a prefer movies without them. I like Michelle Williams without the make-up - just a waif caught in a tough situation in a generic Americana setting. It looks like a small town, but I see the credits say it's Portland Oregon.I'm also a sucker for trains, so I loved all the train shots. Is there a symbolism to the trains? Funny how many times a forlorn train horn is heard nearby, punctuating the quiet desperation of Wendy's plight. I loved the security guy (Wally Dalton) - he shows us there's hope no matter what the situation.....there really is always someone who cares. I sure hope Wendy makes it to Alaska; she deserves to.For those who like this one, you'll like a similar movie I viewed just a few days previous; it has a similar pace, and feel as this one, and a storyline with a little more tension: ""Frozen River"". Catch it if you can."
Sex and the City             ,liisatherockstar,1,comedy,2008,10,"Being a fan of the series for years, I had pretty high expectations for this film. I was not disappointed by what I saw, and most other SATC fans I've talked to agree with me. The film jumps ahead 3 years in the characters' lives, and then intertwines the stories of the four women throughout the course of a year, as they each come to terms with the ending they found at the series' completion. I liked this approach, because it demonstrated the longevity (or lack thereof) of the happy endings the characters attained. The girls are translated well into film--I didn't feel like any of the 4 was rewritten or misrepresented from her role on the show. The male counterparts were all present--Big, Steve, Harry, Smith, Stanford, etc. The movie doesn't spend as much time on them as they do the trials of the female characters, naturally, and no relationship is depicted as closely as Carrie and Big's. I found the plot to be compelling and heartfelt and the female characters just as flawed and human and funny as they'd always been. And, of course, it wouldn't be SATC without the staples of designer bags and shoes, classic cocktails, and of course, a splash of nudity. 1"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,K2nsl3r,1,misc,2008,7,"This film captures much of the historical tensions that existed in 60s-70s Germany (and world at large) by focusing on one of its most visible ""phenomena"", the so-called Baader-Meinhof Gang, which was also called, even beyond the reign of Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, the Rote Armee Fraktion or RAF. The struggle between left-wing terrorists and the established political and state apparatus, mediated through the perception of the masses via mutual propaganda, makes for an interesting story and an important saga in Europe's confrontation with the limits of liberal democracy, and of the populace's flirtation with bloody acts of terror.This film tells the story in its crude general details, in the course of about 2½ hours. It focuses largely on three figures: Andreas Baader (portrayed as a rash control freak), Ulrike Meinhof (shown first as a timid reported and later a ruthless organizer of violence) and Gudrun Ensslin (the lover of Baader and a determined fanatic). Many minor characters pop in and out, and at least 4 or 5 countries are visited in the course of the group's exile and international reach. Many shots are fired, many bombs exploded, many victims (""guilty"" and ""innocent"") assassinated, and many plans hatched and botched.Overall, the film does a pretty good job at carrying the story forward at a rapid pace. At no point did I lose touch of the essentials of what's going on. I found the movie to be eminently easy to follow and a pleasure to watch. The best part of the movie is the first half, or maybe first two-thirds, during which time the focus in on the sympathetic figureheads (Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin). By the time they are in prison, the story is driven (as it was in real life) by a new generation of fighters, who are comparably less interesting and whose motivations remain a mystery. Not only that, but I thought that the ending of the movie was highly unsatisfactory. The last half an hour of the film is a real mess. It's not catastrophic, but it's still a huge step-down from the well-paced storytelling of the rest of the movie.Now, the movie can easily be faulted for being a superficial exercise in crowd pleasing. It focuses only on the barest of motivational factors. It doesn't care for depth or subtlety. People are portrayed as one-dimensional and events flash by so fast that we don't have time to reflect on what we see. Action is favored over thought (but maybe this aptly represents RAF's philosophy?): there are chase scenes, gun fights, bombings, sieges and a few orgies. Overall, the movie is a loud exercise in simplistic historical narrative. For example, we get the obligatory news reels of Nixon, MLK, the War in Vietnam and the student riots of '68... There's nothing new to be seen or heard here. Not even the actions of the Baader-Meinhof Gruppe itself are explicated beyond what everybody who has read anything about the group already knows.Still, there are many things that speak on behalf of the movie. For one, all the actors do a very fine job indeed. From Bruno Ganz as the head of the police hunt to all the youthful and anarchic terrorists, the cast carries the film from beginning to end. Martina Gedeck as Ulrike Meinhof does an excellent job, and her character has also been given the most depth and complexity of all the RAF members. There are a few caricatures, but mostly the failures of character development in the movie have to do with the lack of time given to each character on screen. As others have pointed out, the sheer massiveness of the scale of events and the extensiveness of the timeline means that the movie cannot delve into any particular aspect of the story at any length. The actors do a fine job, however, and all the sets look authentic: the mass rallies organized by Rudi Dutschke and the violent demonstrations between the students and the cops (all very early in the film) are very effective in depicting the mood and reality of the era. The beating of the students is a harrowing image that leaves nothing for imagination.Speaking of the conflict between authority and rebellion, I think that the true strength of this film is precisely in its non-ideological and non-preachy tone. It offers a certain amount of reciprocal faulting between the pro- and anti-Baader-Meinhofians, and it certainly condemns the anti-civilian actions of the group, but it gives Bruno Ganz a few definite lines that summarize the essence of the conflict - something to the effect that ""even while condemning, you have to understand the real causes of terrorism"". This sentiment, while hardly new or deep, is an important one in a movie that otherwise could have been turned either into a Bonnie and Clyde romance or an exercise in retrospective character assassination. And make no mistake, all these people are portrayed in less than flattering light. Still, some amount of humanity is allowed to shine through, and this is what makes the movie SLIGHTLY more than just another empty gesture in the perpetuation of a historical mythos.It is an entertaining, and very well made movie which doesn't offer much depth but, in its simplicity and straightforwardness, offers material in its pure density and lets the audience make up its own mind... Too bad that it ends so suddenly and unsatisfactorily as it does. That's a shame, because the movie could have been great. Now it's only entertaining."
Kung Fu Panda             ,ying_huang,0,animation,2008,10,"First I need to make it clear that since I was born and grew up in China, this review might be biased because there is so much more I appreciate from the movie, given my cultural background.There is a specific category in the Chinese literature history called Kung Fu fictions and it had spread among generations currently between 12 - 60 years old. Have to admit, this movie touched deeply on that, far more than any Jackie Chan or Jet Lee movies. Because it is animated, it leaves more rooms for imaginations.I am very satisfied with the movie, though I watched it with my American-born kids. It is still a typical Hollywood production, but somehow, it touched my Chinese heart.It is a simple story, yet deep. See it if you haven't already."
Saw V             ,EJasonNYM,0,crime,2008,5,"While this is still a watchable, well acted movie that continues on the Saw tradition well I have to give it a lower rating because it just was not as good as the previous installments. The plot and the traps that we have come to be surprised by seemed to be a more predictable and rushed along by the makers of the movie. It seemed like this movie could have just been tossed in with part 4 to make one big movie as the prequel to the next part. So to me it seemed like the studio just split up 1 movie into 2 parts to capitalize on the profits....which they have done well I might add because myself and many other movie goers packed the theater for the 5th Saw installment. So in closing I think this movie may be adequate for the die hard saw fans, not nearly good enough for new comers, and winds up lacking far more than it gives. That is why I can only give this movie a 5 out of 10"

The Brothers Bloom             ,laraemeadows,1,action,2008,8,"The Brothers Bloom unwinds the story of two confidence men, an Asian sidekick and their rich but isolated mark. The Brothers Bloom is a charming off kilter dramedy about love.Bloom (Adrien Brody) and his brother Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) work as confidence men with their explosive sidekick Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi). Tired of the life, Bloom tells his brother he's done. His brother talks him into one final con against Penelope Stamp (Rachael Weisz.) Penelope is a rich, eccentric shut-in who has yet to live. They take advantage of her loneliness in a scam meant to satisfy her need for adventure.Rian Johnson sees the world in The Brothers Bloom the way an archer fish sees bugs. The archer fish hunts bugs above the water's surface by shooting water at the bug from below the water line. When looking up from underneath everything looks like it is one place but actually is in a slightly different place because water refracts light, changing the view for the submerged. The archer fish has to see things slightly cockeyed in order to get the archery right. Rian Johnson took a slightly crooked approach to get the cinematic physics just right.Penelope Stamp is the Robin Hood of cinematic archer fish. Everything about her life, her development, and her emotions are delightfully off balance. She isn't brilliant but she had dedicated herself to learning how to do many strange and obscure things. It wasn't good enough for Rian Johnson to make Penelope interested in pinhole cameras (a camera made by putting a piece of photo paper in a light-tight container and poking a pin hole in it to expose the paper), it had to be a pin hole camera made of a watermelon. Johnson made sure Penelope is beautiful, but by casting Weisz, made her an interesting beauty.It isn't just the nature of the characters, but also how they talk. Johnson commits so fully to this strange-ified world, that dialogue that would warrant a call to the loony bin in real life, seems natural in the world created in The Brothers Bloom.The downside to making the characters fit so naturally in their world is jokes or emotions that might resonate deeply in our world sometimes fall a little flat in The Brothers Bloom. There are no gut busting jokes but occasionally the audience finds themselves chuckling. Cheeks will not be soaked in tears, but occasionally a frog may find way into the throats of the viewers.The Brothers Bloom is an endearing quirk-filled film sure to whisk the audience away on a flying crime filled love carpet."
Surveillance             ,dschmeding,1,crime,2008,5,"""Surveillance"" starts so promising... its a pretty raw movie and from the obscure opening on to the landscape shots, introduction of the characters until the unfolding of the stories begins its interesting while not using any music or effects or whatever. Basically the movie is about a couple of FBI agents who are interrogating three survivors of a bloody crime and trying to find out what happened. The way the story is told through the eyes of the different survivors who all got something to hide and therefore all tell different stories while the real occurrences are shown is really interesting and tense. The characters, especially the twisted corrupt cops, the little girl and the drug-addict are also great and everyone in that backwoods police station where the interrogations take place delivers. Funny thing is... to me the 2 FBI agents are the least interesting although they are the main characters.So the whole story is unfolding, interweaving different points of views and everyone being suspicious, the crime is even shown in a pretty brutal way and the movie has a strange nihilistic feeling to it right until the bleak closing shot. Especially the way how the corrupt cops act out somehow really got to me.But then in its most important part, the final resolution of the story they go for a twist of the most idiotic kind...SPOILER ALERT:The FBI agents are the killers and the whole movie was just a kind of sick mind game. Yeah, pretty smart... problem is that nothing makes any sense at all. You don't get explanations to why they make such a big hassle of interrogating everyone for hours just to kill them in the end and having some strange sexual pleasure of it. Sure, the real FBI agents are found dead in a hotel room and identified by their badges, but how the hell our 2 smartasses identified themselves as FBI agents? How did they learn to set up and operate their interrogation surveillance equipment and why does the little girl only tell her secrets to the most demented people around... first the cops after harassing her family, then the killer who killed her family. No explanation in any of the actions of her or her family. Its just a bad twist turning the whole movie upside down and leaving you with a total mess of a story that looked so promising when you didn't yet know what was happening.Until the last quarter I really liked ""Surveillance"", then i started to hate it. I guess that still makes it a clean average movie..."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,robert-temple-1,1,drama,2009,10,"This film is wonderful, exhilarating, joyful. The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least."
Hancock             ,robinhoodfilms,0,action,2008,1,"How do weak directors land $100+ budgets? The audiences are too stupid to know what weak film-making is. Berg's shaky, hand-held (and shifting focus) style is emblematic of a director walking on to the set with no idea what he's going to shoot. Just keep the cameras moving and try to pass it off as a ""style"". This technique is (over)used in the last few years, especially in action scenes to the point where now, it doesn't seem to matter if you can tell what's happening in a scene as long as you know a lot of 'stuff' is going on. To use this same technique in a boardroom where people are sitting around talking, just pulls you out of the films and asking yourself ""what the hell is THAT about?"" The same lazy, sloppy style was used in ""Constand Gardner"", another film that suffered from for the ignornance of not realizing that this technique can sometimes work in scenes of intense energy, angst or action...but doesn't play in others. If you're thinking about the direction, the director has failed...and Berg failed through most of the movie on this one."
WALL·E             ,DrWetter,0,animation,2008,10,"I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very ""virtual"", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life ""grit."" The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can't wait to see what the future brings... 7"
The Lucky Ones             ,GWilliamLocke,,adventure,2010,5,"The Lucky Ones was a great idea for a film. A road movie about three soldiers on leave, played my Rachel McAdams, Tim Robbins and Michael Pena. When these three soldiers - who are initially strangers - end up on a plane together (and eventually a rental car due to the grounding of planes) they're forced to spend time together, limping and driving across the country, battle scars everywhere.Directed by Neil Burger, known mostly for 2006's decent enough The Illusionist, The Lucky Ones feels like the work of a filmmaker who has ended up far out of his league. He seems to make some good decisions here and there (the film is well cast and the concept is strong), but, for a $14 million dollar film with three great leads, The Lucky Ones is a major disappointment. For starters, cinematographer Declan Quinn (In America, Rachel Getting Married, Leaving Las Vegas, Monsoon Wedding, etc.) doesn't give this film a $14 million dollar look. In fact, after a few scenes I got excited, thinking that this might be a true indie film with a tiny budget. It's not. And, unless Burger paid his stars big bucks, I can't figure out where the $14 million went - there's nothing in this film that should've cost much more than a Joe Swanberg or Andrew Bujalski film.And while that might seem like a petty complaint (seeing as how most movie watchers don't analyze such things), let me also take this opportunity to point out how sad it is to see Burger, who also wrote the film, waste away a great story idea. Three unconnected modern day soldiers end up stuck in a car together, crossing the country? How can you mess that up?! Especially when you have McAdams, Robbins, Pena and Quinn on your team? Burger finds a way.All that said, there are some enjoyable moments in this pedestrian piece of film art. Whenever the trio pass any sort of landmark or tourist trap, McAdams' character begs to stop, the other two denying her. They three all wake up at night with night terrors. We even get to see the endlessly soft-and-sweet McAdams start a fight at a college bar in southern Indiana where she's eventually backed up by her new solider pals. It could've been a classic moment. Unfortunately, it's not memorable and hardly believable, no matter how convincingly muscular McAdams' jaw and shoulders are. Robbins' and Pena's performances are strong throughout and McAdams' face continues to be the best screen face of her time. But, aside from these minor points, The Lucky Ones is a disappointment. Soldiers are, by average, living the most storyteller-worthy lives of any Americans right now, and this is all Berger can come up with? A bar fight and night terrors? Needless to say, this isn't a very deep or thoughtful film. The end - which I'm sure Burger thinks is incredibly thoughtful and unexpected - wraps things up nicely, of course. Don't things always wrap up nicely for soldiers?And the use of music? Ugh. Berger offers a selection of super obvious hipster picks mixed in with a score so cheesy that you have to doubt the vision of the director. F'real; it's that bad. Does the guy who likes this awful score really like all of this great indie music, or is he just trying to be hip? That's the question.I could go on, but why bother. Burger, who with The Illusionist became a director to watch, has become, with The Lucky Ones, a director who is going to have to fight for jobs, stars and production budgets. The classic case of an over-hyped auteur blowing their big brea"
Slumdog Millionaire             ,slseel,0,drama,2008,8,"This is an extraordinary film. From the original concept of the novel on which it is based (Q&A by Vikas Swarup), the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (Full Monty) but especially the masterful creation and direction of the film by Danny Boyle. From the opening moments until the final scene, the audience was fully engaged. I was completely lost in the world that Danny Boyle created. This is not a story that has been told and retold, hashed and rehashed. It is fresh and engaging - all at once quickly moving, romantic, violent, culturally insightful, desperate and slightly fantastic. There are some comic elements to the film but to describe it as a ""comedy"" seems inappropriate. The film was shot on location in India, mostly in Mumbai. Slumdog Millionaire is yet another testament to depth and range of Boyle's artistic talent who has directed such diverse films as Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine.I saw the film on at the 2008 Telluride Film Festival as a ""sneak preview."" The film was introduced by Boyle who said that the official opening of the film would be the next weekend at the Toronto Film Festival. He also said that there may be some final tweaking of the film prior to Toronto.In the discussion after the film Boyle strongly recommended three Indian made films: Satya, Company and Black Friday. He described each as superb. Boyle also stated that a portion of the Slumdog Millionaire was shot with a Canon EOS still camera, especially around the Taj Mahal, rather than a proper movie camera which creates unwanted attention while filming at popular tourist locations in India.8.2 3"
Pathology             ,nunyabiz1973,1,crime,2008,8,"After seeing an advanced screening, this film honestly delivered more than expected. Not being a fan of the gruesome torture-porn films so wide-spread in recent years, nor of the writers previous film (utterly ridiculous, in my opinion), I had reservations going in. Not in regards to the abilities of the cast, but as to how the concept of the film would be handled on the screen. The first 10 minutes, while well done, gave me pause as to whether the filmmakers would get beyond showing how extreme and outrageous they could be to an actually engaging story. In the end, I found the graphic and brutal nature of some of the scenes to support the development of the story and it's well drawn characters as well as the effective exploration of the darker potentials of the human psyche. My final impressions were of the solid performances of the cast and how the film was able to accomplish making the outrageous and often twisted ways of its characters seem both natural and plausible given the context of the story. I highly recommend giving this film a shot, even if it isn't a genre you'd typically see. 1"

It has everything I want in a movie: clearly defined and well-developed characters played by actors - or, in this case, actresses - who know how to deliver carefully modulated and developed performances. The story is about how a young white girl learns to stand on her own feet, but the most interesting parts of the movie are definitely those that develop the various black characters.I never looked at my watch once during this movie, much less went out to refill my popcorn.

I normally don't like these kinds of movies and wouldn't have gone to it if I hadn't known someone who was an extra, but I am so glad I did. Jeff Bridges was so good, I'm having a hard time with him being bald, but it was a good move. My only complaint, was Gwyenth Paltrow.

The Strangers             ,socialretard420,,horror,2008,1,"The worst movie i have seen in a long time, and i just watched Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter The first half hour is kind of humorous, with this guy having the worst day ever, but then the final hour is just the exact same thing over and over There are people with masks, not killing them just to mess with them, and then they run and hide, and the masked people show up again, not harming them, so they run and hide until the completely predictable ""climax"", seeing how its the first thing you see in the movie any attempt to scare you was an overpowering soundtrack and something flashing up on the screen there wasn't suspense, there wasn't terror, there was just tripe "
The Lucky Ones             ,dave-sturm,,adventure,2009,8,"Three soldiers back from Iraq team up and rent a car to drive to their respective destinations. Things happen to them along the way. When they get to their destinations, what they find is not what they expected.That's ""The Lucky Ones"" in a nutshell. But it doesn't do justice to this quirky, touching and funny film.Tim Robbins and Michael Pena give sturdy, soldierly performances, but the real story here is Rachel McAdams, who is mesmerizing as the blunt talking, somewhat naive, wounded (literally, in her thigh), deeply religious, sexually open minded and perpetually optimistic Pvt. Colee Dunn. She is a ray of pure southern sunshine and steals every scene she is in.Some highlights: A furious McAdams throws her soda on Pena when he insults her boyfriend, killed in Iraq, by saying he was unfit to be a soldier because he supposedly did armed robbery.McAdams lashes out in a bar when some valley girl-types mock her limp. ""Good thing I didn't have my weapon,"" she says after.All three end up at an evangelical service and McAdams stands up to testify, blithely telling embarrassing secrets about her companions while they cringe.After locking their keys in the car, they trudge off for help and end up at a Hummer dealership. On the way back in a luxury Hummer, they compare this one with what they're more used to.When McAdams arrives at her dead boyfriend's family, she finds out his colorful depiction of them was somewhat embellished. What she decides to tell them about him is even more embellished to spare their feelings. In fact, this scene is so moving it is probably the highlight of McAdams acting career.Robbins is at a rich man's party and meets a beautiful woman who begins flirting with him. He asks if she's married and she says, ""Umm."" They both start laughing hysterically.This movie has many such moments.One lowlight: A contrived, cheap-looking tornado scene that's just in the movie to give Pena and McAdams a chance to huddle in a drainpipe, allowing a certain delightful discovery to be made. Afterward, the twister has blown the landscape to pieces, but their vehicle is untouched.Final thought: This is not an Iraq movie. This is an America movie."
Igor             ,justin_of_the_dead,0,animation,2008,5,"Igor flip the channel. I'll start off by saying i really wanted to like this movie. I've been looking forward to it for more than 2 months now and I was completely blown away by it's lack of humor and uninspired script. I'm a big fan of John Cusack and he does a good job with the voice acting but honestly there's no shining light to this film. It's the biggest disappointment of the year for me and i strongly suggest anyone hoping to see a fun movie to look elsewhere. It was long, tedious and felt stitched together. The movie isn't funny and may be too complicated for the younguns and is too childish and uninspired for adults. If you like horror comedy with a playful twist i suggest you simply go out and buy Nightmare before Christmas instead. I hope this could help, i wish i would've read a similar review beforehand."
The Burning Plain             ,jaybob,1,misc,2010,8,"Guillermo Arriaga both wrote & directed this dramatic mystery involving 8 persons over two generations.It is a multi-character love story. Since the tale has more depth than we first suspect, It has a tendency to be confusing at time, as scenes go from back & forth from the past to now.. Stay with it as it does have a satisfactory conclusion.There is an explosion in very opening scene,we will find out all about it, the people involved & the reasons it occurred. There is also a pivotal off camera plane crash.Charlize Theron & Kim Basinger are the leads and needless to say both are very well cast. also in cast & are just first rate are. Jennifer Lawrence,Jose Maria Zazak,John Corbett, J.D. Pardo, Danno Pino & Joaquin DeAlemeida.This film is more for adults than youngsters, the only action is the big explosion. There are quite a few nude love scenes all are well handled.Since this is a drama it had a very short few screen run in the US.I am glad I stayed with this to the end.RATINGS: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 1"
Trucker             ,BernardoLima,1,drama,2010,NA,"Diane Ford (Michelle Monaghan), a vivacious and successful independent truck driver, leads a carefree life of long-haul trucking, one night stands and all-night drinking with Runner (Nathan Fillion) until the evening her estranged 11-year-old son, Peter (Jimmy Bennett) is unexpectedly dropped at her door due to his father's recent diagnosis of cancer. Peter hasn't seen his mother since he was a baby and wants to live with Diane as little as she wants him, but they are stuck with each other - at least for now, while his father Len (Benjamin Bratt) is in the hospital. Burdened with this new responsibility and seeing the life of freedom she's fought for now jeopardized, Diane steps reluctantly into her past and looks sidelong at an uncharted future that is not as simple or straightforward as she had once believed possible... Trucker is essentially a character study of this woman, Diane, who's a bit of lone wolf but is forced to change her life and behavior in order to be something she doesn't quite know how to be, a parental figure, a mother. Despite her initial struggle, Diane's maternal instincts do kick in at some point as she gets closer to her son, and she also comes to certain realizations regarding her love life and general lifestyle. Trucker's cinematography is great and the soundtrack (composed mainly by country music) is very fitting. Michelle Monaghan was great as Diane and this was probably the most challenging role of her career so far. With no make up and stripped of most of her femininity, Monaghan really did personified this tough woman, alienated from society who's life has taken a toll from being constantly on the road with no real connection, no real relationships. Nathan Fillion did a good job too, giving a tender and genuine performance. Jimmy Bennett, the kid, was pretty good as well. Overall I enjoyed Trucker but I do think the film lacks a little something, I'm not sure if it's development, or if the film is too predictable but there's something missing here. Obviously, films about small town life are usually not very eventful and that's why Trucker relies so much on the acting and on its cinematography but I think the film needed something more. Having said that, Trucker is a pleasant surprise and a very promising debut by director James Mottern.7/10"
21             ,Critomaton,0,crime,2008,3,"""21"" bets that it can build on the excitement of the book upon which it is based but busts by going over the top.Here's how bad this movie was: ""Jumper"" was more entertaining. 'Nuff said. Need more explanation? OK, here goes but there are lots of spoilers ahead.The movie is based on the book ""Bringing Down The House"" by Ben Mezrich. The book is a quick read with a detailed and captivating explanation about how a group of college students, led by their professor, beat the system in Blackjack using knowledge of statistics, memorization techniques, and teamwork. That is, they had a really successful system for counting cards. I found the book compelling.However, as I read it, I realized it wouldn't translate well into a movie because there just wasn't a lot of action in the traditional sense and it didn't have a ""Hollywood"" ending; the card-counting team just kind of fell apart and each member went his or her own way. So I was very curious to see how the filmmakers would try to jazz up the story.Here's the irony: They embellished the story significantly and still managed to produce a tedious, predictable movie that didn't do justice to the characters, setting or tone of the book. I recommend reading the book and skipping the movie.Here are some of the differences I remember between the movie and the book. Caveat: my memory might be a bit fuzzy here - I read the book a few months ago. In the movie, there is a scene where a jealous card-counting teammate practically rats out his buddy at the Blackjack table, likening him to the Dustin Hoffman character from Rain Man. This scene is awkward and unbelievable and a far cry from anything in the book. In the book, the tension and dynamics between the teammates were much more subtle, but I guess subtle doesn't work on the big screen.Apparently, the inexplicable popularity of ""Superbad"" means there now has to be an incredibly nerdy, weight-challenged, wannabe stand-up comedian in every major studio release. That's a shame. He wasn't funny in ""Superbad"" and he wasn't funny in ""21"" (yeah, I know it's not the same actor). Nothing against the weight-challenged, just the blatantly unfunny. You know a screenplay is weak when the big confrontation between the college student with the double life and his techno-geek buddies occurs because he puts an 8K chip in their science project instead of a 16K chip. Who writes this stuff? I don't remember the ""Ben abandons his nerd buddies"" subplot being in the book, but I could be wrong about that. It's pretty trite regardless. In the book, the team kind of just falls apart, primarily as a result of too many close calls with casino staff and a particular loss prevention specialist. The team also corrodes from within due to jealousy, disillusionment from a few big losses, and resentment that the organizing professor doesn't seem to be taking any of the risk while collecting his reward. Some of the money gets stolen but they're never sure who did it and so the team just kind of dissolves. They try to regroup in various configurations but it doesn't last. Financially, everybody still makes out reasonably well in the end.In the movie, Ben gets beaten up by the loss prevention consultant (played by Laurence Fishburne), gets all of his money stolen by his professor (played by Kevin Spacey), exacts revenge on the thief by improbably teaming up with LF (who has a personal vendetta against KS), then loses it all again to LF's five-finger pension plan and six-shot revolver. But don't worry, he'll probably get a scholarship to Harvard by wowing the administrator with tales of his wild experiences. I haven't seen a college administrator that wowed by irresponsible behavior since Richard Masur in ""Risky Business"" (and he had a much better reason). Then again, I guess it's not much different than scoring big by writing a book about it, which actually did happen.So far, you might be thinking the movie sounds a lot more exciting than the book and I'd have to agree. But somehow it still manages to fall flat on screen. The book emphasized the team's use of disguises and alternate personalities very well. This was an element of the movie, to be sure, but it seemed very underdeveloped and I was surprised how much more entertaining it was on the printed page than the big screen. Same thing with the initiation scene, Ben's transformation into a ""player"", his enjoyment of the Vegas VIP life, etc. In the book, the pursuit by the loss prevention consultant was much more dogged. It wasn't confined to just one or two casinos but went nationwide. The film really didn't capture the determination of the pursuit very well or the number of casinos the team hit.I could go on and on but, thankfully, IMDb's word limit won't let me. So I'll just mention a few bad things about the movie that have nothing to do with it being based on a book: 1) At 2 hours long, the movie seems very drawn out given its rather shallow treatment of the subject matter. 2) Kevin Spacey seems to have a trademark style. It is menacing yet monotonous - as contrasted with Jack Nicholson's style of menacing and maniacal. Jack's style usually works, sometimes in spite of itself. Kevin's style doesn't seem to be producing memorable performances lately. He's made some great movies, to be sure, but after ""21"" and ""Superman Returns"" I'd say he's officially due for a comeback. Many movies that have strayed from their literary inspirations have been entertaining and worthy in their own right. ""21"" is most definitely not one of those movies."
Gran Torino             ,woljm45,0,drama,2008,10,"With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"". Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you'll love this movie!! 3"
Death Race             ,ccthemovieman-1,0,action,2009,8,"Regardless of the politically-correct finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes, this was a fun film to watch simply because it entertained. It was a good diversion, filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosterone-gone-wild. In other words, this was a typical Jason Statham film. No matter how many of these ultra-macho men he plays, he gets away with it with charm and likability.In this story, Statham as ""Jensen Ames"" is like David battling Goliath but with no slingshot and Goliath having a flame thrower and AK-47, too. Yet, you just know ""David"" will a find to defy all odds! Here are some movie clichés of today. See if they sound familiar.Not only has our hero suffer with his beautiful and loving wife murdered, but he's framed for the kill. Sent a brutal prison, he finds the female warden is responsible, and the killer of his wife also is in the jail. Too add salt to the wounds, that guy taunts ""Jensen."" Filmmakers haven't made a nice-guy warden since the 1950. Here, the sadistic boss is a woman: ""Hennessey,"" played by Joan Allen, who I thought had some class before I saw this film. Spewing the f-word, ""coc-sucker"" and a few other choice words, sort of ruined that image I had of her.Anyway, the mean old warden got our hero in prison there so he can be the new ""Frankenstein"" race driver. The races at her prison, it turns out, are filmed live and are big internet moneymakers for her. ""Frankenstein"" is the favorite driver of the computer-audience but he's too injured to go on, so ""Hennessey"" recruits Mr. Ames, whom she knows is a great driver.Mostly there are nothing but bad folks in here and a lot of ultra-violent scenes, one-after-the-other. You also have other cliché prison characters, the kind you see in all prison films since ""The Longest Yard."" Beware of jiggling hand-held camera scenes, if that kind of thing gives you a headache.Having said all that, I admit the film is interesting start-to-finish, the racing scenes terrific, the film effectively manipulative, and overall qualifies as a decent means of entertainment. Statham is the new Steve Seagal, Jean-Claude VanDamme, etc - but that's okay; some of their movies were fun to watch, too."
Pathology             ,ChuckTurner,1,crime,2008,1,"Pathology might have been an interesting movie if they hadn't evidently chopped out much of the exposition.Milo Ventimiglia arrives as intern at NY city pathologists office, discovering all but one of his fellow interns are psychos, bullies and junkies. Understandably, he doesn't want anything to do with them. Then, suddenly, he's joined the gang, and is vying with their chief psycho to out-gross them all, while conducting a steamy affair with a woman in whom he has previously shown no interest whatsoever.It's like the producers thought they'd just like to get to the sex and blood, and the subject matter and story were getting in the way. They've made a film that purports to explore the further shores of moral jeopardy, but actually hasn't the faintest idea of its own ethical parameters.What is really morally objectionable is that MGM has released a film that makes no sense, has no proper starting point or conclusion, and yet they expect Moviegoers to pay full rate to see this damaged, unfinished, witless and cynical mess."
Julia             ,doclee32,1,crime,2010,9,"Just watched this film on TV and love it. Tilda Swinton's acting is extremely good here. Most actresses tend to over-act in such a role but Tilda's acting is just perfect. The story line is good, fast moving and interesting. Good directing also judging from the high acting standard as a whole here. Surprised that this movie did not win any other awards other than the British. The movie happened in United States and Mexico and good choice of filming sites. Only thing I can suggest is to have a more dynamic tittle for the film. I have not watched this film until now because I was not aware it was going to be such a nice thriller type of fil"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,joestank15,1,comedy,2008,8,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall - A slacker composer Peter (Jason Segel from ""Knocked Up"") has a breakdown after his girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell of ""Heroes""), the star of a hit TV show, dumps him for a British pop star. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and forget about Sarah, which proves to be a poor choice when he finds Sarah is not only in Hawaii, but they are staying at the same hotel. Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill and Mila Kunis co-star.This was a funny movie! It's a more mature than your average comedy. It survives comedically without leeching off too many other bits of pop culture, unlike Knocked Up. There is the exception of some funny spoofs of CSI and Ghost Whisperer, two fatted calfs rip for killing. Everyone is allowed to be funny, even the women, and they are. I enjoyed the occasional ""Scrubs"" style cut-aways which were frequently funny. The best one has to be the week Peter spent in the same pair of sweat pants.This was a lucky stroke from from first time director Nicholas Stoller and first time writer (in addition to lead actor) Jason Segel. I hate making comparisons to other actors, but I kept thinking of Judge Reinhold when I saw Segel. Not that that's a strike against him.Segel is a fresh face in the comedy genre, and is adept at playing sympathetic slacker and funny man in one. Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes, and it's a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone, even Sarah Marshall, seems like a 3-dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), who is the rival to Peter, is likable. There's no animosity between the two men. It's nice to have a comedy where we don't have to demonize anyone.It's a cute film, sometimes hilarious, but the first half is definitely funnier than the second half. I might pick it up on DVD sometime.B+"
The Square             ,Aristides-2,0,crime,2010,4,"When the dog got killed I laughed, soft-hearted dog lover that I am, because the Dog was standing in for the Square. (And what a dog! Able to race through neighborhoods, swim a river and then run through yet another neighborhood to find his cutie!) Come to think of it, the two owners of the dogs, in the opening sequence, while hooking up, had both dogs in the same car. Maybe the director's cut will open on the two dogs having a go of it and then pan over to Ray and Carla getting it on. But seriously..... By not showing a compelling reason, other than sex, in even one scene, I had increasing difficulty over Ray's willingness to dump everything for the sake of his sex mate. And jumping to the end of the movie, after a badly staged scene of Carla getting killed.....and the camera-on-a-crane showing a disconsolate and bloody Ray walking down the street away from the carnage, one is supposed to say 'tsk-tsk' poor guy. But I didn't have any sympathy for either Carla or Ray at that point. How do you sympathize with characters who have little character and who you don't like?Other more technical annoyances were a couple of impenetrable accents and also poor casting choices which made it confusing to know who was who.Why did Lenny steal the generator? And what did he have on Ray?It also wasn't enough to kill, in a road accident, the suspicious foreman but the writers had to also place an infant in the vehicle.After a break in, wouldn't the obvious thing to happen, with all the materials lying around, be the hiring of a security guard?And pray tell how did the boss-of-bosses and the law know about the blackmailing? More important, how were they going to resolve the serious breach of the law that they were involved in?There really were more silly things gathering along the way but you get the idea..."
The Lucky Ones             ,tieman64,,adventure,2012,NA,"Written and directed by Neil Burger, ""The Lucky Ones"" tells the story of three United States Army soldiers who return from the 2003 US invasion of Iraq to embark on an unplanned road trip across the United States. The film is a fairly faithful update of William Wyler's ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and Hal Ashby's ""The Last Detail"", though Burger claims never to have seen the former film.Like Wyler's film, which was also ironically titled, ""The Lucky Ones"" centres on three servicemen of different social strata, rank and age. There's Sgt Cheaver (Tim Robbins), who's wrestling with a divorce and financial problems, Pvt Colee Dunn (Rachel McAdams), who's struggling to cope with a wounded leg, poverty and isolation, and Sgt Poole (Michael Pena), whose sex organs have been severely damaged by a piece of shrapnel.There's a lot of good stuff in the film. Burger's direction is gentle, easygoing and relaxed, our trio of characters are both likable and pleasantly low-key, the gang's road trip is immensely fun and the film features a number of fine conversations. Unfortunately ""The Lucky Ones"" also contains a number of absolutely god-awful scenes which totally kill the picture. Such heavy handed atrocities  scenes which would embarrass most writers - include a sudden marital break-up, an out-of-nowhere argument over a locked car, a ridiculous car crash and a LITERAL TORNADO ATTACK. Half this movie is a masterpiece of low key observation, the other half is an embarrassment. What's going on?Still, mentally filter out these terrible moments and the film has a lot to recommend. Burger positions us to sympathise with these soldiers, shows how the army exploits minorities and the marginalised, how each of these characters has absolutely no place to go, no one to take them in but the Armed Forces, how the military engenders dependency, how enlistees treat income and institutional connection as a bigger priority than the larger ethical and political ramifications of War, how the Army neuters ideological conflict (within its staff), how civilians (on either end of the political spectrum) condescendingly treat soldiers, how the military experience is completely divorced from the every-day reality of most Americans, how soldiers oft return home to a kind of soft segregation, how the soldiering class is almost a class unto itself, often unable to mingle comfortably with others, how the army compensates for weak egos and becomes an almost cultic figure for the disenfranchised etc etc. This is an unusually perceptive film. But a frustrating one too, because for every good sequence there's an abomination which makes you want to gouge your eyes out.7.9/10  Frustratin"
The Ruins             ,Arenarocker05,,adventure,2008,7,"Could this be the best horror film so far this year? Well when you take a look at some of the horror films we see today like ""The Eye"", ""Prom Night"", ""Shutter"", and ""One Missed Call"", it damn well could be. Because lets face it; those movies I just listed flat-out sucked and I didn't even have to see them to find out for myself. However, this movie on the other hand delivers a couple of scares and some intensely disturbing images that will make you look the other way.The film focuses on four college students who are on a vacation in Mexico and then suddenly they meet a stranger who invites them to a place that is not even on the map, (So far there is already a typical horror cliché). Anyway, they go to a sight where an ancient Mayan Temple stands, hopping to find the stranger's brother who was missing somewhere among the ruins. Afterwards bizarre events begin to happen and the only thing left for these unsuspected individuals is to survive.In my opinion, this film is good for its genre. It does follow some patterns on how to make a successful horror movie. The acting is decent and the characters do a nice job holding it together, rather than just falling apart all at once. Now I don't know how accurate this is to the book because I never read it but I'm sure the book is just as graphic as the movie, maybe worse. So to rap it up, if your looking to avoid a bad remake of an original horror piece or some Japanese film turned upside down, give this film a shot. It's not the best horror film I've seen, but its worth the rent."
Deception             ,claudio_carvalho,0,crime,2009,4,"In Manhattan, the shy auditor Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor) befriends the lawyer Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman) in the office where he is working. While having lunch together, they accidentally swap their cell phones and Wyatt travels to London. Jonathan receives a phone call from a woman scheduling a meeting in a hotel, and sooner he finds that Wyatt is member of a sex club called The List where he has one night stand with successful businesswomen. Among the rules, the participants should stay anonymous to the partner. Jonathan joins The List and when he dates a woman that he had previously met in the subway whose name begins with the letter ""S"" (Michelle Williams), he falls in love for her. They schedule a next encounter in Chinatown, and S is kidnapped from their room in the hotel. Jonathan seeks the police, but without any information about S, he can not report a missing person. When Wyatt returns from London, Jonathan discovers that he is trapped in a dirty scheme of slush money. When I saw the trailer of ""Deception"", I truly believed that it could be a great movie. However, the movie is a complete deception, with a predictable and unrealistic story full of clichés and stupid plot holes. For example, how could a man with the profile of Jonathan smoke pot with a stranger in the office where he is working? And later, while chasing Wyatt, why should he tell to a secretary that he had smoked marijuana with Wyatt in the meeting room? How could Wyatt so easily circulate in an office and in a fancy building in Manhattan without having problem with the security guards or the porter? Why should Jonathan leave twenty million dollars in the Spanish park after having his life destroyed? How easy is to make an American passport and travel with the name of a dead man? I could list many other holes in the story, like the scene of the explosion of the apartment. Further, the predictable twist with the appearance of Jonathan is simply terrible and the corny and awful conclusion shows that love is beautiful. In the end, the only thing that works perfectly in this story is its tile that summarizes my feeling for the whole movie. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""A Lista"" (""The List"")"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,johnstonjames,1,drama,2010,8,"Wow. This was a really good movie. The only reason why I didn't give it ten stars is because I reserve ten stars for the movies I really, really love and am a fan of, and nine stars for something I think is pretty much best picture material. I can't say I felt that way about the film, but I still thought it was excellent and very worthwhile.The acting here is incredible. The women were intense and thoughtful, and it's always good to see these fine actress in almost anything, especially something this good. I've always thought Dakota Fanning was a superb actress for a juvenile, and this film really suits her acting talent,(far better than the flat, one-dimensional tween sci-fi dud 'Push')This film is basically a women's film, but gender should not bias the viewer. It's great entertainment with important, timeless messages about human rights and respect. this movie should be seen by everyone, especially young peopl"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,claudio_carvalho,1,misc,2008,7,"Carmen Lowell (America Ferrera) is working on the backstage of a play in Yale.

However she finds that Lena Kaligaris (Alexis Bledel) will travel to a course of drawing. Bridget Vreeland (Blake Lively) is in existential crisis missing her mother and decides to travel to an archaeological dig in Turkey. Tibby Tomko-Rollins (Amber Tamblyn) is working in a rental and still editing her documentary. Therefore, Carmen accepts the invitation and travels to Vermont. She has a crush on the lead actor Ian (Tom Wisdom), who convinces her to participate in an audition, and is invited by the director Bill Kerr (Kyle MacLachlan) to perform the lead female role. Later she finds the truth about the friendship of Julia. The broken-hearted Lena finds that Kostas (Michael Rady) has married and she dates the model of her class. Bridget finds letters addressed to her from her grandmother that her father has hidden and she decides to visit her grandma, disclosing a secret about her mother. Tibby makes love with her boy-friend Brian McBrian (Leonardo Nam) but they have problems with the condom and she gets scared of a possible pregnancy. In the end, the girlfriends discover that their friendship is real and more than a pair of jeans.I have watched this sequel during a flight without watching ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" and I liked the story in spite of not being familiarized with the characters. The story about friendship and discoveries is a sort of teen version of ""Sex and the City"", with four young women that belong to different ethnic groups and backgrounds, but have also a solid friendship that help each other in the bad moments and celebrate together the good ones. The four subplots entwined by an apparently magic pair of jeans are good, but Carmen's one is certainly the more engaging. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
Bolt             ,shizznick85,0,animation,2008,10,"This movie was enjoyable all around. I saw a special screening last tuesday and it was great. I found that kids felt they were intwined with in the movie. It made you feel like you were right there helping out Bolt and his friends. The character traits and development were well done. From the pigeons of New York to the pigeons in California every character had their own special personality. The graphics were superb and it made you feel as if the movie was real. John Travolta does the voice of Bolt. I wasn't sure if at first he was a good choice, but he made Bolt his own. Miley Cyrus was really good as the voice of Penny. She did well and her timing was great, but the real character that made this movie was Rhino the Hamster. He steals every scene and you and your kids will be quoting his lines for weeks to come. I saw take your kids to see this and don't worry it is great for adults too."
The Strangers             ,jaddison383,,horror,2008,7,"We all know the plot: young couple, isolated vacation home, people in masks. Yet from the start of 'The Strangers' it's clear that this film is a different. In today's bloodthirsty society, horror films are often reduced to nothing more than gore-filled gross-out fests. While many young teens may rejoice at such films, many of us still long for original, suspenseful, and, yes, terrifying horror movies. 'The Strangers' came so close.There is plenty here to recommend: Director Bryan Bertino shows himself to be a patient and smart director. Rather than going for just cheap thrills, he wisely builds tension up to near-breaking point. The feeling of suspense and dread that covers the whole film is classic. Both Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman do well in their leading roles, and the strangers themselves are things of pure terror... yet that's where the film loses some of its commendation. The strangers at times seem that they can't possibly be human because they are made to be almost supernatural in their abilities. They appear and disappear seemingly at will and instantly- a power the young couple probably wished they had but don't because they are, after all, HUMANS. It's a simple mistake used to give the audience one of those cheap thrills that were otherwise so wisely avoided. What makes it sad is that in every other aspect, 'The Strangers' is chillingly realistic and terrifyingly possible. Every time those strangers come and go like ghosts of some kind, it makes the audience sit back once more and say, 'Ah, well, it's just a movie."" That's too bad.Still, 'The Strangers' is much better than your average horror fare. It's at last a new movie that realizes what you don't show can be even more scary than what you do. Still, one hopes that Mr. Bertino can touch up the mistakes from this film and , and deliver a really great horror movie next time around. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison 1"
The Merry Gentleman             ,in1984,,crime,2009,3,"... it had the potential to work. Combine it with an actor who apparently wants to make one of those films you can tell is specifically created for Oscar award nomination and ends up being cliché and simplistic and you get cliché, simplistic, and unrealistic.At times it did work. But I think this is a case where the director (also a primary actor in the story) got himself too involved and lost perspective.You could also say this mixes the various sniper/killer films popular at the moment with an xmas film. Either way, the end product would have benefited immensely from someone reviewing it who wasn't personally involved in the film and a bit more plot development"
Kung Fu Panda             ,da_flipboy,0,animation,2008,10,"After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.Now the good... or rather great. While classic kung fu movies are poked fun at, Kung Fu Panda does an excellent job of treating the genre with great respect in a movie geared towards kids. And while it IS kid friendly, it is not dumbed down to the point where it's childish. All the classic elements of those great kung fu flicks are there, while still keeping it pleasantly G-rated.Let me get this out of the way: this movie has some of the greatest 3D animated fight scenes. Ever. What elevates them from good to great is that while I expected the unbelievable, gravity-defying stunts that are REQUIRED of a good kung fu movie, there is an amazing amount of 'realism' to the physics in this movie. Just watch the jailbreak and you'll understand.Speaking of animation, the cinematography, character design and backgrounds are all done very, very well. Whether it's flying through the air alongside a leaping character, the painting-like backgrounds, or the wonderful opening sequence (reminiscent of Samurai Jack), they're all beautiful. Snap zooms, slow-motion, and flying cameras are also used with great skill to further the experience.Even the music and sound is outstanding. Asian drums rumble in the background of intense fights... stones shatter and crumble away... fight sequences rise and fall with each of the music cues, or is that the other way around? Beautiful.What helps make this a new classic in my eyes is what it doesn't have. There are no Matrix, Spiderman, or other dated references. There are no inside jokes related to the voice actors. There isn't even any double entendre or unnecessary crude humour. Much like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Monsters Inc"", there's just plenty of pop-culture-free goodness that is terribly entertaining.The last great part of this movie is often the most overlooked part of a good family film... heart. This movie has oodles of it. Other movies have tried to have a lesson in the end like 'be yourself' (""Shrek""), or 'the value of friends' (""Madagascar""), or... 'be yourself' (""Shark Tale""), but ""Kung Fu Panda"" has genuine cinematic moments with dialogue that carries real weight. Best line: Oogway regarding yesterday, tomorrow and today.So, finally, as a complete sucker for Pixar animation, I'm glad that another animation company can actually put proper thought and execution into a FAMILY movie. What else can I say? Congratulations Dreamworks. 10 out of 10. 1"
Frozen River             ,jonathankamiel,1,crime,2009,4,"One of those ""indie"" films that receives a multitude of accolades and great reviews from the taste-makers but fails to deliver. The 4 votes I gave were solely for Melissa Leo's performance which prevented me from pressing the ""open"" button on the remote. I don't even have much to say about the story but it felt like I was experiencing events in real time. I have to write another few lines in order to get my comments submitted. I just want to warn all those people who are in the DVD shop or online and see DVD covers with lots of great reviews and prizes from obscure and not such obscure Film Festivals that these are not always great indicators of a good movie. I just watched ""Crank 2"". It wasn't nominated for the Sundance Film Festival but it was the best hour and a half of entertainment I could have wished for"
Quarantine             ,tigerkatluda1003,1,horror,2008,1,"Already in the Quarntine commercials, they've put the last 5 seconds of the ending and the most scariest part of the film, so I already knew this wasn't going to be good. And yes, I've already seen REC (The Spanish original) I watched Quarntine anyways, for I hope Americans can actually pull of a good remake one day, and nope, it hasn't been done with this film.There are 3 main disappointments in this film, excluding the fact that it was a poor remake.1. No story- what I hated most is that they completely took out the story on the whole situation. It is at the end when they are suppose to realize what was happening to them, but they just ignored it. Therefore, the movie ends without knowing what caused the infection and what was in the final room, especially for those who have not seen the original.2. No characters- One of the strongest factors of REC was their ability to let the viewers know each and every one of the people in the building. You knew their names, their family, their basic backgrounds and personality, and you knew the ones end up infected. In Quarntine, you wouldn't know who is who, who just fell down the stairs, and the only names I remember are the reporter, cameraman, and the little girl.3. No Scare- Throughout the whole movie, i did not once jump or get even the slightest scare. Mainly I know the story before I watched, but Quarntine changed it up quite a bit in scare tactics, but it still didn't work. They also decide to have it extra dark throughout the movie, yet in REC, the rooms were lite and the atmosphere was still scary.Even knowing the whole story, Quarntine left me confused in many parts; the camera was everywhere. I would of liked it if they included an Asian family as they did in REC; no idea why excluded this race. Since I've ranted about all its negative, the only thing i find positive in the film is the better make up artists than REC.I believe no one should pay to see this movie and watching the original (REC) is worth it. But if you're too stubborn to not watch a foreign film with subtitles, then by all means stick with this scare-less, story-less, and character-less movie"
The Brothers Bloom             ,bburns,1,action,2009,5,"There is a very good reason why most art-house fare is drama. For a comedy to be successful, the people involved have to be willing to let their hair down and be silly. But the people who make art-house movies take themselves and their films quite seriously. As a result, when art-house filmmakers try their hands at comedy, we get god-awful pretentiousness and instead of actual jokes we get quirky characters taken straight from ""New Yorker"" cartoons with dialog full of obscure literary allusions. I have only seen six movies that have succeeded in being highbrow art films without sacrificing funniness (""Love and Death"", ""Slacker"", ""Barton Fink"", ""Henry Fool"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Stranger Than Fiction"") and all of them poke fun at their own pomposity. Plus Woody Allen, the Coens, and Charlie Kaufmann all started out doing straight comedy and only got into the art-house stuff later in their careers, so they already knew from funny.""The Brothers Bloom"" is not a successful art-house comedy. I realized it from the opening sequence with third person narration from Ricky Jay. We meet the two brothers as kids in an upscale small town. While the rest of the kids dress normally, the brothers have Beatle cuts, wear dark suits and wear hats that went out of style in the 1930's. The narration reveals writer-director Rian Johnson's ax to grind when it sneers at the ""happy, well-adjusted, stable playground bourgeoisie"" (God forbid anyone be middle-class *and* happy!). Older brother Stephen gets revenge on the local kids (and sets up younger brother Bloom's unwanted ability to seduce any woman he talks to) by constructing an elaborate con that gets all the kids' clothes dirty and earns the brothers $30.Fast-forward 25 years. The Beatle cuts and third person narration are gone, but the brothers--now in their middle 30's--still wear dark suits and old-fashioned hats. Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) is still constructing elaborate cons that also function as great literature (pretentious, no?) with Bloom (Adrien Brody) and mute Japanese munitions expert ""Bang Bang"" (Rinko Kikuchi). Bloom wants out because the cons invariably lead to women throwing themselves at him, which he is extremely uncomfortable with. Eventually he gets up the courage to split for Montenegro and leave the con game behind. But Stephen tracks him down and gets him to agree to the hackneyed One Last Job on a sheltered heiress (Rachel Weisz) who is fluent in multiple languages, can play any musical instrument, and makes homemade cameras all because she was never able to leave her house until both parents died when she was already past 30.The rest of the movie doesn't make any sense. This could be forgiven if the film was actually funny. And since all four leads are good enough actors that they have been Oscar winners or Oscar nominees, they do their best with the material they're given. But the funniest moment is when Stephen quips ""I'm not sure he's really Belgian."" The rest of it is silly hats, quirks, and pointless explosions. And at 113 minutes, it's at least 20 minutes too long for a comedy with no jokes.The Marx Brothers' movies for Paramount and the Monty Python films prove that you can make a laugh-out-loud comedy that's also intelligent. And Woody Allen and Wes Anderson have proved you can also add melancholy and a sophisticated film-making style without sacrificing laughs. But ""The Brothers Bloom"" falls into the same trap as ""Box of Moonlight"", ""Love and Death on Long Island"", ""I Heart Huckabees"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"": the screenwriters and/or directors are unwilling to do anything that keeps their movie from being taken seriously, which defeats the whole purpose of making a comedy. 5 out of 10."
Pride and Glory             ,Quinoa1984,,crime,2008,6,"Interesting to see the reactions to Pride and Glory on IMDb: some people like it a lot, so much so that they rank it as one of their favorite films of the year, while others rank it low, very low, saying it's low-end predictable trash that rips off from every other cop movie around including last year's We Own the Night (that title comes up often, which I can't comment on as I've yet to see it). I might be one of those small handful that are in the middle: Pride and Glory is an alright cop drama, not amazing or really terrible. It borrows from many movies and TV shows, this much is definite, and its directorial style goes between fine competence with actual dialog scenes (with the occasional noir-ish flourish) and overbearing with the hand-held in action scenes. It seems as if no cop drama in recent memory can quite come up to the height that Narc reached with that- coincidentally in this case Narc director Carnahan had a part in writing P&G's script- and for most of the running time the film suffers from a lack of real stylistic vigor.But, thankfully a big but, the performances are all stellar all-around. From the big players like Edward Norton (who, unless under duress or restraint by the studio, turns in fantastic work that's subtle for the camera but as intense as a theater performance) and Colin Farrell (gaining cred fast this year with this, In Bruges and underrated Cassandra's Dream), Jon Voight (who, somehow, has bounced back from the STP-nightmare appearance in Bratz), and character actor Noah Emmerich (often with one facial expression- tension and an inner sadness- but still good if not as good as Little Children), to Jennifer Ehle who plays Emmerich's dying wife who is, for every moment she's on screen, absolutely terrific and even makes great scenes out of otherwise OK elements.This is, in fact, a real actor's movie, unlike Righteous Kill which rested entirely on he heels of its two stars, and for all the black-and-white-and-sometimes-gray areas of the script- about a family of cops who become embroiled in one member, Jimmy (Farrell) and his incredulously corrupt dealings and murders- the bulk of the cast make it more than watchable: one is almost fooled from time to time, with all its rampant cursing and crazy bits (i.e. threatening hot-iron on a baby), that it is great. But it isn't. So much of its plot is middling and only sparks of fascinating scenes keep it together, like when a sleazy Hispanic character pays a personal call to Jimmy's house while his family is home, and its final 15 minutes are a mix of wild hysterics (a supporting character, part of Jimmy's corrupt crew, snaps in a convenience store during a 'pick-up' and a big race-inspired protest happens on cue) and a true-blue Irish bar fight that perhaps would've benefited from John Ford rising from the grave to guest direct.So catch it on TV, now that it's almost gone from theaters, if you haven't seen it yet, and judge for yourself if it's high, low, or in the middle of expectations. I'm in the middle, though it does seem like the kind of OK movie that may play better on repeat viewings when nothing much else is on. 6.5/10"
Stop-Loss             ,countvonbarron,0,drama,2008,NA,"I'm a sergeant in the army and have served 2 tours in Iraq and am preparing to go a third time in December. This film was irresponsible and not balanced in it's portrayal. First off every single soldier has an 8 year commitment. However long your initial enlistment is (3,4 years etc) you then serve the remainder of your time as part of the IRR (indivdual ready reserve). Moreover every single soldier knows about stop loss. It wouldn't have been portrayed the way it was in the movie. He would have known about it ahead of time. They don't tell you the day you get out and make it a surprise. Especially as an E6 a staff sergeant. The combat scene was not realistic. Soldiers guarding a checkpoint WOULD NEVER leave it to chase a vehicle. That is general order no 1 every soldier is taught that from day 1 of basic training. Furthermore the portrayal of PTSD was not wholly accurate. The army has programs in place to treat it. The character played by Joseph Gordon Levitt would not have gotten a bad conduct discharge for breaking a window. He would have received punishment under the uniform code of military justice. For a bad conduct discharge there would have to be a pattern of behavior over a period of time and then every effort would be made to rehabilitate that soldier. The discharge would only come after that had occurred. Finally the scenes of the authorities chasing Ryan Phillipe is BS. The army does not pursue you if you go AWOl. For short awols the soldiers usually receive punishment under UCMJ. For long awols over 30 days the army drops them from the rolls and stops their pay and benefits. If you attempt to get a federal job your name is entered into a database as a deserter. Lastly the final scene is total nonsense. Assuming he was awol less than 30 days he would have been demoted at least 1 grade. He would not have kept his current rank. The soldier was portrayed as a coward. Bottom line. I know personally soldiers in my unit 1 in my squad who have been stop lossed and although they may complain EVERY one of them will do their duty honorably. This movie claims to be pro soldier but it does not portray our soldiers in an honest way and that is dishonoring the memory of all of our soldiers both alive and dead who have served and are still serving over there. Also in response to adx2-1's comment he is right about the policy. 90 days before deployment and 90 days after the unit returns to home station. And under the current dwell time policy it would have been at least a year before he returned. Although it is never stated how long it is suggested that it is less than a year. 1"
Slumdog Millionaire             ,vince_cadena,0,drama,2008,10,"Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since I saw Shallow Grave, since then he's gone on to make three masterpieces(Trainspotting,28 Days Later and Millions), a near perfect film(Sunshine) a guilty pleasure(The Beach) and a total miss(A Life Less Ordinary). Slumdog Millionaire comes out of nowhere and it could very well be his best film and one of the best films of the decade. Visually like Boyles previous work it's stunning, Apocalypse Now and City of God come to mind and there are dutch angles galore. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while. This film needs a Sound Oscar nomination, it sounds that good. I went into seeing this knowing very little about it and the person I took with me didn't know anything about it, so I'll just say it's about a young man that goes on Indias Who Wants to be a Millionaire, it's a very unconventional film where they tell the story of his life in flashbacks while he plays the game. It's funny, sad, thrilling, basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations. Also the lead actress is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, if she isn't a huge star after this I'd be extremely surprised. If the academy doesn't honor this film with numerous nominations it will be a shame but this film will be studied in 20 years and whoever sees this will love it, so even if it doesn't get a single nomination it won't matter. Don't miss this film, it's perfect! 3"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,Chrysanthepop,0,drama,2009,NA,"Dennis Lee adapts Frost's poem with the same title. With such a big names associated with it, I wonder why 'Fireflies in the Garden' never got a US theatrical release. It is a well executed film. Danny Moder's cinematography is breathtaking and Javier Navarrete's score is superb. The story has an interesting premise but it needed fleshing out. It looks patchy at times. The casting is also a little awkward. Emily Watson and Hayden Panettiere are too different to play the same character convincingly and this was difficult for me to overlook. That said, Panettiere was quite decent and Watson is first rate but she deserved more screen time (and her character, the older Jane, needed more fleshing out). Ditto for Julia Roberts who, despite of a small role, has a strong presence throughout the entire film. I find her character's actions questionable. For example why does she choose to leave her husband when he cheats on her while all those years she stays with him when he's abusing their son? Ryan Reynolds shows growth as an actor. He displayed maturity in 'Definitely, Maybe' and seems to be going the right way as an actor. Willem Dafoe too does a terrific job from being the hateful father to being the softer old man but I would have liked to see more of the transformation in Charles because on the one hand he is shown to be a loving father (as shown in the home video) but on the other hand he doesn't seem to have changed much (the scene in the car when they're on their way to visit Jane and his temper at the dinner table). The director could have shown more of Lisa and Charles during their later years. I also liked Cayden Boyd's performance. Ioan Gruffudd and Carrie-Anne Moss do not have more than a couple of scenes. 'Fireflies in the Garden' seems like a well intentioned movie but it appears too rushed and patchy to fully involve the viewer. It needed more than 95 minutes of screen time. The visuals, soundtrack and performances make it a decent watch."
WALL·E             ,stibjork,0,animation,2008,NA,"WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to clean it up while the human race waits in space. Despite being a robot, however, WALL-E has developed a consciousness - he is curious and innocent as a child. Of course, being what seems like the only operational robot left, he also longs for companionship (...someone besides his pet cockroach).That's where EVE comes in, a robot probe sent from the humans in space to check whether or not Earth is again inhabitable. Once WALL-E sees EVE, he becomes smitten and will literally follower her anywhere on Earth... or even space.One can empathize with WALL-E, as he has been alone for what seems like the greater part of 700 years, toiling away at work with nothing but the comforts of his makeshift home to give him some small pleasures and distractions in life (although his morning sluggishness is due to his depleted power, we can't help but relate with those mornings WALL-E finds hard to get out of bed). When he sees the sleek, powerful EVE, it's quite understandable that he is captivated by her.EVE, on the other hand, is completely focused on work (her ""directive""). While we can see her personality come through when she enjoys the freedom of flying around upon her arrival, she is determined to fulfill her mission.The real love story starts to kick in here. The scenes of WALL-E trying to gain EVE's affection are both lovable and laughable. And when WALL-E brings EVE to his home to shelter the storm, he shows EVE all of the various things he collected, much like how a child would show another companion his playthings. EVE's sense of humor comes to light, and we start to see a connection between WALL-E and EVE.Still, when WALL-E shows EVE a plant he picked up, she realizes that her mission is accomplished, so she then ""hibernates"" and beacons the spaceship to pick her up. WALL-E, though, doesn't realize what she has done when she shuts herself down - he is confused, and thinking that she's solar-powered like himself, he brings her outside to the sunlight. His concern and care for her in the rainstorms shine through, and he also dresses her up in lights when he shows her the beautiful sunset she can't see.When the spaceship picks up EVE, WALL-E follows suit, wanting to protect her but still not realizing what is going on. Once they dock on the AXIOM ship, WALL-E gets into more trouble, being a fish out of water.EVE initially looks down on WALL-E - he's, of course, an older model who's job is just a trash compactor. Her attitudes can be seen on Earth where she initially ignores his attempts to gain her attention. Her desire to protect WALL-E arises not from love but more from a sense of noblesse oblige - even though WALL-E would follow EVE anywhere, she tries to make WALL-E understand that he has to go back to Earth alone, echoing WALL-E's interaction with his ever-present pet cockroach back on Earth.When WALL-E is locked in a space capsule that is set to explode, EVE again tries to save WALL-E. Luckily, he was able to get out of the situation himself, and they meet in space. WALL-E used what he learned of a fire extinguisher on Earth (a hilarious scene) to propel him - here, we see EVE and WALL-E as equals in a beautiful dance of flight around the spaceship.More and more, we see EVE start to care deeply for EVE, and it's not only because he's cute and funny but also because he is unselfish and caring. When the captain asks EVE to show recordings of her time on Earth in order to see the state the planet is in, the recording is left on, and EVE then sees the care WALL-E has taken of her during her hibernation. Also, WALL-E risks his life to protect the plant, not because he cares so much the plant but because he knows how much fulfilling her directive means to EVE. He would do anything for EVE, and, in turn, EVE starts to develop the same feelings towards WALL-E.The two endure various calamity to help the spaceship return to Earth, but WALL-E becomes a casualty in the process. EVE finds replacement parts and fixes WALL-E, but he is not the same - he is only focused on his work, a reversal of roles from the beginning of the film. However, EVE holds WALL-E's hands and ""kisses"" him with a spark, and his memory awakens....It's just amazing to me how all of this is conveyed in the storytelling. The characters' expressions and actions are limited to their eyes and gestures of their hands, yet that seems to be more than enough for the artists of the film to express the character's emotions in a visual manner. Each robot can't but say each other's names, yet their bond comes through without any dialogue - in fact, just the tone of their voice when calling each other's names gives all of the information about their intent or feelings at that moment.In any love story, it's not a trivial task to express both sides - oftentimes, unrequited love 'magically' becomes true love after a single event, when the object of the affection suddenly has their eyes opened. On the other hand, WALL-E provides the viewer with a believable love story where both characters come alive and whisk you away in their universe. It's nothing short of extraordinary....Of course, to say that ""WALL-E"" is a perfect love story is a miscategorization, as it offers a perfect blend of comedy, action, and suspense, along with so many other interwoven messages and jewels - it's just a perfect story, period."
Quarantine             ,A_Roode,1,horror,2008,7,"There must have been comedians in the projection booth the night that some friends and I went to see a family friendly film. These particular friends tend to watch only light-hearted material and get upset for weeks whenever they see horror films or intense thrillers. They were totally unprepared for a 'Quarantine' trailer and it shocked them all so badly that we nearly had to leave and get our money back. Maybe it was because of their strong reaction that my interest in the film has stayed so high for the past several months.This week I have seen both 'Quarantine' and 'Rec' the film that 'Quarantine' is a remake of. 'Rec' is not without flaws but it is a very solid and chilling horror film. 'Quarantine' is able to expand on several of the strengths in 'Rec' while falling into a few pitfalls of it's own. Both films are about a TV news crew taping a show about what a night in the life of a fireman is like. A seemingly routine call turns out to be something much more and the news crew is trapped in a quickly quarantined building.Giving credit where it is due, 'Quarantine' kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It lures you in with a very relaxed opening ten minutes but once you reach the building and the cop in charge asks why the camera crew is there, the whole tone of the movie changes. The fun and games, the light-hearted banter is gone. We only realize how serious it is though when they enter the apartment of an injured old woman. For me the tension starts with the entrance to the apartment and never lets up. Each new segment that the TV crew starts filming holds potential terror. The set design and the lighting are terrific and 'Quarantine' walks a careful tightrope of character action. So often in horror films the audience is yelling with frustration at what characters on the screen are doing because it all goes against common sense. There is a little bit of that early on but 'Quarantine' does a better job of playing to the characters and their panic. Characters die not through naivety or stupidity as much as they do from inevitability and inescapability. The key performance comes from Jennifer Carpenter.The film's greatest strength and weakness at the same time, Carpenter is the focus of the camera because of her role as the reporter and it isn't an easy part to play. She is solid for the majority of the film but terror essentially overwhelms her with ten minutes to go and she is reduced to a sobbing, shrieking, shivering bowl of jello. Would I or anyone else be any better in the situation that 'Quarantine' creates? Hard for me to say but probably not. The problem is that there were three primary acting choices for her to make in the final ten minutes: she could play it as a hysteric (which she does), she could play it as numbing down her fear like the cameraman does in order to try and escape, or she could have been so overwhelmed by her fear that she becomes a functional catatonic working on autopilot. Carpenter's choice is probably the 'truest' choice for how people would react. That doesn't mean that it is going to make for good drama. Her transformation from confident and outgoing to hysterical jabbering is so jarring that it feels forced instead of real. The camera man keeps telling her to calm down when they've reached a potentially safe room but she is far beyond the calming down stage and well into the years of therapy one instead. I found it to be just too much and actually pulled me out of the horror and towards comedy instead.'Rec' felt a bit more organic and gritty than 'Quarantine.' The performances are decent in both but you feel less of a connection to the characters in 'Quarantine.' Many are clearly there to serve as fodder with no attempt to seriously develop them. 'Rec' does a much better job, particularly when the reporter interviews each of the buildings residents. The five minutes spent in filming those sequences gave more of a stake to the audience into the well-being of those characters. That never really takes off in 'Quarantine' and I regret that they didn't follow the lead of 'Rec'. One thing that I thought 'Quarantine' did a much better job of was in plot clarity and how they provided information. The clues to the source of what is going on are much more explicit and come very early in the movie. 'Rec' dropped a few hints for the viewer to put together but relies on the final five minutes to give the major clues about patient zero. What patient zero is spreading is clearer in the remake and I thought the clarity benefited the plot. Of course by the time you find out about patient zero, Carpenter's character is beyond being able to help provide the audience with anymore real analytical power. Don't blink or you'll miss everything you need to know.I give the slight edge to 'Rec', but certainly recommend 'Quarantine' to horror fans. It's problems aren't severe enough to detract from a very decent effort. "
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,acksurfer101,0,drama,2008,10,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder. 827"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,bobsgrock,0,action,2008,7,"After a long nineteen year wait, Indiana Jones is back on the big screen hamming it up and continuing his search for rare and wild artifacts that could seriously take someone's life away. This film has Jones in the late 1950s fighting against the Soviets in order to obtain a crystal skull found in Peru which they believe will give them absolute knowledge over all other countries. Without telling the spoilers, it is important to state right here and now that this is definitely the weakest written of the four films. It simply doesn't give the magic and suspense that Raiders was able to throughout the entire running time. Of course the acting is good with Harrison Ford looking as good as ever and Karen Allen and Shia Labeouf supporting him well. The directing by Steven Spielberg is solid as we get some nice chase scenes and the pace is just fine. Still, it's that script that is giving me winces of pain as I watch this film. Of course, you shouldn't go into this thinking it was going to be as good or better than Raiders or the Last Crusade. I didn't expect too much and that is exactly what I got; not too much but enough to recommend for all fans of the original three to see. Are the first three the best? Of course. Should they have made this fourth one? Probably not. Still, if you are a fan, it doesn't hurt too much to see Indy crack the whip one more time. 1"
Summer Hours             ,home-133,1,drama,2008,9,"This is a haunting film about the distorting effects of monetary exchange on family life and the cohesion of society. It will give food for thought to anyone with elderly parents who may have accumulated a few works of art during their lifetime. At a time of grief, the bereaved have difficult questions to answer. The film-goer is left wondering, ""What would I have done if I had been in a similar situation?"" It is not a film to be quickly forgotten. Although the issue of the fate of the family's country house may be a specifically French theme, others dealt with are more universal and have a deep resonance for anyone with elderly relations. Juliette Binoche may be the name that draws film-goers in, but there is fine acting from all the performers."
WALL·E             ,ilikeimdb,0,animation,2008,7,"The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders. Great summer family fare but not a great movie if you want something more substantial in terms of plot and character development."
Quarantine             ,gisele88,1,horror,2008,1,"Please-save your money and stay home! This was absolutely the WORST movie I've seen since the Blair Witch Project. Hey! No wonder...it almost WAS the Blair Witch Project all over again. Just indoors. If you liked Blair Witch, you'll love this movie. Done from the perspective of the cameraman, it follows a reporter who is supposed to be following a couple of firemen for the day. Once inside a building, the entire place is placed on knockdown. Then you're subjected to an hour of repetitive boredom. Nine people walked out of the theater, and now I wish I had done the same. Let me just say this, if you want to know how the movie ends, watch the trailer (and remember The Blair Witch Project). Same ending."
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,robertallenandersonjr,1,misc,2008,7,"Sistehood Of The Traveling Pants 2 was a very big chick flick. I am a guy and I didn't think it was amazing by any means. It was good though for what kind of movie it was. I mean it did have its cheesy, corny, not real scenes. Otherwise the movie would have been very good. I mean it was very sappy and a love story. It wasn't so funny. The acting was pretty good but nothing very special. I mean it is a couple girls acting a teenagers type of movie so have to give them some credit. This movie did have many flaws and drug on a lot toward the end. You thought the movie would end and it didn't over and over again. It was a little to long. The girls were pretty much never together. So in my opinion the movie didn't really make any sense. It is supposed to be about them being together and best friends. They don't really talk and keep in touch all that much. The direction was pretty good. The movie did teach you a lot of lessons about life and friends though. It could have been a little shorter. It was very romantic though for girls who like romantic movies. Overall this was definitely a good teenage chick flick. I don't really think guys would like this movie. A great movie for girl to go see"
Bedtime Stories             ,jdesando,0,adventure,2008,NA,"""What if the stories you told came to life?"" Bedtime Stories PromoHaving suffered through Adam Sandler's You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008), I was prepared to suffer through Bedtime Stories, his offering in the 2008 Christmas glut of fine movies that have few for kids. Sandler rules: This is one of the best children/adult stories this year, an ironic twist on romantic and heroic tales told from children's point of view through the masterful child/adult lens of an underplaying, child-friendly master.Sandler's Skeeter Bronson takes care of his niece and nephew for a week. Of course he hasn't a clue because he hasn't seen them in four years and his job as super-maintenance man at the Sunny Vista Hotel in Las Vegas consumes most of his time and energy. He's the usual Sandler sweet-hearted semi-loser with reserves of child-like sympathies ready to be released.The conceit is that after telling the humorous tales with the kids' ample and creative input at bedtime, the story elements become real in real life, altered to fit the modern context (e.g., a rain of gumballs actually happens the next day, explainable by a candy truck spilling its contents over a bridge onto Sandler). In this ingenious way, the film recalls the Wizard-of-Oz trick of making real in Kansas what Dorothy had experienced in the Emerald City.There is nothing deep about this delight, just a small satire of a society that may be losing its sense of wonder and fun in order to bow at the altars of nutrition and commercialism. Not bad for a film I thought would be another Sander nodder. It woke me up to the joys of imagination and love.Happy holidays. "
21             ,stryker1121,0,crime,2008,NA,"The true story of six MIT kids who try to fleece Vegas is embellished to say the least in ""21."" There's lots of added drama, a heap of unintentional campiness, plot twists you can see coming down the Strip, and a love story thrown in for the hell of it. This flick was made for the MTV set...the mechanics of how these kids actually count cards to beat the system is explained quickly but not well. I'm probably an idiot (and I haven't read the book upon which the movie is based) but I still don't get it. This movie makes the ""how"" not really matter anyway. Why explain boring old math when you can have montages of our ethnically diverse group of spoiled geniuses bar hopping and shopping at Louis Vuitton? If you've seen the trailers than you know 21...there are no surprises here. There is a long running time that makes the last 30 minutes of the film agonizing. There's a few ham-fisted plot twists and double crosses and I kept expecting the movie to end...then WHAM, another scene of our lead character back at the tables in a cheesy disguise and more slow motion shots of the dealer flipping cards.Sturgess is barely passable as Ben...he doesn't quite have the magnetism to pull off the various emotional shadings required of the role. There are parts where he underplays emotion and parts where he overplays them...he never really finds a medium. ""21"" would have been great ten years ago; give me Giovanni Ribisi in the Ben role and you have something cooking. But Sturgess is pretty blah...so is Kate Bosworth, who looks a lot like Priscilla Presley and nothing like a college student. The only two actors worth a damn here are Spacey, the acerbic ringleader of the young card counters, and the underused Jacob Pitts, who helps recruit Ben into the group.21 does well to show the all-night-long decadence of Vegas, and there are some beautiful shots of the Strip at night. Otherwise the flick is by-the-numbers garbage."
The Express             ,Otoboke,,misc,2008,NA,"Sending off the film in a monologue which encapsulates his entire story, lead character Ernie Davis (Rob Brown) concedes to the fact that he doesn't quite know how to end his story; it's a desirable lack of focus for a man who doesn't necessarily want to tell a structurally sound story, but a powerful and important message about his struggle instead. Yet this sometimes off balanced narrative unwittingly carries through onto this, the big screen adaptation of young Ernie Davis' story, and the movie as a result is worse off, no matter how faithful it may adhere to the source material which borrows largely from the main character's real life biography. The Express for all intents and purposes retains the important elements of Davis' short but inspiring tale, backing up the movie's hard hitting themes with solid heart, soul and passion; yet lumbered with a force-fed implementation that sacrifices the stories emotional integrity for mawkish melodrama, the feature too often looses its footing when it really counts. Nevertheless, with some fitting performances, stark photography and an endlessly inspiring story of unity, social injustice and change, The Express still manages to overcome its weaker moments to make a greater whole.Told through the eyes of up and coming black American football sensation Ernie Davis, The Express delivers a two punch game that fights on two fields which turn out to be one in the same. Ostensibly the feature is about Ernie's battle to the top of the game back in its earliest days when to be black was looked upon as something of a weakness or automatic disqualification from being taken seriously. On this purely face value level, the movie does well; it has the building structure and bubbling tension needed to create the necessary highs and lows of a typical, engrossing sports movie. Watching Ernie is like watching a legend, and that's exactly what it should be like. Sure enough the man is more or less untouchable in the movie's first two thirds, but showing his weaknesses on field would be superfluous at best. Instead the script leaves much of Davis' conflict and hardship to be faced off the pitch, even when he's playing on it. At its heart, The Express is a moral tale of people coming together and letting parts of themselves go that maybe they hadn't thought through quite thoroughly enough; at its core, The Express is about racial discrimination. Counterbalancing the much more visceral aspects of the feature with this emotive, heart felt drama; the movie achieves both a sense of wonder and relevancy that still rings true to this day.Despite the script's well intentioned spirit however, all does not go well when it is finally given transition to the big screen. Director Gary Fleder and composer Mark Isham too often inject the feature with an overbearing, sometimes sickening level of sugar coated melodrama. From the sweeping strings of Isham's sentimentally ridden compositions to Fleder's insistence on emphasising start contrasts between the stories dark and light moments, The Express sometimes boils down to mere caricature that belittles the ideas that the script is trying to get across. Thankfully though, all is not lost in either of their abilities; Isham does far better when scoring for the movie's faster moving segments and Fleder gets some hard hitting and poignant performances out of his main cast. The movie's central performances from Rob Brown and Dennis Quaid are nothing of any remarkable significance, but they serve their purposes well and do justice to the characters that they are playing; sure enough Quaid can be his withdrawn, wooden self from time to time, but his presence is a fine mixture of warm and cold, enough to make the relationship between the two main characters compelling to watch develop.As engrossing as this can all be though, it's oft hard to swallow some of what the movie tries so hard to press upon you; it's a film that tries to raise questions whilst simultaneously answering without being too cynical, and for the most part, does that well enough, even if it is all a little too dependant on sucrose for its own good. So while watching The Express can feel a little like getting force-fed an over-sized, over-iced and over-baked cake to chow down on for two hours, the end result is at least in itself, satisfying. Telling a story of perseverance against the most uncomfortable of challenges whilst at the same time incorporating themes of friendship, family and even a little football into the mix, The Express is a movie that is more about the substance beneath rather than the sometimes troublesome crust that encompasses. It takes a long time to get there, and arguably ends far too late, but for anyone looking for an uplifting and inspiring tale of one man changing the course of history forever, then The Express should do well enough.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net"

I had seen it with a friend, and I love it. Some parts will make you laugh; some parts will make you cry - a little.The film is about Melanie Porter who is ready to go to Georgetown University for college. But her overprotective, police-chief father James, takes the opportunity to ""escort"" her, turning it into from a girls-only trip with her friends to a crazy, hilarious trip with dad.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,cox_gang,0,animation,2008,7,"I saw this movie yesterday at an early preview, and we took our two boys along with us. We found it to be a fun movie, full of action and more than able to keep our kids' attention. The movie itself jumps right into the Star Wars world without any sort of background information, so those who aren't familiar with Star Wars may be a bit lost at first (the movie takes place somewhere in between Episodes II and III). However, the action is immediate and the story moves along well. There were moments of humor with the battle droids, whose vocabulary has been greatly expanded. With a few exceptions, most of the major characters are obviously voiced by different people than in the original movies (though the actor voicing Obiwan was good--we thought it actually was Ewan McGregor), but overall the movie was enjoyable, especially for the younger set."

The actors are very good on their roles and let's be sincere: Ashton Kutcher IS funny! And Cameron Diaz make it funnier even if she's not so funny if she don't have good actors working with her. If you like love comedies you should see this movie, but if you are looking something more brainy...keep walking. Give it a chance! You won't regret. And keep an eye on the secondary roles, because they are as great as the main characters. I hope they work together again as soon as possible,meanwhile I want the DVD release! "
WALL·E             ,Bumblebee_Man,0,animation,2008,9,"When it comes to animated films, Pixar are masters of the craft. Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.The film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.It is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!"", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.Then, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).This love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.Beautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.And that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. -Dan Henry, 20th July 2008"
Prom Night             ,claudio_carvalho,1,horror,2008,3,"In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.The forgettable slash ""Prom Night"" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""A Morte Convida Para Dançar"" (""The Death Invites to Dance"")"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,DancefloorTerrorist,1,misc,2008,1,"The Other Boleyn Girl **SPOILER** Throughout the film there were a few sniggers at some of the incredibly bad scripting (Obviously geared towards the American market- as there were regular bits were the evil Uncle would describe exactly what was going on or would happen in the future and the historical inaccuracies were pretty major). Some of it was cringeworthy in just how bad it was (especially the final scene with the slow fade to black- a picture of a red headed girl and a subtitle explaining how 'Elizabeth would go on to rule England for 40 years ' (or whatever- I didn't read it properly as I was in such a rush to leave).I suppose the actors did what they could with a terrible script and worse directing (scarlett Johansen wasn't as bad as reviews had led me to believe and Natalie Portman was perhaps quite good, though to be honest no-one came out of it well. Eric Bana didn't really have a lot to work with either- pity because I had a high regard for him after the castle and the nugget). The cinematography was also terrible with the majority of the scenes being very poorly focused- It wasn't soft focus or pull focus, it was just rubbish and very poorly done. In fact it was on a par with the script as one of the worst things about the movie.Some of the comments I heard when exiting the theatre mirrored my thoughts but used a few more expletives...Unfortunately I would neither recommend it to a friend or my most feared enemy.I am sorry to say that the only thing I can say in it's defence was that 'the costumes were quite well done' but even they were not exceptional...I was happy when it was over (but would have been happier if I'd seen the scriptwriter and the director get executed rather than the boleyn family).Did I mention how rubbish the cinematography and the script were? Can I mention it again?"
Deception             ,Adam0001,0,crime,2008,7,"Its not perfect by no means, the script has much to be desired and at times the acting was unconvincing. But when I went into the Cinema I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing, in fact I wasn't expecting anything at all. Surprisingly I didn't seam to find the movie overly predictable, however at times its dramatically far fetched. Notably the complete stupidity of a shooting occurring in broad day light in a busy European city going unnoticed. All this being said, the movie is entertaining. I wasn't at any moment particularly board with its rather slow beginning moving on to a fast paces final hour. Surprisingly Ewan McGregor seamed to portray the role fairly well with the exception of a few noticeable accent slips. Michelle Williams on the other hand has much to be desired. In no way am I suggesting she's a great actress but I was surprised at how unconvincingly she portrays a rather simple role. Its definitely a mixed bag, where on one hand its very engaging and on the other it has obvious flaws. I recommend it, you'll be thoroughly entertained but try not going in the theatre expecting to much."
A Christmas Tale             ,bobbobwhite,1,comedy,2008,5,"Started thinking about 20 minutes in, ""when is it all going to come together with some semblance of cohesion and interest?"" To me it never did, and was an overlong borefest throughout, with very short takes leading to other very short takes that never got my interest for any.Never saw any family act the harsh way toward each other that this one did, or talk to each other so carelessly without more mayhem being caused by it than this one did, or showed less love and care for each family member than this one did, even with the mother dying!Why was this kind of labored film supposed to be the right one to show at Christmas? Maybe Labor Day instead? I sure labored through it unwillingly, and it was sooooo long. And, I love French films! See Cache, For the Love of Others or Amelie instead for great French films, and not this piece of pretty junk."

WALL·E             ,Chrysanthepop,0,animation,2008,NA,"Over the years I've become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. 'WALL-E' is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There's hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other's name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve's silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. The animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it's mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E's loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being 'just plain silly'. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While 'WALL-E' tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It's a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,PFNikolai,,animation,2008,NA,"In this day of incredible computer-aided animation and scripts written to keep audiences laughing, it is easy to get caught up in the quality of the production and the non-stop barrage of jokes while losing sight of another objective that a good movie for kids might<U+0097>or even should<U+0097>attempt to achieve: communicating the value of virtues. It is rare that a movie can pull off all three, and I have to believe that effectively communicating values (without preaching) is the most difficult of the three.The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything comes close on all three counts. The animation is good, but it does not amaze. The story has moments of laughter and emotion, but you don't end up caring about many of the characters. And it makes it clear that doing the right thing and being willing to make sacrifices for others is important and worth the effort. In the end, I was glad that my kids had been entertained while having important principles reinforced. This is truly a movie for kids from start to finish, rather than a cute story with mature humor thrown in from time to time to keep things interesting for parents who might not be able set their prurient interests aside for a couple of hours.Now if I could just get those freaky cheese curls off my mind<U+0085>"
The Objective             ,pmdawn,,horror,2008,6,"""The Objective"" is a really cool movie. You have a CIA agent working with military men in Afghanisthan, and weird, paranormal stuff happens. There's a sense of realism - which was probably Myrick's objective - that is very well done here. You feel like you're there with the guys, in that immense, isolated, mysterious space.It's this sense of immersion and the suspense that propells me to give this movie a 6/10, purely because I really enjoyed it. But that's not to say it is without flaws; au contraire, the story is like a mechanical swiss cheese, with obvious, unavoidable and perhaps intentional plot holes - the problem is that some of them nearly ruined the film for me, and will certainly ruin it for the casual science-fiction fan.So there you have it - I liked this movie and I'd recommend it - but I feel this movie could have been so much better if not for some serious flaws.The painfully obvious first one is the narration, done by the main actor. Actually, there are two problems here - the protagonist seems miscast, or at least the actor seems to have a speech impediment problem. I'm not joking, he doesn't narrate, he... mumbles. I hope this was not intentional.One complaint that I've seen in other reviews, but for me would be nit-picking, are about some of the visual effects. Not the FX themselves, but rather the use of them. Like many I feel some things are best left to our imaginations, and this movie is a nice example of getting this sort of thing wrong.There's a fantastic scene in the middle of the movie that involves binoculars. In this scene, the ""leave it to the imagination"" part is incredibly scary. Here, it works. Later on, not so much.I will only further comment on the ending, and I don't have many words to describe my reaction. In a way, it's a genius ending, and in another, you feel like you've been made a fool of. It's usually good to be left with a mystery, but sometimes it pisses people off, and sadly, this is the case with me and ""The Objective"".I know I'll watch it again, though.6/10"
Goodbye Solo             ,jsmith1480,0,drama,2009,9,"Souleyman Savane is a natural. His taxi driver character is the focus of the film and in spite of Savane's complete lack of acting experience he carries the movie with his beautiful, expressive face and the warmth, goodness and simple joie de vivre of his character's nature and, one suspects, Mr. Savane's.The scenes of unexceptional small city life match up right for this story and the scenes toward the end in the Great Smokies are almost as transcendent as they are in person. At 90 minutes it is the perfect length for a movie whose central predicament is made plain from the start and it's resolution never really in doubt. An understandable determination to die by one man inspires renewal in another."

Luckily I used to work at a movie theater so I was able to see this for free and didn't waste ten bucks on it, I did however, waste two hours of my time I could have spent watching something good. Who puts together a film like this? Honestly!

So this was one of the few films at the festival which really exceeded expectations. I knew something was up when it started with the escape itself! Cutting back and forth between the escape and the plan was a device that I worried at first would annoy me, a tip of a hat to Memento but without good reason for being there. I was wrong - in fact the reason we get this structure is one of the cleverest reasons I've ever seen and its only fully clear what it all signified in the last few seconds of the film. But I won't spoil it.. its just worth saying that this film and its clever structure and twist makes it more of a Jacobs Ladder or Memento than a Shawshank Redemption. You need to see it twice to pick up all the clues and understand completely - a bit like Donnie Darko or Mulholland Dr - enjoyable even if you don't get it completely but there are other layers to figure out in future viewings. The film had an interesting look to it like a 70s movie and excellent cinematography although I wished that they'd either not used CG in places or done it a bit better. The acting from Brian Cox (carrying the film) and Stephen Mackintosh (minor role) really impressed, first time I've seen Cox carry a movie since Manhunter. The sound was very interestingly done which is rare and together with the unique, detailed look of the film gave me the impression of a director (Rupert Wyatt) who got to realise his unique vision.... which is what these Sundance movies should be about. The music was quite diverse, and best when not getting too sentimental, but it helped with the pace if not the mood. Leonard Cohen's song also perfectly led us in and out of the story. But the technical side of the film-making from all parties was clearly top notch and Joe Walker's editing, creating a double story while keeping both interesting was also stand-out good. I also loved the retro titles- these films its referencing from the 70s are some of my favourite but this managed to update, subvert and improve them. Hats off."
College Road Trip             ,kxok630,1,adventure,2008,2,"Martin Lawrence, who hasn't been involved in a worth while movie since Abraham Lincoln was president, is back again. My friends talked me into seeing this (instead of a good movie), promising to each pay me the cost of admission if it turned out to be as awful as we had been warned. ""Oh, the critics are never right,"" they said. Yes, the critics are right about this film, and at least I won the bet, but it was a painful way to earn 50 bucks. Lawrence just makes a fool out of himself. The premise is worthless to begin with: frantic dad sticks his nose in his daughter's business as she begins her college career. There is no humor in that. Somehow, it gets worse. The writing is abysmal; of note are the endless babbling speeches by Lawrence, pre-school intelligence level gags, stereotypical characterizations that went out with the dinosaurs, and horribly executed slapstick scenes. The direction is zero: it just poses Lawrence in your face like he's doing a stand-up routine, while other nameless characters do a lousy job of trying to pretend they think he's funny. The amateurish cast's irritating over-acting makes this cinematic flop even more torturous. The audience, like the daughter character in the film, will want to escape from Lawrence's manic ramblings as quickly as possible. Expect this one to have a very short general-release lifetime before it gets shelved in the 99 cent video grocery store bin, and mercifully forgotten. "
Julia             ,thebathroomsinger,1,crime,2008,8,"INTRO: One weekend, some weeks back I went to the movies with friends intending to watch 'Into the Wild'. But as things go in groups, somebody had already seen it and before I knew it plans were laid to watch a film about a girl who got gets pregnant <U+0096> I protested (I hadn't even read the review on IMDb!!!) but I ended up watching it anyway <U+0096> the result being 'Juno' just blew me away.. the story, the acting, the dialogs and of course <U+0096> the soundtrack!Once again I was to go to the cinemas<U+0085> this time I had no real choices - the other options were Jumper, 10000BC and Julia (I'd seen the other good flicks already). I knew from 'trusted sources' that Jumper sucked and 10000 BC didn't really meet our high standards ;) So it came down to Julia - I didn't know what to expect of this film.. THERE WAS NO REVIEW ON IMDb!!! BUT I got brave - maybe I'd learned a lesson after having ventured into the unknown with Juno <U+0096> or maybe it was the 50% discount at the movies this weekend.. I watched Julia!The FILM: When I came out of the cinema I swore to myself that this would be my first movie review on IMDb <U+0096> not so much for the sake of writing a review but for the fact that I'd hate to let a good film go un-noticed! And Julia is a good film, it's a very good film <U+0096> for it kept me glued to the screen once I got 'into' the film <U+0096> which happened about 20 minutes into the movie.. Tilda Swinton played an award-winner of a role as the ever-cursing Julia Harris, who makes it a habit of waking up, unaware of where she's been sleeping. You know, the ease with which she plays an alcoholic totally convinced me that she did drink all that vodka during the making of the film. And unlike her other films, the camera does not show her in that special way that highlights her lovely eyes supported by those high, rounded cheekbones. But you will still fall in love with her <U+0096> and you will also cut down on the alcohol and cigarettes and give up any ideas of easy ransom-money. From the kidnapper to the kid-napped Tom <U+0096> played by the talented Aidan Gould starts off as a kid who is made to nap all the time, more to make it easy for Julia to manage him than to keep him from escaping. But after he has been shoved around a bit, Julia starts to learn how to handle the kid and keeps him awake a lot more, and you start to see some interaction between the two. Julia treats Tom as a mature individual and their conversations show that the kid does have some mature ideas in his head, probably only put there by his millionaire grandfather who is also his sole guardian - but he is quite smart for his age. He also starts to display a range of emotions, more than just fear or anger. You have to see the film to realize how delicate these are. My favorite though, was the look on his face when he wakes up next to a girl one morning <U+0096> I wont tell you where or with whom or how, as that would be a 'spoiler' <U+0085>literally!Well, these are the two main characters that really 'make' this film and around them you will find others playing short but not insignificant roles. I could go on to give you my observations of the characters and my guesses on their lifestyles and make psycho-social analyses. But those are the kind of reviews which restricted my imagination as I watched other films <U+0096> they didn't help me so I figure it won't be good for you either my fellow movie-lover-speculator<U+0085> To sum up, the film has a simple plot that unfolds with time, there aren't any super special effects, no fancy camera-work and despite all that, it still appeals to me <U+0096> like many other simple films have. Normally I'd vote for a 7 on 10 for it being so smooth, but I left the cinema thinking about other probable outcomes, as I wasn't too happy about the way it ended<U+0085> It was certainly possible, but I still wished it hadn't happened <U+0096> but then I wonder how else would I have made the end to this film?? For having created this conflict in me, I'd like to give this film an 8 on 10.And for the doubtful ones out there, reading this review to make up your minds <U+0096> I dedicate this, my first IMDb review to you <U+0096> go for it, you won't regret it!"
Ghost Town             ,Mr_Saxon,0,misc,2008,8,"Let's get this out of the way at the beginning of this review. I don't like romantic comedies. There, I've said it. I'll watch practically anything but if you were to put something like ""Sleepless In Seattle"" in front of me I'd leave the room.Why then, did I enjoy this movie so much? A large part of that answer comes from the man chosen for the lead - British comedian Ricky Gervais has had a great deal of success with the creation of ""The Office"" and his ""Extras"" television series. As Bertram Pincus (great name, by the way), the lonely dentist who loathes human contact (and human beings in general), Gervais' style of deadpan humour shines in almost every scene.He is backed by a superb cast, including Greg Kinnear as the ghostly husband of widow Tea Leoni (an actress I've never particularly warmed to but who actually surprised me in this movie), whose performance never overshadows Gervais' but provides great support especially in the scenes where the two are alone together.Whilst it may not feature many laugh-out-loud moments, ""Ghost Town"" has the ability to bring a genuine smile to your face and has something which many other comedies lack - a heart. Sure, it could easily be described as 'Scrooge In Manhattan' and it features many things you will have seen before (such as onlookers staring in horror at Gervais who appears to be talking to himself when he's conversing with the ghosts), but ""Ghost Town"" has many of its own unique charms.Directed by David Koepp, the movie is a genuinely moving experience featuring a believable transformation in its main character who comes to realise that his self-imposed isolation and selfish ways are only hurting himself.I found myself thinking about ""Ghost Town"" long after the credits had rolled, and have since recommended it to friends. It's a terrible shame that the movie didn't find an audience when it was released in cinemas, but I hope it will find one on DVD. It certainly deserves to and that's not a statement I often make about romantic comedie"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,nadjapfifi,0,animation,2009,10,"The movie was Excellent. My son who is 2 1/2 was just so into it and not scared. They are just rats. Why is everyone so sensitive?! A lot of cartoons have animals that scare people in real life like snakes. Besides, based on personal experience, there was friend who would not let her son watch Ratatouille because of the rats, but then let him watch Dark Knight, hmmm? The mouse was so cute. I really enjoyed that this cartoon finally took a turn from what is usually out there. Right now we are stationed in Germany and the Europeans have a lot more cartoons like this. The graphics are just nicer. I do not have a problem with watching cartoons as long as they are not weird like the standard ones on TV today. For example, the digital mickey mouse. They are just not natural enough. I hope that many people will cherish this cartoon and go back to what used to be traditional Disney style and cartoon"
Ghost Town             ,MLDinTN,0,misc,2009,5,"The main problem with this movie was that it's been done numerous times. There has been many movies about someone who can see the dead and then they try to help the deceased's loved ones. This movie uses a lot of dark, dry humor that is funny at times. Dr. Pincus is played by Brit, Ricky Gervais, and he is constantly a jerk. He always talks about how he hates people and makes rude comments. He dies during a surgery but is revived and can now see and talk to ghosts. Ghost Frank, gets Pincus's help to deal with his widow whom is going to marry someone else. Frank cheated on her and she hasn't forgiven him. Pincus goes out a few times with her and of course likes her even though he's such a jerk and she likes him for some unknown reason. Can Frank solve his problems so is spirit can leave the earth? FINAL VERDICT: It was OK,but sort of boring since this is an old concept. I don't recommend it unless you just have several hours to waste and can catch this on cabl"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,michael11391,1,drama,2008,9,"Let me just say that the movie NEVER had dull moment or even a second in the ENTIRE film!!! Set in South Carolina 1964, Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) who is haunted by the memory of her late mother, tries to escape her lonely life and bad relationship with her father (Paul Bettany), to get past her horrible incident with her late mother. So, she and her caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) flees to a South Carolina town where it holds the secret of her mother's past. Lily and Rosaleen finds the intelligent Boatwright sisters: August (Queen Latifah), June (Alicia Keys and May (Sophie Okenendo) where they take Lily and Rosaleen in, to have a place to stay for a while.The Secret Life Of Bees is a movie of what you call a ""tearjerker"" and that's what it is, the movie will touch your heart and teaches you about life, care, love & forget about your horrible past and move on. As for performances, everyone delivers and a couple of Oscar-worthy ones too. Dakota Fanning and Sophie Okenendo are the ones that delivers the Oscar-worthy performances. Come Oscars season, don't be surprised if any of those both actresses will be in the envelope (they deserved to get those nods!!) Queen Latifah, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson (R.I.P her brother and mother who just passed away one day ago.) delivered their best performances yet even Jennifer (I thought this was her best performance yet and better than ever Oscar-winning performance in Dreamgirls.). As for the supporting actors: Bettany, Parker and Wilds, they did great as well.The Secret Life Of Bees is one of this year's best films, rush out and buy a ticket for this wonderful and amazing film!!"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,soger,0,animation,2008,4,"It is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it.At first I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:1) I quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special I never saw before.2) The ""flies"" in this movie look nothing like real flies. At least they could've make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and slim torsos?3) The story. I guess it was written for 6 year old kids. I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.4) Excessive patriotism. For example: ""They are American files after all!"" Oh, give me a break."
Adoration             ,laika-lives,0,drama,2008,9,"Like almost all of Atom Egoyan's movies, 'Adoration' is self-consciously exploratory, gently tracing the boundaries and pressure points that exist between characters in a manner that asks resonant, sometimes troubling questions about wider political issues without needing to generalise from the specifics. Egoyan doesn't universalise, he doesn't simplify. He may be the least glib film-maker out there.I was lucky enough to see him speak about this film after it screened at the London Film Festival. He was asked a question about the political content of the film; rather than claim that the film isn't political, as I have heard other artists do when confronted with this question about their work, he responded that the politics in the film are entirely located within the family - a refreshingly nuanced response. He is also far more willing to risk losing an audience than almost any other director, pushing dramatic situations into absurdism or uncomfortable comedy, or outright confounding ambiguity, when it would be easier and more surefire to go for more conventional dramatic effects, like irony, or poignancy. For instance, the entire encounter between Arsinee Khanjian and Scott Speedman's characters, in which painful confession and angry confrontation are tempered by the awkward farce of the taxi-ride and invitation to lunch, the unsettling comedy of the confrontation with the taxi-driver, and, most opaquely, the utterly meaningless and consequence-free coincidence of Simon passing his uncle in a bus, and them failing to see each other.Most impressive of all, I think, is the balance this film strikes between intellectual engagement and emotional detachment. After the screening, I told my partner that I'd found it moving, and he expressed surprise, as he valued the lack of sentimentality, almost the dispassion, of the film. Reflecting on it, I realised that when I used the word 'moved', I was using it to express a feeling separate from being emotionally invested in the characters in a film (as in, say, 'Mysterious Skin' or 'Magnolia', both of which sent me off into crying jags). Egoyan's films (with the exception of 'The Sweet Hereafter', which is heartbreaking and cathartic and, as it happens, my favourite film bar none) almost seem to displace my emotional investment into the structure of the movie, similar to the way music engages the listener - or, perhaps, more unusually, they displace it onto the ideas themselves; ideas like the psychology of martyrdom, the instant narrativisation of internet discourse and its consequences, the elusive boundaries of personal responsibility (a recurring concern in Egoyan's films), the conciliatory and revelatory aspects of art, and all the other stuff this movie left buzzing round in my head. If you'll bear with me, I think what I'm saying is that I feel a kind of emotional topography of ideas in Egoyan's movies, a recognition that intellectual frameworks and emotional responses aren't detached in people's lives; the characters, the structure and the brainfood are all connected, in sync; you aren't manipulated into crying, but you may just feel your heart aching all the same."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,shaunricefan,1,misc,2008,10,"I didn't know much going in, aside from the exceptional cast, featuring Eric Bana, Natalie Portman, and Scarlett Johanson. But watching it left me breathless. The story was thoroughly engrossing and kept a great pace, leading to a fantastic conclusion. The actors really get to shine in this character driven story. And stylistically, the film is pitch perfect. I think that just about everyone will find something enjoyable in this film. It's a great date movie, and very thought-provoking at the same time.I give it 4 stars and a 10 out of 10!Excellent!!!Wonderful!!!Beautiful!!! "
Fireflies in the Garden             ,lopcar1993,0,drama,2009,8,"Fireflies in the garden is a very tragic, beautiful and at sometimes awe inspiring. Fireflies in the garden is based on a poem by the legendary Robert Frost and is what inspired this film. This magnificent piece of movie making stars Ryan Reynolds as Michael Taylor a very accomplished and well liked novelist who while going home for a family reunion is meet with an unexpected and heartbreaking tragedy. This film is a study of the human emotion and how one death can lead you to find your way back to the people who love and care for you.Fireflies in the garden is a beautiful film that will have your heart wrenching and at sometimes soaring above new heights. I lost my mom last year to cancer, so this movie was very hard for me to watch, but I made it trough to the end but not without shedding a river full of tears. In our lives we all lose someone we love and we all regret that we didn't do anything different or we didn't bother to be there for them when we were needed the most, and this film tells a story that can make you come to terms with that feeling. It can make you feel like not all is lost and that the grass is greener on the other side.Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts, William Defoe and Carrie-Anne Moss deliver earth shattering performances in a movie that should be recognized as one of the best of 2008, this film should be released commercially to people so that they can experience a movie that will truly touch your heart in many way's. Fireflies in the garden is now and will always be one of my favorite films of all time, and I hope it will be one of yours too."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,bdphill,0,action,2008,1,"I don't think I will be giving away any of the plot because there actually is no plot.I'll start off by saying that the previous three Indiana Jones movies are my favorite movies of all time. When I heard about the fourth one I was excited but thought they should have left it alone because the third one ended the trilogy so perfectly. However, I went to this movie with enthusiam and I really really wanted to like it. Afterwards I figured out that was impossible.I thought the movie would be cheapened by Shia's character or the fact that Indy's character would be about 20 years older. Those were actually some of the very few things that were actually good about this movie. Shia gave a good performance and I actually liked his character. They also did a good job of transitioning to an older Indiana.But the movie just got ridiculous. It started alright as he is escaping the Russians which had invaded a warehouse in Area 51. However, once he escaped they threw in a completely pointless scene. Which, and wait til you hear this one, is that Indiana stumbles upon a mock town set up in Nevada to judge the effects of an Atomic Bomb at, of course, the time of the test. So in order to escape, he jumps into a refrigerator, which they point out is lead lined (will that really help), right before the explosion hits. He is then tossed a few miles in this, outside of the blast area. The door stays closed, he isn't injured while being thrown in this thing at all and feels no ill effects of radiation... YUP.The middle was alright, with some cool chase scenes, decent dialogue, and a cool jungle chase scene with vehicle to vehicle fighting. Indiana did very little of the fighting, and none of it if you exclude hand to hand combat. One of the few bright spots was Shia doing the fighting instead of Indiana.But everything else was terrible. There was an incredibly boring part where they find the skull. Let me summarize that. They find the ruins it is hidden in. They walk through the ruins. They find the skull. And it only got worse from there.After the cool chase scene in the Jungle they escape gigantic ants by a really creepy guy holding the skull in front of them. Then they drive the car (which is also a boat... yeah, I know) off a cliff, but their landing (which is of course in a river) is cushioned by a huge tree that they hit and bends them down to place them gently in the water (Seriously). They then fall off 3 massive water falls, the 5 characters, in this car/boat (that has a jagged glass windshield at this point), and land in the car safely the first two times, and then just each in the water safely after the third one (Seriously, Im gonna say that a lot).Oh! Then they find the entrance to the temple / city thing they are looking for. I couldn't have imagined anything less cool. After simply walking through this they get out the other side to find the city but realize they are being chased by some native people (which aren't explained at all). And how do they survive this, the creepy guy points the skull at them, gee they didn't do this before. Then they get to the middle of the city and break off some things to drain the middle structure of the sand that is in it, then have to quickly run down a circular stair cast that is going away as they run (Which is why Disney should be suing since this was stolen from National Treasure).OK, at this point you're thinking ""well this hasn't been that good, but they've reached the temple, the movie can be saved because here comes the cool part! Here comes the action and the interesting plot that brings it all together."" That couldn't be more incorrect.Here's how I will summarize that part to give it all the credit it deserves. Indiana (and group) walk, yes I said walk (nothing else), through the temple. Creepy guy who doesn't talk carries skull and points it at a door (gee they didn't do the pointing the skull thing before). Indiana holds it up to the door, it opens. Yup, there's your big ACTION / ADVENTURE.AND THEN... They find a room of 13 ALIENS, made completely OUT OF CRYSTAL, but aren't alive. The Russians walk, take the skull and the woman places it on the NECK OF THE LAST ALIEN. The room then STARTS SPINNING UNCONTROLLABLE. Indiana and his group dive out. The aliens then JOIN TO CREATE ONE LIVE ALIEN and use their mind powers to EVAPORATE THE Russian WOMAN. Then Indiana (and group) run out of the temple. No, no real action unless you consider him begging his friend that has betrayed him twice to come with and not to waste time taking treasure action (he dies, just like the mummy, lawsuit?). After they get out by sitting in a WATER CANNON THAT BLASTS THEM OUT they witness the city TURN INTO A FLYING SAUCER THAT ZIPS AWAY! Yup! It really is that ridiculous. They then play some incredibly lame thing about how the gift was knowledge in writing that is on the same level as Anakin's reasoning for going to the dark side in Star Wars Ep 3. After that Indiana marries, yes marries, Marion (girl from the first one) because Shia's character is really their kid. And then they do another lame transition of how he is going to be the next Indiana Jones by Indy's hat being blown almost into his hands by the wind right before Harrison Ford snatches it and walks out. 4"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,Casablanca3784,0,drama,2009,10,"Brad Pitt is not just another handsome guy who's made it big in film. This guy is one hell of an actor who'll walk away with this year's Best Actor Oscar as will the movie garner 10 awards. It is simply a masterpiece; no words can aptly decribe the poignancy and beauty of this celluloid Renoir.Kudos to two geniuses who wrote it;Eric Roth and Robin Swicord,masters of imagination. To think of the idea whereby the march of time runs clockwise for the entire world but backwards for Benjamin is, in itself, masterful. The concept allows for the type of intersection of people and events which has never been shown on the screen previously. I suggest that no one reads anything about the plot because the entire impact of the film will be lost by doing so. See it with an open mind and you will be totally astounded for close to three hours. Every once in a while, a film of this brilliance comes along to take the public by storm, the last being ""Million Dollar Baby,"" therefore get set for another movie treat of a lifetime.Simply stated: this film is NOT to be missed. 1"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,guisreis,0,crime,2015,NA,"Amazingly directed, ""Frygtelig lykkelig"" or ""Terribly happy"" is a tragicomedy movie about an outsider in a tiny town where all the problems are solved there in their way. The outsider is a policeman that has a tainted past which also ended his career but the police solved the issue by its way sending him to the remote insignificant town. The small town in South Jutland itself, besides the cop, may be considered as the main character of the film. In spite of the traits of each of local citizens, the town looks like a being with its own codes, engines, scripts, traps, seeming to plan and to aim, and nobody is able to deviate from that. Off course the outsiders may not accept it. Though, there is no alternative. There is a swamp there, where some cattle, people or problems may vanish. There is also another swamp in town, a metaphorical one, which, the more someone wants to free him or herself, the more becomes entangled, drowns in the mud, like in quicksand. Marshal Robert experiences that. Is it possible not to comply? Is the answer to become a local? As more and more problems emerge and the compulsory path is being unveiled, the audience feels all the nervousness. Really great fil"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,SnoopyStyle,1,misc,2015,6,"The girls reunite after their first year of college.

She declines at first until the other girls tell her about their other plans. The workshop play is directed by Bill Kerr (Kyle MacLachlan). Leading actor Ian takes an interest and Carmen is cast as the lead. In a fit of spite, Lena's sister Effie (Lucy Hale) takes the pants but loses them in Greece.This movie has the same charms and the same problems as the first movie. The goodness in this series are the girls and their friendships. Their trials and tribulations are soapy but compelling although the movie may be too overstuffed with soap opera. The actresses are all terrific. Once again, the problem is that the girls are separated for most of the movie. Their group chemistry is diffused. Of course, the whole point of the series is that the pants connect them as they go off on their own. It's impossible to keep them together for long without losing the whole premise. In the end, this is a nice coming-of-age franchise for girl"
The Burning Plain             ,tigerfish50,1,misc,2010,9,"Guillermo Arriaga was the writer for Inarritu's films (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel) and here dons the director's mantel for the first time on a major film project. ""The Burning Plain"" is an intense story that plays out over thirteen years, although all the action is squeezed into two segments at each end of the time span. The film relates how an extra-marital affair has repercussions which echo down through the following years. The chain of events is initiated when Gina, a housewife and mother, embarks on a passionate romance with Nick, a Mexican with a family of his own. After a gas tank explosion kills the lovers while they make love in a remote desert trailer, Gina's traumatized teenage daughter Mariana becomes friends with Nick's son Santiago. Arriaga focuses on the mother, daughter and grand-daughter at the story's center. He uses four actresses for their roles - two being required for the teenage Mariana and her 30-something persona - and all of them (Kim Basinger, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lawrence and Tessa la) give exceptional performances. When Mariana first notices evidence of her mother's infidelity, she remains silent and carries the burden alone. The breach between them widens as Mariana's investigations confirm her suspicions - and the youthful beauty of her face transforms into a mask as she conceals knowledge which could destroy her family. Arriaga portrays her dilemma with a delicacy that amplifies the girl's pain - showing the silent spread of the poison, its contagion first claiming the mother-daughter relationship, and then creating new ripples of damage which will ultimately infect the next generation.The narrative is tighter than Arriaga's work with Inarritu - a tale illustrating how one transgression can set in motion the engine of fate. He relies on classic cinematic techniques rather than Inarritu's flashy ones - but as in his previous work, Arriaga breaks up the story's chronological flow by chopping back and forth between two time segments. One can't help wondering if it was necessary here, since the story possesses such a strong arc. However, this is just a quibble - ""The Burning Plain"" results in something close to a masterpiece which shares many thematic elements found in the work of Shakespeare, Thomas Hardy and Dostoevsky."
The Burning Plain             ,michaelRokeefe,1,misc,2010,8,"Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga makes his directorial debut with this sometimes disjointed drama piecing together a web of three love stories that interconnect. Charlize Theron plays a sex craving woman troubled by her past. Kim Basinger is cast as a depressed housewife that needs a torrid adulterous affair to seek completeness. Jennifer Lawrence and J.D. Prado are a couple of teens that enter a forbidden relationship in trying to mourn while trying to understand the horrific death of their parents. If you are already depressed...shy away. You must really devote your attention to this one; but if you get lost the finale will answer any questions.

"Surfer, Dude             ",cjr71244,0,comedy,2009,8,"There are a couple main plot points here: some business type money hungry former surfing bastard is trying to harsh his mellow and get Surfer dude to sell out and it's been weeks and then months without surf in California and thus pushing Surfer dude to do things he doesn't want to do.I didn't expect much from this movie but I got a lot out of it. I really loved it. Maybe it's because I was trapped on a plane and this was sort of an escape. There is a little bit of deep meaning in this movie if you think about it.If you are looking for one of those modern dumb comedies with hilarious laughs this is probably not it.If you like the stoned out surf culture and can laugh at it but still can see the heart in surfing and the deepness in it and in not selling out, you will like this movie a lot."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,0,misc,2008,5,"Not bad. This time it didn't feel rushed and the dances felt like they were done to perfection. This time the rich kids are pushed into the streets.This had better dances then the first one, better music and didn't feel rushed. It still had the bad acting but it did have some chemistry. This felt like there was little story going on.The final dance was great. Very dramatic in the rain.The first one had a mix of different dance styles but this had just hip hop dance basically.I recommend it if you saw the first one, like hip hop dance or just like these movies.5/"
Kung Fu Panda             ,Kimberlyjeana,0,animation,2008,10,"I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. This original story is one of the best since Shrek. And the meaning behind the story may be even better! The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.Without giving too much away, when an ""accident"" seems to name Po as the dragon warrior (much to the horror of Master Shifu (voiced perfectly by Dustin Hoffman) and the disappointment of Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force. This is just in time as the villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a snow leopard has returned as he believe is the true Dragon Warrior.I can not recommend this movie enough. Certainly this is marketed for the kids <U+0096> but the whole family will enjoy it. 1"

Yes Man             ,zoe_washburn,0,comedy,2008,10,"I went to this film as one of those process-of-elimination things: Valkry had Tom Cruise, my friend had already seen Benjamin Button, Spirit's show-times suck, my local theater is idiotic and not showing Doubt or Slumdog Millionaire, all leaving Yes Man which neither of us were enthused about, but hey! it got us out of the house. We were shocked to leave the theater with our lungs hurting. The movie was well thought, well executed, and the humor was smart, snappy, and so far from the usual toilet humor of Jim Carrey. I was throughly and delightfully surprised with this film. On the note of message: I think this film actually has a very valuable message. Never in the history of humankind has the average person had so many opportunities to live life in ways never before imagined, yet never before have we been so isolated. Our computers; our phones; our mp3s and ipods; dare I say it, our movies all keep us isolated from actual social interaction. We are skeptical and judgmental about those who actually seek social interaction and friendship (site: Norman) that we fail to realize we are the ones who are actually lame--we are the ones not gathering with the people we love and those we have yet to meet. We are the ones spending our nights lulled into lame predictability, sitting in front of our TVs, telling characters in films to ""just snap it off already."" Yes Man is not just a fun filled film. It is a well deserved social critique. 2"
Good Dick             ,jemalt4,1,misc,2009,8,"Well, where to start?Absolute gem of a movie.All aspects of the acting were superb,great story,and the elements totally worked from beginning to end,at least for me.The video was shot great,I don't know if this is categorized as an independent film,but if it is it would be immensely underrated.It's this type of film that brings real life and cinema to a merge that you are so deeply entranced,you forget where the time went.I can totally get where the writer was going with this.If any one has started a relationship with somebody with a past history of rape or personal ridicule,and who closes them self off to society,you know the hard road it takes to try to ""change"" or turn that person around into understanding that you love them for the reasons you love,fell in love with them.I understand some viewers might not get the way the movie unfolded (girl rents porn,meets guy who ""supposedly stalks"" her which I did not interpret as,has past history,keeps wall up) but there's only so much time to express a wonderful storyline like this and I give it KUDOS!! for the way everything came together , and as far as the ending ,well I don't want to diverge too much into it,but I felt extremely satisfied with the ""open to interpretation"" finish, have come to my conclusion , and say, well, that is life folks ~~love this movie or dislike this movie, It is a great movie in my opinion and I look forward to coming across more like thi"
35 Shots of Rum             ,sandover,0,drama,2009,NA,"I wish I could pin down Claire Denis' charisma. Watching in a row her 1994 'Je n'ai pas sommeil' and this one, there are some quasi-generic features that help defining what it is about Claire Denis.All in all I sympathize with the opinion of the viewer who said this is a heartfelt dissection of familial ties. I thought the comment was succinct.And yet the reviewer who said the new rice boiler was a new start and the funeral at the ending was sufficient occasion for the 35 rhums theory to be 'celebrated' by Lionel, was the one who made me start. I am not at all sure that the new rice boiler stands for new beginnings. And while the end turns around an occasion of mourning, I was under the impression that what is depicted yet never shown was Jo's wedding: her white dress, her mother's necklace, the furtive clad-as-groom appearance of Noe hesitating in front of the two doors, etc, mark for me, although this can be a total mistake, a familiar Denis device: nothing is as it seems, and that means that.Let me explain a bit my remark. Denis is an economist by formation. What does economy in Denis' film account for, ultimately? And this makes me go back to my preliminary question, that is, What is it about Claire Denis? Oscillating between a somewhat anthropological b-movie, with its clinical, sometimes random like a jotting, drab shots of ordinary time (preparing food, consuming it -note the remarkable scene of three people in a row, in the kitchen, eating standing a silent, quick meal- the repetitive routes of suburban trains etc) and its elated reverse, sudden side with small scale yet condensed and beautiful though emotionally complex rituals (notably the dance in the bar sequence)that seemingly discharges packed-up emotion and pressure from the unexplained portions of raw, elliptical meaning. There may be an overt tone of post-colonial discourse, she may even have detested her studies, it may smell like a b-movie, or, bluntly, like another introvert-and-what-the-fuss-about french film, but I think it demands a very strong hold to tackle with understatement and finesse the issues, the faces, the spaces and the tissues of human economy, rubbing shoulders with the imperceptible and the unsaid.Aside procedures in the film, and I mean by aside non-cinematic ones, highlight what is going on, more to the spirit of the auteur. Take in the opening credits the way the names of the actors appear: all in three rows, watermarked, and then highlighted, appearing like noon-ghosts; or Tindersticks' score: in the beginning the Messian-like onde mazenot throws a note of otherworldliness, only to be dismissed by a almost naive, post-colonial (sic) subdued, carousel music, that weave together at the end in a defying way, as in general the music slides in and out of the film, casually and perplexedly, not frightfully important yet - yet...nothing is as it seems, weighs down its cliché. And that is that, the tautologies that are offered in the film, like the father's stubborn silence (what a perfect silence!), cannot, in the end be humanized into clichés. A neighbor who is a lover, or was one, a missing, an absent, a dead parent, or an all too present one, centrifugal urges to leave this way of life, because ghosts overpopulate the seemingly tepid urban scenery, a friend and a colleague who leaves his job and encounters death, the encounter of life-as-promise, ties who are untied or untidy, all this is loose and shiny, even in the autumnal Parisian light, and maybe, narratively, they leak out as everyday clichés, the way one takes the train. Unless they drink 35 rhums."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,fisherbee1-1,,animation,2008,NA,"I took the kids to see this one, and they all thoroughly enjoyed themselves (even the teenager!). Personally, I got a kick out of the story; with all the twists and turns, you never know what is coming next, or where it will all lead. There are realistic personal situations for our favorite veggies to deal with, plenty of action to keep things moving along, and all the laughs and silliness that we have come to expect from Veggie Tales. The moral was there, of course, presented so wonderfully and cleverly that even the secular audience grasp and appreciate the lesson.

Trucker             ,p.newhouse@talk21.com,1,drama,2015,NA,"The storyline could read like a role-reversal remake of the 1986 Sylvester Stallone film 'Over The Top'. On the surface it would appear to be just that, but this is a much deeper, more subtle treatise on the reunification of long-separated parent and child. There might have been high melodrama and histrionics in a such a piece as this. Instead, we are treated to a lean, spare script which spares the viewer from being talked down to and repetitively spoon-fed information that can be clearly seen quickly, and are presented with quickly but carefully and accurately sketched characters who are exquisitely portrayed by a truly talented cast. The pathos is definitely made more palatable by brief spates of levity between the characters. Michelle Monaghan and Jimmy Bennett, as the two central actors, are well matche"

The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,Michael Fargo,1,misc,2009,10,"It's not insignificant that this story reaches us at this time. Reactionary movements are all around us, some linked to the events (and there are many events depicted here) in the film.This is the opposite of Oliver Hirschbiegel's static, embalmed ""Downfall,"" the recreation of Hitler's last days. Uli Edel takes Stefan Aust's book and infuses it with kinetic energy. It's one of the best uses of montage in recent cinema and the sound design fits in squarely with the sophisticated visuals and elaborate re-staging of the crimes of the Baader-Meinhoff gang, aka, The Red Army Faction.I saw this film just after watching Ang Lee's ""Taking Woodstock,"" a very different evocation of a turbulent era. Equally successful here is the recreation of a revolutionary time where everyone seemed to be fighting against something and to be fair, there was a lot to argue rightly about changing. It all came down to the methods one used, and using the guilt of post Nazi Germany, the Baader-Meinhoff gang became delusional and grandiose in their ""methods"" of social change. ""Urban guerrilla"" was the fashionable name at the time, today we call it terrorism.The film doesn't bother to weigh whether anything legitimate was anyone's goal. It opens with a stunning set piece at a demonstration against the Shah of Iran and a riot that pits Right Wing elements against Leftists. As the violence escalates, there are several tracking shots ahead of charging mounted police on horseback that is so electrifying, I sat there wondering, ""Can this film top that opening?"" Well, it does.It holds the interest of the audience through a very complex series of robberies, bombings and kidnappings. I was reminded of ""The French Connection"" in the use of sheer excitement to keep an audience engaged in a very elaborate political movement that terrorized Europe for nearly a decade (at least the cast of characters depicted in this film; activities of the group are stillarguablyalive).Some have argued that the focus of the film on the crimes of the group glorify them, but no more than, say, the Barrow gang was elevated in Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde."" We're given Baader and Meinhof's dialectic, but we're clearly watching psychotic/psychopathic people; and no one can deny they had a following.It's a long film, but I think it's very efficient in the story it tells. Over two and a half hours, I can't think of any scene or crime that should have been cut. As well, the film is full of dialog and the English titles require you to miss a great deal of what's visually on the screen. I plan to see it twice as a result.Huge rallies and set pieces are recreated. The only documentary footage that I recognized was from the Munich Olympics. Sobering in its account, there are many lessons we still need to learn from these events. I was reminded of one of Leonard Cohen's lyrics: ""I've seen the future and, brother, it is murder."" Let's hope these methods are in the past and not our future. We need to ensure that."
Goodbye Solo             ,TheFilmBloggerdotcom,0,drama,2009,7,"Within two minutes of the start of Ramin Bahrani's new film Goodbye Solo, the titular character, Solo (Souléymane Sy Savané), a Senegalese cabbie living in North Carolina, asks his fed up and begrudged-to-be-alive customer, William (Red West), ""You're not gonna jump, right?"", and up until the film's close, this becomes a question that hounds Solo and the viewer equally. An exceptional drama that finally opened in the U.K. on a limited run this week, Goodbye Solo is a subtle and meditative look at sadness, alienation, and what connects us as human beings.The setup is simple; Bahrani throws the viewer straight into the first meeting between Solo and William inside a cab, with William offering to pay Solo $1000 for a $200 fare to Blowing Rock if he agrees in advance to do it. Suspicious that William is going to throw himself from Blowing Rock, Solo cannot tear himself away despite William being cantankerous and closed-up, and decides to try and convince him not to end his life.On the other hand, Solo is a rather charming and likable fellow, who is working towards becoming an airline assistant in order to adequately provide for his pregnant wife (Carmen Leyva) and her daughter, Alex (Diana Franco Galindo). Entirely converse to William, he is affable, open, and hopeful; thus he is the perfect vessel through which this mystery story unravels, for he is sympathetic and takes the journey with us to see what William is going to do at Blowing Rock.What I admire most about Goodbye Solo is just how genuine it is; we get the inkling early on that Solo is a truly caring and optimistic young man, and so his concern towards William doesn't feel forced or overly contrived. His outlook is also interesting as juxtaposed with William's defeatist attitude; the film remarks cultural differences, such as how in America, families do not look after their old, and Solo compares this with how he will be cared for in Senegal when he is William's age. By proxy, the viewer of course associates this with their starkly opposed outlooks on life, and while the film refuses to be judgemental, it causes one to consider whether William's bitterness is a cause or a by-product of his loneliness. Solo's life is far from perfect either, though; his wife doesn't appreciate his efforts to make a life for them, suggesting that perhaps Solo is just a few years away from the decades of loneliness that William has endured.Through and through, it is the emotional plausibility that makes this film so compelling; it staunchly refuses to succumb to melodrama. Little gestures like William graciously accepting a beer from Solo exhibit Bahrani's nuanced hand for human interactions, and in not making William an entirely lost cause, he also doesn't set himself a task too difficult, or risk contrivance. It's other little nuances also, such as William's ability to help Solo prepare for his airline test, which impressively does away with stereotypes and also provides small hints about these characters; despite his Southern accent and the implication that he's a no-nonsense, impatient old man, there are these small glimpses that tell the attentive viewer so much.Agonisingly drip-feeding the viewer morsels of information about the central mystery works best in films that are short; in that stead, the conceit doesn't becoming too tiring or repetitive, and Goodbye Solo, at 91 minutes, perfectly understands this concept. In many ways it's frustrating that it takes so long to find out anything about William (and by the end we still don't know that much), but that's a testament to the living colour of Bahrani's characters, that they are compelling enough for us to want to know more.Knowing full well that this scenario is likely headed for a rather uneasy climax, intrigue transfers over to Solo in the latter portion of the film, as we become immersed in his life, and wonder how he will stop this joyless man from taking his own life, while juggling a new child and a broken marriage. Few will expect the film to be tense, but enormous suspense is wrung out from the fact that Bahrani has written the film to such a point that either conclusion  William killing himself or in fact having other intentions  would be emotionally satisfying and plausible, and so the climactic ride to Blowing Rock, although quiet and minimalist, leaves the viewer to stew in the insecurity of their own making.The key on which the film ends is going to probably frustrate as many viewers as it satisfies, and while many will class it as a ""non-ending"", it is an end emphatic of so much more than a simple question of ""did he, didn't he?"". These notions of uncertainty, of the abyss, are in tone with the authentic existential themes present throughou"
The Ruins             ,Kashmirgrey,,adventure,2008,7,"Director Eli Roth should take note of and learn from this film. It is what Cabin Fever hoped to be... spooky.Two twenty-something couples are vacationing in Mexico when they are invited to witness the excavation of some ancient ruins. Instead of fun and excitement, however, the four are held captive at top of the ruins by the locals. But it isn't long before they find they may be in even greater danger. Something cunning, hungry, and green has a taste for human flesh and the four vacationers have rung the dinner bell.The characters seemed real. The mood was gripping. There were some good scares.

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,aquaangelgirl,1,misc,2008,7,"I was really looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint for the most part. Blake Lively seems overwhelmed by the depth of her storyline at times, and Alexis Bledel does not seem to be improving in her acting abilities since leaving Gilmore Girls. She does seem to play well off others, against Lauren Graham on Gilmore Girls, and in the scenes with Amber Tamblyn in this film. Amber Tamblyn stood out in the ensemble, conveying more emotion with her expressions than through her dialogue. America Ferrera brought some of the strong personality of Carmen back towards the end of the film, but I thought her storyline had some flaws. The setting of Greece is beautiful as in the previous film. I do think that this sequel was able to overcome some of the more generic moments of the first film"
The Objective             ,nineveh-4,,horror,2008,8,"Many people don't get what the supernatural events were about in this movie. It is normal because it contains elements of common themes of ghosts and ufo. However, it deals with neither. Many of the events of the film makes sense if you understand occult lore of the Middle East surrounding creatures known as the Djinn.Forget about the Aladdin version of the Djinn. Mythological and occult lore of the Djinn is entirely different. Djinn are said to be of fire that doesn't burn. That is an ancient reference to electricity or magnetism. The word jinn in Arabic has the linguistic meaning of 'invisible' and it also shares the same linguistic root as the word 'mad'.Let's take a closer look at the movie...1) The man in the cave is actually a sorcerer. The beings he was communicating with are the djinn. They are invisible to the naked eye, but they registered on the solider's equipment. He provided them water that turned into sand. Djinn in ancient lore are able to materialize things ranging from food to gemstones. However, they eventually turn to dust.2) Evil tribes of the djinn such as the Beni Ghilan (followers of al-Ghoul) are believed to consume dead human flesh.3) Ancient records detailing djinn materialization talk about strange sounds like 'buzzing bees' before they appear. In this movie, it is the buzzing sound of a chopper.4) Magnetic phenomena....there is a little known Arabic text called the Green Island dating back to medieval morocco. This book talks about a man who was kidnapped by the djinn and taken to a magical island. He was returned to his village many years later. He left behind a make-shift map trying to point out where this magical island was. Modern researchers of the story tried to correlate the map with modern geographic data. They discovered that the instructions placed it somewhere in the middle of the Bermuda triangle. The mountain range appears to be another secret home of the djinn and thus seem to reflect strange magnetic phenomena.5) Weird lights...the same old occult texts when discussing djinn manifestation refer to lights that suddenly appear and shine upon the sorcerer from which emerge strange figures (the djinn).6) Ending....djinn are reported to have strong telepathic abilities and to be very secretive of their reality. The film's ending is about a man whose brain was scrambled by the djinn after being touched on the forehead by one of them. He got too close and he was neutralized and left behind as an example...I don't claim to know exactly what the script writer intended with all of those references. I am making an educated guess here based on the similarities (coincidental or intended) between the events of the movie and the ancient mythological narrative.Check out books such 'Book of Deadly Names' for more info on the djinn. 1"
Milk             ,Chris Knipp,0,misc,2008,9,"'Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain,' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.In 'Milk' the topic widens to gay politics and gay rights. ""These are not 'issues,'"" Harvey Milk tells a major opponent, ""these are our lives we're fighting for. "" His own life peaked at a transformative place and time for homosexuals, San Francisco in the 1970's. A San Francisco Supervisor assassinated by the disgruntled conservative Supervisor Dan White in 1978, Milk was the first openly gay man to elected to public office in California. He was a gay activist who gained fame and political clout. ""A homosexual with power--that's scary,"" Milk tells Mayor Moscone--an ally with whom he sparred, and who was assassinated with him.If he hadn't been killed early in his political career Milk might have traded his jocular title of ""Mayor of Castro Street"" (the city's predominantly gay district) for the formal one of Mayor of San Francisco. Dan White himself predicted this.While Milk sought the whole city's attention with a seemingly trivial cause--a ""pooper scooper"" law forcing citizens to clean up after their dogs, he has come to represent a profile in courage--a man willing to face up to Orange County bigots on their own turf, who insisted all gays must come out of the closet to unite in strength. The film doesn't idealize the man; his private life is obviously messy, and despite his preaching, he was in the closet to his own parents. His lover leaves him, and a new Latino boyfriend (Diego Luna) is totally unstable.Every gay advance seems to bring on a backlash. After the 1969 Stonewall Riots (alluded to in news footage as Milk opens) more gay men and lesbians were out and proud, but Anita Bryant, the Florida orange juice advertiser and right-wing Christian gay basher, was on the rampage campaigning for measures all over the country to remove gay rights. In California in 1978 one of her many causes was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, which would have mandated firing all the state's gay teachers.Today, while the election of an African-American as President makes the US look more friendly toward minorities, anti-gay measures are still on ballots in many states at election times. On the same day that Obama was elected, Californian gay people saw the passage of Proposition 8, put over by Mormon money, to outlaw gay marriage in the state.Leaving behind the hermetic, personal wavelength of his best film 'My Own Private Idaho' and the stylized elegance of his recent quartet of films, Van Sant returns to a conventional mode closer to his 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Finding Forrester'--but this time with more scope and more commitment to taking a stand as a gay man with a wide audience. The writer for the film was the former Mormon Justin Lance Black, writer for several gay-related films and the TV series about a polygamist Mormon, ""Big Love."" Harvey Milk (a nicely modulated Sean Penn) first appears recording a tape testament in his final year of life, a scene that bookends the film. Penn's noted for emotionally overwrought roles but his Harvey Milk is someone who rarely loses his cool or his sense of humor even when he meets the hostile Briggs or regularly has to deal with his clueless, inept opponent Dan White (a fine Josh Brolin). Milk mocked the right-wingers' fiction that homosexuals are pedophiles who want to proselytize youth--that gays are made not born--by opening public addresses with, ""My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you."" It's a line often repeated in the film.The movie, as is the way with conventional biopics, paints its subject's life in broad strokes. He meets his young lover Scott Smith (an appealing James Franco) while a corporate drone in New York. They decide to start a new life in San Francisco, and open a camera shop together on Castro Street. Before long Milk is in the thick of political activity, talking to Teamsters and cutting off his beard and pony tail and donning suit and tie to meet the general public.Milk emerges as a true politician. Moscone compares him to Boss Tweed. Through leading a successful boycott of Coors beer for the Teamsters, he forges strong links with labor. Scenes are crowded with political coworkers, and resident cute boys.Most of all the movie is a picture of community organizing and campaign management. This is told in broad stroke too, but there are many historically specific personalities. Milk ran for office many times before redistricting made a clear win possible. Scotty is his manager, till he can't bear another losing campaign and moves out. Next Milk ""recruits"" a cocky young runaway and street hustler, Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), who claims he can get a thousand gay men on the street on demand and also boasts ""I don't do losing."" With his new well-connected lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) he secures endorsements from the Bay Guardian and the Chronicle, and he wins handily.It's unusual for a mainstream film to get so much into the practical details of local politics. At the same time Jack is jealous of Scott and Cleve and moving toward a meltdown, and Dan White, having his own more dangerous meltdown, is waiting in the wings.As a San Franciscan I wish the atmosphere of the tragic finale had been properly amplified by a horrified awareness of the Jim Jones massacre, the news of which had emerged barely a week before White shot Moscone and Milk. But otherwise this stands as an essential piece of gay and California history and Van Sant's fluent, lively film couldn't come at a better time."
Milk             ,Red_Identity,0,misc,2008,NA,"Great story, very engaging. It is lead by fantastic performances and amazing writing and direction.Sean Penn gives one of the best male performances of the decade for sure. He captures so realistically what many other actors in the past have done with real life people. He captures all of Harvey Milk's mannerisms and emotion so well. He will certainly get an Oscar nomination, possibly even a win. Now, to the strong supporting performances. Many of the attention has been given to Brolin and Franco, but I thought that Diego Luna gave a very disturbing and real portrayal as Milk's lover, Jack at one point in his life. Yes, it was hard to watch, but I feel that Luna really stood-out, and it is a shame that people have not really recognized him as well. James Franco also gave a very strong performance, as did Emile Hirsch. But, here is a surprise, I did not think Josh Brolin was anything special. He has been the supporting actor who has been getting most Oscar attention, and most nominations and even awards. He was good, no doubt, but he lacked a lot in scenes I thought. I was expecting him to do more, and I am sorry, but I do not think he deserves an Oscar nomination, let alone some awards he has taken home(they should all go to Ledger for his amazing performance as The Joker). But it is not a big deal, like I said, he was good, but just not nearly as good as he is being praised. The screenplay is fabulous. It slides, and it does not linger, and never plays out very easily. The direction is superb, as is the rest of the film.Here is one amazing film, by any means. It grabs you, whether you like biographical films or not. It is a film, and all of the characters you deeply connect with. Certainly one of the year's best films"

How to make a second dreadful movie, starring Al Pacino, how to entice two award-winning actors to become whores for $15 mill. each -- all actors are whores if you pay the right price -- how to make a cheap looking low budget flick with two greedy major actors who look old, play older and die -- unfortunately only one of them -- at the end. Hollywood independents will pay big bucks for big talent to simply use it in such a low class, stupid, predictable, tasteless flick. Stay away from the theater, it's not even worth a download. Starting with the awful script, I wonder who was the executive genius who greenlighted it, then I can imagine a morning phone call from Bobby to Al, both dragging their feet after a short night's sleep: ""Hey, Bobby, read that piece of s#@& they want us to do?"" ""Yeah, Al, I did and I'm thinking it's immoral to turn down $15 mill., it's like pissing in the temple, brother. Let's do this s#@& and laugh all the way to the bank"". Hollywood film making at its best."
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,MBunge,0,adventure,2012,7,"Like staring at the ocean horizon from a desert island or being rocked to sleep in your mother's arms, The Yellow Handkerchief is a warm, enchanting and entrancing experience. With a story built on the calm and measured magnetism of William Hurt, illuminated with youthful flashes of spirit by Kristen Stewart and Eddie Redmayne and sheltered under the beautiful pain of Maria Bello, this film invites you in from the cold and lets you nestle in its relaxed tenderness. I'm not much for slow, sentimental tales of lost love and teenage angst, but this movie has made be reconsider that. If anyone ever tells me a motion picture is ""like The Yellow Handkerchief"", I'm definitely going to give it a look.Brett (William Hurt) is a grown-ass man who just got out of prison. There's no one to greet him in freedom, so he starts walking south. At a diner, he meets Martine (Kristen Stewart) and Gordy (Eddie Redmayne). One is desperately looking in others for what she can't find in her own father and the other is an awkward bundle of nerves who thinks he's Jack Kerouac but is mostly just whack. Gordy does have a convertible and the three start off on a little trip across the river and, through storm and scuffle and keep on driving until their stories spill out of them, especially the woman that Brett's bound for even though he's not sure if she'll welcome him or if he deserves it.Hurt's character is as much at the heart of this film as any I've seen, as the world-weary Brett's journey with these two emotionally exposed kids is interposed with his memories of May (Maria Bello), the damaged woman he fell in love with at the sight of her soulful face. The two tales wonderfully compliment each other as Brett is the one drawn irresistibly to May while it is Martine and Gordy who find themselves caught up in his gravitational pull. Hurt gives an award-worthy performance that is all the more notable for how he never overpowers his younger co-stars. Don't get me wrong. Stewart and Redmayne are marvelous in their own right, but it would have been so easy for Hurt to dominate the screen instead of letting Brett be merely the center of it. No one would have objected, yet that ultimately would have sucked the melodic ease out of the movie and robbed it of its human depth.Kristen Stewart also deserves a lot of praise because her role is written quite obviously. She's playing a wounded girl who's anguish is visible to anyone who looks at her, something that's not all that easy to pull off without overshooting or underplaying the affect. Redmayne's part is more overtly colorful and obtuse but it comes off a little bit like shtick. Stewart feels like a living, breathing, confounding teenage girl.I also want to single out director Udayan Prasad for praise. His narrative and visual confidence is second only to Hurt's acting in making The Yellow Handkerchief work. This story is quiet and slow and the temptation to speed it up or do something on screen visually out of fear of losing the audience's attention had to be a difficult beast to battle. Prasad let's things unfold in their own due course and perfectly balances the trio in the convertible with the flashbacks to May. This is the sort of direction where you can't easily notice what's being done, which I find much more appealing and proficient than films where the director is practically waving at you from the screen.The Yellow Handkerchief is a darling production, which is an adjective I don't think I've never used before or even appreciated what it really meant before now. Why it was not a much bigger deal when it came out is a mystery to me. Maybe Stewart's inclusion will eventually attract some Twi-hard attention to this little gem. Something good ought to come out of those sparkly vampire flick"
WALL·E             ,Mr_B_Natural,0,animation,2008,10,"Wall-E is the film Pixar has been working toward ever since Toy Story first tested the boundaries of computer animation. It is without a doubt the best Pixar film, if not the best computer animated feature ever made, and it ranks with the rest of Disney's classics.The story is both timeless and timely. 700 years after Earth's citizens flew away from their dumpster-like planet, one robot, the dirty and old yet clever and plucky protagonist Wall-E, is still condensing the mountains of trash into nice little piles. He discovers many of the trappings of civilization, most notably an old VHS of ""Hello Dolly!"" which teaches him about true love.His simple life is thrown into disarray by the arrival of another robot, Eve, sent from the humans' ship on a top secret mission. For Wall-E, it is love at first sight. But when Eve is whisked back to the spaceship, Wall-E stows away as well. Soon not only is Wall-E's courage tested, but also the humanity of all the citizens who have now become fat lazy blobs who live gliding along an easy chair.To start, the film looks gorgeous. While that is something we have come to expect from computer animated films thanks to today's technology, yet again we truly see the wonders and mysteries of outer space. But the film is much more than beautiful: it is also hilarious. On one level it has many topical jokes concerning the humans on the ship. But on a higher plane the humor of the robots has the quality of silent comedy, particularly Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (in fact, unlike most of today's very chatty animated films, there is very little dialogue). In addition, the visuals are accompanied by an excellent score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty). Songs from Hello, Dolly insterspersed in the movie also enhance the story. Finally the voices are skilfully done. The robots' sounds convey true character and emotion, and Jeff Garlingives a great performance as the main speaking role of the film, the ship's captain.There is a lot more to say about this film. For one, it owes a huge debt to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the musical selection to the look of the ship. The amount of plunder from Kubrick's genius would be pathetic if the film itself was not brilliant or innovative in its own right. Wall-E is an experience to be seen, to be heard, and to be felt. It is a story of timeless love and a cautionary tale of where we may be going as a species and as a planet. But above all it is a masterpiece of cinema, and a work of art you must see."
Four Christmases             ,Lois_Geraghty,1,comedy,2009,1,This has got to be the worst movie ever made!!!. Reese Witherspoon sleep walks her way through this movie and hardly ever makes eye contact with Vince Vaughan!!. Vomiting babies and siblings trying to wrestle each other just don't do it for me!!. I must admit Vince did try his best to make some humor but was terribly mismatched with Witherspoon. They had zero chemistry and it looked like Witherspoon at times just wanted to run off set and never come back!!. I just don't get why she keeps making comedies as she is so much better at Drama and is a good actress as proved by her Oscar and other awards she has won. I say don't waste your money on this it is an absolute stinker!!.
Igor             ,Hack_Writer_77,0,animation,2008,6,"King Malbert (Jay Leno) rules the world of mad scientists with flashy clothes and dark storm clouds. As such, the mad scientists all clamor for the honor of winning the royally-sponsored ""Science Fair"". Each scientist has their own right arm, an Igor, with optional Lorre-esquire manner. When one scientist's efforts leave nothing but his actual right arm, however, his Igor (John Cusack) sees a chance at greatness, in activating his own monster. But is he too good to be evil? This one's a sleeper in every sense, which is kind of a good thing. Although it's a grand year for animation, with ambitious offerings from many studios, sometimes you look for something a little simpler. Igor excels at that. There are just a few things that keep it out of the ""great"" category, so let's point those out first. Technically, there are a few instances when the lip-sync is off, probably due to shuttling, as noted below. A noticeable number of the jokes (and a couple of songs) have the feel of being recycled from other animated films, which is never good. This being an animated comedy, that naturally hampers the story a bit. Although pop culture references (a recurring complaint on various message boards) are kept to a bare minimum, the ones used...well, grate on the nerves a bit.The good parts: the film is beautiful to look at, in a ""Tim Burton"" fashion. The tight animation is well-serviced in digital; a feat in itself, since the credits reveal that this thing was literally made around the world. Visuals of the environment are consistently stunning. The stylized design does help to endear you to the characters, who themselves are a parade of great ideas, with voice talent that shows some thought. Examples include Igor's pals: the surly Scamper (Steve Buscemi), a reanimated roadkill rabbit, with the tire track to prove it, and Brian (Sean Hayes), a disembodied brain in a machine, named by way of dyslexia. There's also invisible talk show host Carl Cristall (voiced most appropriately by Arsenio Hall) and the villain's girlfriend, a shallow, multi-personality fashion plate called Jaclyn Heidi (well-voiced by Jennifer Coolidge). Even the James Lipton cameo is oddly appropriate.So, in short, what works really works, and what doesn't really doesn't. It will likely be a welcome dollar peep once Halloween is closer."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,Naimi12,,animation,2008,NA,"I absolutely loved this movie! I liked the animation, some of the music, and the plot, and it had some funny content, which was mostly found in the dialogue. Although this movie had few songs compared to the Jonah Veggietales movie, Bob the Tomato and Jr. Asparagus were barely used at all, the music video at the end was weird, the credits didn't have any funny songs like Jonah did, and the ""pirates who don't do anything"" in this movie aren't pirates at all, I personally found this one of the most entertaining Veggietales productions. What's more, this movie has a moral lesson that I think applies to all Christians and not just those in a specific situation, unlike some of the other Veggietales movies and videos. It teaches about the importance of fulfilling the call that God has on our lives. So I highly recommend seeing this movie because it's very entertaining and useful"
College Road Trip             ,ShineBrightTonight,1,adventure,2008,10,"The previews do not do it justice. I expected to see a crappy film but i had nothing better to do. To my surprise...This movie was good,not great(10) but definitely not horrible(1-2). Adults keep in mind that this is a movie made for kids just because it has college smacked on it doesn't mean it's adult material! Though the movie has it's flaws it is a total package of family fun. The leads Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symone have a very nice chemistry together as do all of the cast! The movie contains clean humor and doesn't look to sex and violence to rake in money! It is a decent movie which is very much needed in the times of the blockbuster mad just to pull in cash! The major flaw in the movie is that it seemed incomplete and at the same time some scenes were unneeded! Again i urge you to ignore the critics and go see this. Oh and this has a B rating on yahoo! just throwing that in there lol! B(7 out of ten)"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,elb_s,1,misc,2013,10,"Despite being politically active, and (I thought) relatively well-versed in 20th century anti-capitalist/colonialist revolutionary movements, my knowledge of the RAF going into this movie was scant.Probably because I'm American and have been raised on our cultural propaganda (wherein historic social victories are whitewashed to locate success only within our infallible constitutional framework; and where any revolutionaries since the Founding Fathers could not have acted on beliefs that were righteous, and must recant those former beliefs with soul-searching regret for their UNRIGHTEOUS ideologies)I expected a lot more focus on maudlin gray area. Not that the film cast the RAF as heroes to cheer for. Reading the reviews here, I recognize now that the critiques of the RAF's actions were present, just not in the ""hit-you-over-the-head"" manner of U.S. documentaries.Despite the harms done by the RAF (which were minuscule compared to the harms they protested); despite the contradiction of so much of their ideology and praxis with my own beliefs (e.g., their embracing nationalism, assassination, etc.)--I'll be damned if I didn't cheer for them all the way through.I'm surprised so many have presumed this film wouldn't resonate with a young American audience. While not so young myself, I spent a great deal of time with folks of all ages in the heyday of Occupy. The frustration at the collective inertia to action amongst complacent modern Americans is palpable amongst folks of all political stripes. And growing...at a certain point, the swelling malcontent can't help a *bit* of respect for groups who actually act on their articulated agenda...and an agenda that includes killing a few bankers and fascist cops? The elite talking head circle underestimate the mood of the American public if they suppose the history portrayed here would evince emotional disconnect or outrage. Besides, the acting was beyond-respectable, the pace engrossing, and the recreation of the era felt authentic. Admittedly there were loose ends regarding ideological development...thankfully the internet and my library provide me plenty opportunity to tie up those ends.As initially stated, I find my inner blood-lust a bit disturbing upon reflection (you hear that PRISM? I neither have nor plan to have a murderous vanguard association at any point!)...but in this era of learned helplessness, I'm not sure that's entirely a bad thin"
The Escapist             ,ggoldberg1,,crime,2013,4,"I am usually a big fan of prison movies, but not this one. It was too unrelentingly dark and depressing for my tastes. Even prison has uplifting moments. Between the bad sound, the unfamiliar slang and the strong accents, I often found it very difficult to make out exactly what was going on. The lead - Brian Cox - did a good job, but the main bad guy - Damian Lewis - was too clean-cut and just did not fit the part (although I love him in Homeland). The whole drug factory in prison making a non-existent drug just seemed silly to me. There is no way that one would have the privacy to go through all the steps that it took to make it. The premise of an experienced middle-aged convict breaking out of prison because his daughter is a junkie seemed stupid too. What would he be able to do about it when on the run from the police? A lot of people seem to like this film, but I am not one of the"
Deception             ,dilbertsuperman,0,crime,2010,1,"This is a reasonably slick looking movie that falls flat on it's stupid face, as the movie starts it seems to hold promise, we obviously know there's a deception of some kind going on, but it's not quite clear what kind of setup it will be. By the time you see the end scene you will want to take whatever media the movie is on and smash it to bits for being so incredibly and utterly, ridiculously, pathetically STUPID. Whoever wrote this script was borrowing heavily from a MUCH better movie. SKIP this movie, go watch the movie it ripped off:The Spanish Prisoner.PLOT: a charismatic new friend introduces a bored/boring accountant to some women that would normally be out of his league, it all seems to good to be true, then comes the gotchya. Unfortunately you will see it coming a mile away, and the end of the movie is so stupid, and so terrible you will really regret watching this dog. If they cut this movie in half and decided to re-shoot it with a believable ending, it might have been a 5, but this movie is a solid 1 because of the low IQ of the plot.The Spanish Prisoner with Steve Martin is a thousand times better than this stupid dog, that ripped of that script and added some scantily clad women as window dressing and a completely unrealistic ""love"" interest."
Lakeview Terrace             ,jaredmobarak,0,crime,2008,6,"If you wanted to see a face of shock, you should have seen me when I found out the new Samuel L. Jackson vehicle Lakeview Terrace was directed by Neil LaBute. When I think of the man I can only conjure images of the fantastic Shape of Things and In the Company of Men, and I haven't even seen that one yet. To watch the trailer for this seemingly generic, racially motivated clash between neighbors just made me shake my head in shame. If it weren't for the cast<U+0097>or the free screening pass<U+0097>I probably would have completely passed the film up, without a second thought. So there I was, sitting in a packed theatre, in a somewhat foul mood as security made us check our phones at the door, taking mine despite the fact it has no camera, waiting past the advertised start time. And then came Jackson on screen, waking up from sleep, fixing a photo on the nightstand of he and his wife, slowly moving downstairs to meet his children. This is a parent of morals and intelligence, telling his son to remove a Kobe Bryant jersey because of what the man stands for and constantly correcting his daughter's English so as not to have her sound like an ignorant girl from the streets. Watching him fold laundry on the couch next definitely woke me up; maybe I wasn't going to get what I thought I would after all.We are introduced to this man, Abel Turner, a cop and single father, trying to raise his children right. A man who worked double shifts and extra security jobs in order to move his family outside of the South Central neighborhood he grew up in. Sure he is rough around the edges, but he is a man of principle and it seems one that loves his children and would do anything to protect them. This buildup puts an entirely different spin on how he reacts to the moving in of Lisa and Chris Mattson, (Kerry Washington and Patrick Wilson respectively), an interracial couple buying their first house. Where the trailer just shows racial tension and disgust, the actual film shows someone trying his hardest to get along, but truthfully not being shown very much in the way of friendly neighbor from the newcomers. Between making love in their pool, within eyesight of Jackson's house and the children looking out the window; Wilson throwing his cigarette butts into his yard so as to fool his wife; and a little hostility early on, one might see where Turner had a point. Is the man a little wrong in the head, though? For sure. His intimidating demeanor is not helped by the little tests he performs, including pretending to hold Wilson up in his car with a flashlight.There really isn't much to the story besides the escalating tensions mounting between the Mattsons and Turner. What at first can be construed as getting off on the wrong foot soon grows to borderline hatred with a touch of malicious intent. The threats fly and retribution is begun<U+0097>you shine a flood light into my bedroom, I'll do the same. Not too long after do the children become involved, acting out against their father wanting to get to know the neighbors while he tries to shield them away. While I did not anticipate the high jump Jackson's games take towards the end, stopping any fun that might have been mixed with the not so subtle hints for the newly weds to move, going straight into thug territory, I was not surprised. The introduction of a character early on has no relevance if the story didn't evolve to the point it does at the end and it's convenient events like this that threaten to ruin what is working. The story is very neatly and meticulously put together, but maybe a bit too well done. An obstacle looming heavy over the whole film is the forest fire slowly eating its way closer and closer to the street that the action takes place on. Having such a backdrop always in mind screams artifice and truthfully does take you out of the movie a bit. Yes, they are in California, but instead of introducing the fire so early on, (I believe it's the first thing we hear on Jackson's alarm clock radio), they could have made it a problem with subtlety. We know the dangers of the area and would believe a fire starting; we don't need to be hand-held through the ordeal. Also, there is an underlying duplicity that crops up often. Jackson's partner is living with decisions on whether to try for a promotion and move his family to a safer neighborhood, thus allowing us to find out Abel Turner's similar predicament twenty years earlier. There is also the story of what happened to his wife, a tale whose explanation is revelatory to his feelings towards the Mattsons, I won't say more, but you will see the mirroring for yourself when viewing.When you do look at Lakeview Terrace from afar, you will see some very intriguing instances of race, social status, and other barriers coming to the forefront as catalysts for the strained relationships cropping up. These are the kind of issues you expect LaBute to grasp ahold of and do something inventive and provocative. There are moments, don't get me wrong, but in the end, this is a studio picture and I'm sure his hands were tied just enough to keep it all reined in. However, there is that edge to it, sometimes more pronounced than others, along with a great performance from Jackson, as well as the others. With a fitting conclusion and overall entertaining suspense, I'd say LaBute has found a happy medium between Hollywood-fare and his indie/stage sensibilities. I just hope he goes full indie next time, because that is where he truly excels."
Ponyo             ,DICK STEEL,1,animation,2008,10,"Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off. I thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic, and I didn't have to wait for an invite to make sure I got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie, scheduled to open here next week.For fans of Studio Ghibli films, you'll probably know what you're in for, as Miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography, that will win new fans over. I'm embarrassed to say the least that I've so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro (eyes that pile of Ghibli DVDs) and love it to bits, but I guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that I would enjoy.Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea, with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek. Nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution, and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature as well. An accident one day sees Ponyo being washed ashore, and picked up by five year old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor. And you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of The Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids. Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2D glory, knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on. There are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame, that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all. This definitely beats any 3D or CG animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity, and not only from the artwork department, but on its story too, despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic. While there are avenues to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both kids and adults alike.At its core, its about love, that between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo, and I tell you Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve all hands down. Characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions - if she's upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended film, so don't you go missing this on the big screen!"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,john-davies160,1,comedy,2009,1,"I endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity. It has to be one of the worst films I have ever sat through. I am amazed that this film currently has a 7.5 star rating. The acting is awful, script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny film I cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. Check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. Come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly."
Wendy and Lucy             ,goddestroyer,1,drama,2009,9,"our main character, the undeniably cute, drawing, and irresistible Wendy, heads on some kind of early 20s sojourn from the dull mid west to explore the northwest and Alaska with only a month's savings, her 80s Honda accord, and her dog and best friend Lucy. Without any spoilers, her car breaks down in Portland, and the film is an emotional, patient, voyeuristic narrative of how this situation unfolds.having introduced the film as loving it, what immediately struck me upon finishing it is how many people would be bound to hate it, either by missing the boat entirely on understanding, or by not having lived any similar experiences in their own lives to be able to understand the worthiness in this story being told.In other words, I can instantly predict views upon the movie's main character of being negligent, lazy, naive, and viewing the film as a very drawn out boring portrait of situations unfolding as nothing more than a result of her lazy and negligent behaviors. For instance, ""well what did she think would happen if you drive across the country with 500 dollars in an old car?"" or ""she deserves to lose her dog when tying it up outside of stores"", or ""if she just had a job and afforded a cell phone, she could have avoided a lot of these problems."" You may very well have these points of view if you watch this film, and as i said, that is missing the boat on understanding or apparently not being able to relate to the true reality of the character.i will tell you how i personally view the story. Wendy's story is the vehicle to make deep cutting commentary about the most pressing issues in American class-system society, done eloquently without even using words at times. The film paints a picture of a deeply partitioned society. That of those living in ""the system,"" (almost all of us), those living outside the system (Wendy, the marginalized few...), and those who impose the system for their gain (such a small section of the population that they remain anonymous, unrepresented. the elite class). the workers who are working so hard to uphold the very system that is keeping them down and making them work so hard. those like Wendy live with none of the other things we have come to measure success and happiness with like money and a house and fancy things, but instead they spend their lives profoundly getting to know themselves and loving the ones they hold dear with all the time and attention they deserve. (loving Lucy the dog, in this case).All the while we see colorfully illustrated examples of how this wage slavery system is really dehumanizing us all. its not human to wait in cars on freeways for hours, its human to be walking in the woods alone with your dog, connecting with her. its not human to stand 12 hour solitary work shifts simply being a security guard for a Walgreen's parking lot making minimum wage. its not human to just kick someone out of a parking lot simply to uphold the rules of not being a customer, it's human to stop and talk to the person, find out why they are their, and use your good judgment on how to handle the situation.The film seemingly obviously wants to communicate if nothing else that the fact that every inch of our lives is dominated by money and how much we have should be cause for question, and that those who reject the wage-slave system don't outwardly have much, through this renunciation they have gained something that they deem much more important. being a human, knowing oneself, being close with other living beings in way's that aren't possible if 40 hours or more of your life is wasted for someone else's profit.what unfolds in Wendy is an image of a young adult who rather than spend her time trying to fit into a position upholding the system that keeps us down, has decided to spend her time living for herself, better understanding of herself and nature. The scene when Wendy goes to the pound to check the cages for her lost Lucy, consists of a 1 minute long uninterrupted tracking shot, where in at an even rate the camera indiscriminatingly moves along past dozens of cage jails cells, past different dogs of all breeds and personalities. While I believe some might sit through this and be checking their watch and sighing, sensing it as just a sad boring shot, I think they just fail to make the 8th grade metaphorical connection that each of us in the wage slave system are just another one of the caged dogs. To me that piece becomes the hinging point of the entire film. yes, its a long shot because life is long and complicated; it takes a long time to come to face the hard truths of all these locked up dogs, of realizing we are locked dogs.That would have been a lot for this movie to have going for it to catch my attention, but on top of that the whole movie is filmed in Portland, thus making this Oregon kid very nostalgic and instantly connected to the mood that the film environment creates.add on top of this, Michelle Williams is absolutely perfect in her portrayal, and enduringly gorgeous to watch.'getting' this movie or not is going to become a gauge for me for someones personality type in the future"
Iron Man             ,Chrysanthepop,0,action,2008,NA,"Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'."
The Express             ,acs_joel,,misc,2008,5,"I grew up following Syracuse sports. I remember Ben Schwartzwalder being interviewed on Sunday mornings on channel 3 in Syracuse.The film was a disappointment for me.Have the director or cinematographer actually ever played football? The football scenes were very contrived and not realistic. As football movies go, The Express looks like girls' field hockey.The writing was corny. This story needed more of an edge, dealing with racial tensions and sports glory. It comes off as a made-for-TV movie of the week.Dennis Quaid, although one of my favorite actors, is miscast. Ben was a hard-nosed guy, Dennis is just can't pull off the scowl.As much as I thought I would like this film, that's how much I dislike it. By the way, how did the film end? I left early"
Iron Man             ,DICK STEEL,0,action,2008,10,"With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season! 2"
The Reader             ,ccthemovieman-1,1,drama,2009,9,"Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can ""Hanna Schmitz,"" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover ""Michael Berg,"" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as ""Rose/Illana Mather."" ""The Reader"" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film. ""Hanna Schmitz"" turns out to be an incredibly simple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in a long time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.Kudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It must be strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes he did with 30-something Winslet.Overall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you and makes you ponder its main characters. 1"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,haleyshopefarm-1,1,misc,2008,2,"This story is not close to being correct. First off, Anne was the younger sister (born in 1510). Mary was the mistress to King Francis of France she returned to England with Mary, Queen of France after the death of the French King Louis She became Henry's lover. She became pregnant and was married off to William Carey. The King NEVER acknowledged her child as his. Anne was STILL in France with Queen Claude. She was never banished to France. She returned to England when Henry changed allegiances from France to Spain. When Anne returned she fell in love with Harry Percy (who was NOT betrothed to anyone) It was a love match. The King saw Anne and became besotted. He had Cardinal Wolsey separate them and then Percy was married off to Mary Talbot. Henry adored Anne. He was never anything but generous to her and she hated him only a little less than she hated The Cardinal Wolsey. She blamed them for separating her from her love, Harry Percy. The King pursued her and she refused him, this went on for 6 years. she finally fell in love with him. They married (after he split from Rome) and were happy. Elizabeth was born, and Henry changed the Act of Succession to make Elizabeth his heir. It wasn't until the second death of a stillborn son that Henry had had enough. The saucy temperament and sharp tongue he loved in the beginning began to wear on him in the end. One of the greatest historical quotes is from Anne in the Tower ""when I no longer hated him, he began to hate me""This is a great story if told correctly. This movie was awful. Anne was not guilty of adultery and the scene with her brother never happened.In fact it was the situation with Mark Smeaton a court musician that caused Anne's downfall. She was accused with him (he was tortured to admit guilt) and with all of Henry's friends from the time he had first met Anne, her brother was thrown in to make sure there was no sympathy for the Queen. Interestingly, even though most of the people hated Anne for what had happened to Katherine, Henry's actions made the people sympathetic to Anne as they did not believe her guilty of what she was accused. Jane Seymour was no longer a secret. I am amazed that such an inaccurate movie would be made and the worst part of this is that in a time when women had little to no power, a young girl changed the face of the world.By refusing the greatest man in the land..The King. Her end was tragic and not her fault. It was the doing a spoiled and old man who was always looking for the greener grass. The movie was shot horribly and the costumes were seen too often. Katherine of Aragon was not an ugly woman but one worn down by lost children and a philandering husband.The best movie on this subject was Anne of The Thousand Days. The Tudors on Showtime is good but also rife with historical inaccuracies. Mary was not the saint she was made out to be but a whore who gave everyone everything and asked for nothing. She did live a quite life after the death of her sister.And her children were honored by Elizabeth I"
Saw V             ,Meven_Stoffat,0,crime,2008,1,"Lionsgate seriously needs to know when to stop. The tagline of the movie is ""You Won't Believe How it Ends"", but really, what I can't believe is that the series has NO end. I mean, if you look at it the way I do, the series pretty much died with Jigsaw. And that's saying quite a lot. Talk about beating a dead Jigsaw. Saw IV was pretty pointless but it had its moments. Saw V shows that the filmmakers are now trying to make money.The film picks up where Saw IV left off- Hoffman is now the newest person to carry on Jiggy's legacy and will do whatever it takes to get it un-noticed. That is, until Strahm survives one of his traps and is now off to kill Hoffman. Meanwhile, somewhere else, 5 test subjects are in a house, one named Brit, played by Dexter's Julie Benz, who wears a hilarious fright wig that somehow changes itself in every scene. The goal is to kill each other until one's surviving to get out of the house. Some traps include the necktie trap, and even the razor hand trap.And that's all you need to know. This one is a real dud, Not only are they carrying on a series that didn't need to be carried after our very own Jigsaw died, but they're also trying to be like Saw I in some bits and even Saw III. Plus where's the gore? With how gory it is, this should be rated PG-13. The only gory bit is in the beginning with the pendulum trap. Not to mention the ending, which sucks big time too, because there's no twist!!! I'm sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a Holographic cover, and even a ticket to Saw VI, will no doubt showcase all of its alternate endings, but at this point I'm not sure if I even care.Overall, this is a complete waste of time, and is just another attempt to milk the cow from Lionsgate and Twisted Pictues. Maybe I'll see Saw VI, but just to see how it all ends. Saw, your time is over, and it's time to pass your crown over to Bousman's upcoming ""Repo! The Genetic Opera""."
The Ruins             ,sajjukcor,,adventure,2008,1,"This movie was really awful. It was not in the least bit frightening, or even startling. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and by the end of the night we were saying ""The Ruins ruined my night."" I would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident.It is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. The plot was nearly non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and they gave no back story whatsoever for anything that was happening, and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel."
Wendy and Lucy             ,arthurallblack,1,drama,2008,10,"This review is coming from the perspective of a viewer in the exact same situation as Michelle Williams' character. This review will not summarize any key plot points nor try to pretentiously deconstruct the film in the air of a film school thesis, this review will put it to you as truthfully as the film has.I honestly feel that Wendy and Lucy shines a light on a part of America that is widely ignored; a part of America that's left behind by the faults and actions of The Bush Administration and those who feed off of greed and capitalism. For those who fit within these margins will go see this movie and fail to grasp the understanding of how it is to be desperately broke and have nothing else to hold on to but a few scraps of memories, soiled clothes and your trusted dog to help prevail what's left of you dignity, happiness and sanity. This is not an escapist film, for escapism is for people who can't cope with their own realities. That's why there is so much success in drugs and the media. Wendy should be praised for holding onto her convictions and not falling deeper through escapism. But when your reality is so harsh and greater problems seem to arise everyday, she can't even afford the luxury of escapism as others do, so why should the audience have any exception? Life is very complicated and it can't be wrapped up in a limited amount of time. The open ending reveals to us that nothing is certain, but it certainly must be better than right now. There should be no ending, no ""to be continued"", only ""What now?"" ""Where to go next?"" ""What am I gonna do"" ""Where will I sleep tonight and will it be a safe spot?"" If those aren't the questions going through your head as you watch Wendy in the end then you have lived a privileged life and will never have to worry about being thrust into such a situation where you have to give up everything you have left in hopes of things getting better soon.In a recession, this film should be seen as a lesson of how to live and what to do when comes the moment where you lose everything that's ever meant anything and how to live and restart from there. Of course every decision you make isn't the smartest one, but when you're desperate and have no other choice then you have to do whatever it takes to survive, even if that risks you a day in jail.We observe Wendy and Lucy from a voyeuristic standpoint. We meet up with them in the park, observe their actions, then watch them leave. For those with a sympathy toward the downtrodden we tend to feel a little sadness, maybe even a little guilt for not being able to help that person out more than we could. But there are also some who have been raised with everything handed to them and with easy opportunities. They look at people like Wendy and Lucy as a stupid bum who can't get it together, without ever realizing that not everyone has it as easy as they did.I have no idea how to end this review, but I just thought I'd write it as a bit of a rebuttal to all those who have completely missed the point of the main character and her actions which have led the movie to it's conclusion. If you've never truly suffered like the way Michelle Williams' character has then this movie will be lost on you. You may relate more with the clerk in the supermarket. But for those of you who've ever had to live in their car for a stretch clawing onto every dollar for dear life hoping to one day catch a break, then I must warn you that this movie will make you cry. And there's is absolutely no problem with that. I know how it feels, and sometime you just have to let it out in order to go on. Sometime you even have to let go of the things you love the most if you even want things to get better. For some it's impossible to do, but it's just as hard to watch. 1"
Frozen River             ,jotix100,1,crime,2010,9,"Life has not been kind to Ray Eddy, the mother of two boys, and a husband with a gambling addiction. As this sad tale starts, Ray find herself in one hell of a predicament. She is about to receive her new trailer, and doesn't have enough money to pay the man that is bringing it to her because her old man took it all to gamble in Atlantic City. To make matters worse, this place where she lives, upstate New York, near the Canadian border is an inhospitable place, where winters are harsh, lasting forever.Ray is working part-time at a dollar store, probably making minimum wage. The dilapidated small trailer in which Ray and the two boys live is an uncomfortable place to be. She even feeds pop corn and Tang as dinner to the kids. Her prospects for earning more are almost nil. At this point of the story, she visits the bingo parlor in search for her man. What she finds, instead, is a Mohawk woman, Lila Littlewolf, getting into his car, parked outside, which she drives away to the reservation.Lila Littlewolf's life is not much different from Ray's, with the exception that she is involved in a somewhat lucrative business smuggling illegal aliens across the border. She needs Ray's husband car because the big trunk will hold at least two people to take to the American side. Ray and Lila don't see eye to eye when they meet. Lila, who is a single mother herself, has been robbed of her baby by her mother-in-law, who took the infant away. Lila asks Ray to help her as she will split the profit with her. Thus, Ray decides to go along. The main obstacle is the crossing of the frozen river that separates the U.S. and Canada, where the illegals are held by Quebecois criminals. At first, everything goes well, but sure enough, the local police are know about the smuggling Lila. Ray, being white, has a better chance of not being a suspect. Unfortunately, things come to a head when the police give chase to the car in which Ray and Lila are taking two Chinese illegals across the border.Ray, who up to this point is in the scheme to get enough money for the new trailer, sees a different angle when she and Lila enter the Mohawk reservation, where supposedly the police has no jurisdiction, after being followed. Ray has a change of heart and realizes that Lila has to pay a greater prize for her actions.""Frozen River"", written and directed by Courtney Hunt, marks one of the best film debuts in recent memory. Desperation and poverty draw two opposites to do a criminal act. Ray and Lila are as different from day and night, yet the two women come together because they have understood they are basically the same. Necessity makes them partners in what first appears to be a pure business deal. Their meeting will change both Lila and Ray forever.Melissa Leo, one of our best character actress, shines in this sad story. Ms. Leo has given great performances during her career, but she outdoes herself with her take of a desperate woman driven to her wits' end by a situation bigger than what she thought it would be. Same can be said of Misty Upham's portrayal of Lila. A poor Mohawk woman that has been cheated out of what she loved most, she finds herself helpless. Both Ms. Leo and Ms. Upham are perfection under Ms. Hunt's guidance.Judging by this auspicious debut, one can only hope for more of this talented young director, Courtney Hun"
Hancock             ,carvercape,0,action,2011,1,"Well now I think someone should stop giving money that let's Will Smith make any movie he damn pleases.It was OK for Bad Boys, that ain't so bad action flick, Independence day we survived somehow but with consequences worse than alien in a movie put up with. But this?! What in the name is this all about?! Why did anyone gave money for this to be made? It is supposed to bring sort of fresh look at superhero movies. Maybe on a paper it all makes sense but choosing Will as main actor, that is where things went wrong. Heck Will acts same in every movie. That separates good actors from bad ones in a first place. If you wish to explore new concept in a movie you have to bring in actor that can carry that concept damn excellent, otherwise it will just ruin it like in this movie.To be fair Will is not only thing wrong here. Jason Bateman is also so irritating beyond description.Only thing fairly good are CGI effects.Rest is utter cra"
The Dark Knight             ,LoneWolfAndCub,0,action,2008,10,"I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with ""Batman Begins."" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (""Thankyou for Smoking"") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!! 6"
Summer Hours             ,estreet-eva,1,drama,2011,2,"I'll save you two hours: the mother dies, the brother and sister move away and the main character sells the house. That literally captures everything that happens. This is a no-drama drama - there are no fistfights, no screaming, almost no conflict of any kind. There are a small number of subplots that suddenly materialize and then go absolutely nowhere. I can only recommend it for fans of that dizzying shaky hand-held camera cinematography that is unnecessarily employed in these type of arty films. At a loss to explain the glowing reviews of the outing. Maybe the sequel (call it ""Autumn Hours"") will offer a little more entertainmen"
Death Race             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,0,action,2008,5,"If I could describe this movie in one phrase it would be this: pure f'cking insanity. Everything from the action, to the plot, to the dialog, is absolutely ridiculous beyond comprehension. But...It doesn't really matter...Because Death Race may just have the craziest and most explosive action of the year.Death Race knows what it is and does not disappoint. It doesn't take itself seriously and try to be existential and have a point. There is no point. Suspend reality (because even in desperate times, we ALL know that this will never happen), and sit back and enjoy the high octane adrenaline action. Few movies have as many explosions as this one. It's insane.Don't worry about the acting, as there isn't much to act. Jason Statham delivers yet another nuanced and subtle performance, filled with rage. Although 85% of the film's action sees our characters in the steroid pumped racecars, true Statham fans should be pleased with the amount of hand to hand combat as well (a lot was kept out of the previews, so it was surprising). Tyrese Gibson gives us more of the same, while descending into a darker role with ease. It's basically as if his character from Waist Deep was murderous instead of heroic. Joan Allen is the lone real performer in this movie, and she provides quite the presence as the Warden of the prison.Destined to become a cult classic just like the original, Death Race gives us some of the most exciting action of the year, while reminding us that we will never be as cool as Jason Statham. While the lack of iconic lines and characters is bothersome, the memorable action somewhat makes up for it. I do take points away from Death Race for being the most predictable movie of the year, and I'm not talking about the ending, which tries to be clever (*slaps Paul W.S. Anderson across the face*). I was able to predict lines of dialog, how action sequences would play out, and which characters would die. Actually, the latter one isn't that hard to figure out...If you're looking for your typical mindless action vehicle that is sure to leave an explosive impression, Death Race will fit the bill. Don't expect greatness, because the film is all about low expectations."
Trucker             ,TxMike,1,drama,2010,NA,"This movie was made on a very modest budget, reportedly $2Million which by today's standards is chump change. One of the producers is Michelle Monaghan who also has the lead role as a trucker with a young son she deserted when he was only one. I suppose this was a work of passion for Monaghan and it comes across that way. It is a character study, and it works sometimes, at other times it comes across as trite.Michelle Monaghan is Diane Ford, and as the movie opens we see her having aimless sex on the road. When the young man offers to exchange phone numbers, or email addresses, she just looks at him with disbelief and leaves. That is how her life is, and has been.Jimmy Bennett who was the poor little brother in ""Orphan"" is Peter, almost an orphan in this story. When Diane left 10 years earlier, he was cared for by Benjamin Bratt as his dad Leonard Bonner. Leonard and Diane had met up when she was 18, she got pregnant quickly, found she could not be a ""wife in a house"" and that was when she left. But now Leonard is dying of cancer so Peter needs a new home.We wonder, will it work out with Diane, who only sees him as an obstacle? At least at first.I had some difficulty concentrating on this movie. I ended up watching it in pieces on 3 separate occasions. There was one, and only one, moment that made me really care, and really see a point in the story. Peter was asleep on Diane's couch when she came in. She looked at him for a few seconds, then went in closer, she smelled his head, then she put her nose close to his nose to smell his breath. It was the type of instinctive thing a mother might do, especially one like Diane who was more like an untamed animal. It showed she was finally beginning to care about hi"

The Duchess             ,ferguson-6,1,misc,2008,6,"Greetings again from the darkness. The film fascination with Royalty continues thanks to the coolness of costumes and the grand scale of palaces. Of course, a thread-thin relation to Princess Diana doesn't hurt at all either.Somehow the man's world of the Duke of Devonshire, played by Ralph Fiennes, allowed for multiple affairs even to the extreme of having one's favorite side dish just move right on in to the main house ... including meals with the Royal couple!! It would be quite funny, if not so sad.Keira Knightley plays the Duchess with fortitude and the proper amount of reservation. She has become quite adept at the period piece. Fiennes, on the other hand, plays the Duke as if he has a constant stomach ache and is in need of Alka-Seltzer. He totally lacks charisma or even many human traits, save lust for those other than his wife. The third wheel who is promoted to second is played well by Hayley Atwell, a desperate and alternatingly cold and warm mother and friend. Rounding out the cast are Dominic Cooper (Mamma Mia) who plays future Prime Minister Charles Grey, and the true love of The Duchess' life; and Charlotte Rampling as the too proud mother to Knightley, who dispenses very weak advice with a stiff upper lip.The film is well done and the similarities to Princess Diana's marriage are inescapable, but there is just not quite enough substance here. Easy enough to watch, but lacking in historical details ... more of a soap opera approach"
Milk             ,bkoganbing,0,misc,2008,10,"I remember back in 1978 when I heard about the assassinations in San Francisco. The screaming headlines read Mayor Moscone Murdered on the tabloid News and Post in New York. You read the article and it said that a San Francisco City Supervisor named Harvey Milk was also killed by another supervisor Dan White.What I didn't know was how much Harvey Milk reflected my own life. A former Goldwater Republican and closeted gay man, he moved to San Francisco and affected a revolution. That was me and three years later I came out and started doing my own thing for the same righteous cause, Milk gave his life for.Milk was not the first openly gay person elected to public office. Elaine Noble and Allan Spears were serving in state legislatures when Milk finally was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Milk was not a single elected official in a large body of legislators. He became the focus of stopping a rollback of our rights that the newly empowered religious right was seeking to do and God help us, still seeks to do. San Francisco no longer is THE gay city as it was in Harvey Milk's last eight years of his life. So many places now have GLBT rights laws, so many have created their own gay culture and network. Still all of us owe so much to Harvey Milk and his circle who would not back down.A few days ago I saw Sean Penn in Bad Boys and to see him 25 years later as Harvey Milk, it's hard to believe the breadth of work that he's done as a player. There's a nomination in this for Best Actor and maybe a second one to go with the one Penn won for Dead Man Walking. You are so taken with his performance that you forget and think you're watching a hidden newsreel of the life of Harvey Milk.Josh Brolin might very well bring home an Oscar for the uptight Dan White, the assassin. What's extraordinary about Brolin's performance is that White is such an ordinary man, trapped with a set of values that taught him to despise anything different than him. There's some suggestion that White was a latent case and that might have been the ultimate reason for his terrible acts. I've seen that happen often enough in my life.In my working days before retirement in 2002 I was the only openly gay person at the New York State Crime Victims Board working there and still am, sad to say. Harvey Milk was brought to political activism by someone he knew being targeted for hate crime homicide which was never solved. In the more enlightened times of the Eighties and Nineties these things still go too often unpunished. Like Harvey these incidents were my reason for involvement.Watching Milk and inner circle many of whom went on to do great things in the Gay Rights movement, I envied them. I certainly put my years in, still do. But I would have given anything to have been involved from the beginning. They have tragic memories, but also wonderful stories to tell about a cause bigger than themselves.And for that reason this review of this wonderful film is dedicated to a gay rights pioneer whom I knew and who recently passed away. Eleanor Cooper did her activism as an emigrant from Tennessee. She dedicated her life to making the world better for her GLBT brothers and sisters for more than 30 years in New York City. She was a prime leader in the passage of New York City's gay rights law. She was unflagging optimist and never lost faith that with education and reason people would get it about us. Her optimism was infectious, buoyed many a spirit in bad times, political and personal.Harvey Milk said that he had not really done anything he was truly proud of at the age of 40 just before moving from New York to San Francisco. If he did nothing else he gave hope and encouragement to untold numbers of young gay people that you're not worthless, that you had a mission on this earth to make the best life you can for yourself and for your brothers and sisters. The best scene in the film is Milk talking to a young kid from Minnesota who was contemplating suicide and who might very well have done it as too many have.The young man's name was Paul. And this review and this film is and should also be dedicated to all the Pauls and Paulas out there who are not going to accept a second class life from ignorant people. Not any place on this globe."
Yes Man             ,fredman5555,0,comedy,2008,7,"I have to admit, I was skeptical at first. I hadn't seen a Carrey movie in awhile -- the last one was Lemony Snicket's which was not too great in my opinion, but the previews and the reviews for this looked good so I figured I'd give it a chance. I was happily surprised! Jim Carrey has improved over the years -- no doubt about it, and for a start, one thing I really liked about this movie was how he took it to a semi-serious level while managing to interject humor that, for the most part, wasn't aimed at the intelligence of the average seven year old. This movie has a plot. It has drama, and to a point, it draws you in.Carrey got rid of (well nearly) his almost constant facial contortions which had defined so many of his past movies. For this one, he relied on the personality of his character, which was placed in the potentially compromising situation of always having to say yes, to be what led the movie, and he did a good job of it.The movie was truly enjoyable overall, and you do feel sorry for his character toward the end when he has a falling-out with the leading lady (though not so sorry that you actually want to cry yourself). The emotional level of this movie is simply, ""fun."" It won't ""wow"" you! You won't leave the theater feeling like you've run the gamut of emotions yourself or anything like that, but you won't be disappointed either. You'll leave the movie smiling. Oh, and be sure you stay through the credits!All-in-all I give it a 7 of 10. The acting was believable, good but not great, and entertaining 'til the end. The premise was plausible, and the characters are pleasant to look at, but perhaps most interesting is how there really is a good lesson built in there for all of us to learn.Go ahead. Take a break from holiday shopping and enjoy this flick! You'll be happy you di"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,DICK STEEL,0,animation,2009,8,"Never did I think that The Tale of Despereaux would have all it takes to be a fairy tale in the spirit of Stardust, and I had actually found myself enjoying this tale from once upon a time, which provided entertainment to children, and not leave the adults in the lurch thanks to its rather mature story that spread out like a hydra thanks to the myriad of colourful characters inhabiting its kingdom of Dor, where citizens enjoy the yearly ritual of witnessing and subsequently tasting the soup of the year created.There's a difference between a mouse and a rat, as far as likability and the cuteness factor goes. And central to the story are a world-weary rat Roscuro (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) who lives aboard a ship and finds himself grounded in part due to his love for good food, and that of an innocent mouse with a big heart, the titular character Despereaux (Matthew Broderick), who is smaller in size than the average mouse, but born with big Dumbo like ears which he uses to great effect. Roscuro's presence in the kingdom happens to be the root cause of the king having to ban soup and outlaw the presence of rats in his kingdom, and disappears for a while in the middle section of the story, leaving room for Despereaux to step up to the central role. We learn that Despereaux is no ordinary mouse, not only in physical terms, but in character, because he knows no fear and very much unlike the other mice who must learn to be meek and cower as an innate response to danger. For his steadfastness in holding true to his principles, he finds himself banished as punishment for speaking to Princess Pea (Emma Watson), and so paves way for the little one to exhibit the values of honour, chivalry, loyalty and courage, stuff in which he found appealing from a story book that he read, with which he imagines himself to be a mouseketeer/knight.What made this movie work, are the many threads and characters in seemingly disparate narrative arcs, where you can't help but to anticipate how they would all come together. Each character created was quite balanced in having grey area to tread, so that the theme of forgiveness could ring through. And having a star studded cast to voice them worked wonders too, such as Tracey Ullman, Kevin Kline, William H. Macy, Ciaran Hinds (who is also in this week's Race to Witch Mountain), Frank Langella, Christopher Llyod and Sigourney Weaver as the narrator, which quite interestingly, doesn't always narrate verbatim to what's shown on screen. Each character has their own motivation put out clearly, and while some, like the key characters, have their work cut out for them, you can rely on the support cast to liven up things a little and provide some comic relief.I guess the animation studios in the west have already reached a plateau in terms of the technical know-how in putting out a photo-realistic animated film these days. You can imagine the texture of the animal's fur, as well as the smell of the dark and stank underground city of Rat Town, or the perfumed sweetness that comes with a princess' room. It goes to show that the benchmark has been raised permanently, and it will take many years and larger budgets if local animated film studios (that have given us cringeworthy titles to date, with poor stories and poor graphics) are thinking of reaching the same heights. Not wanting to put them down, but they have to understand that a strong story is key (and doesn't mean you tweak it to suit the flavour of what you think will sell) in order for the animation to do its part (e.g. Barnyard <U+0096> excellent CG art, but poor story = box office disaster).The Tale of Despereaux again is family friendly fare save for one scene which I thought might be pushing the envelope a bit (for a children's G-rated film that is). Other than that, for those looking for a more adult fairy tale, give this mouse a chance, and in all honesty, this little guy got more spunk than Ratatouille. Recommende"
The Incredible Hulk             ,femaleanimefan,0,action,2008,9,"I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. Ang Lee's version didn't please me at all. It didn't have enough action and it had far too much dialogue. I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.I also must say the cast is a lot better this time around. Edward Norton is far more convincing as Bruce Banner than Eric Bana was. Liv Tyler does a good job as Betty, Bruce's girlfriend, though I do like Jennifer Connelly a bit more. The supporting cast is also great, and they all deserve to at least be nominated for some awards. My favorite performance is tied between Norton and Tim Roth.Now, to the special effects. Predictably, they are magnificent. With recent superhero movies, the effects are always brilliant, and they certainly adapted the Hulk character more closely to the original comics from what I've heard. The action scenes are cool and fun to watch, and fans of the comic books will be on the edge of their seat in excitement.All in all, it's a great movie that comic fans should enjoy, and even if you don't really read them, you'll still like the movie, as I did. While it's not my favorite superhero movie, it is a whole lot better than Ang Lee's version, and a fun time at the theater. 2"
Igor             ,miami92,0,animation,2008,7,"I absolutely loved John Cusack and Sean Hayes performances in this film. The digital animation was splendid. Great to hear Arsenio in the film. Jennifer Coolidge caught my attention. Her performance was colorful and was executed masterfully. I do feel the film is directed at adults and older children, even though younger children will love the visual surroundings in this animated film. They may not understand much of the actual banter in the film, but the characters are definitely out there and really easy to mesh with.In conclusion, I think although this film is not the best film I have seen, it does draw in the audience with the brilliant performances by the cast, and the sheer genius of the animatio"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,seawalker,1,misc,2008,8,"Going into see ""Der Baader Meinhof Komplex"" I was filled with trepidation. This was a long German film, with subtitles, by a very serious Director, dealing with the potentially tortuous subject of politics, the radicalisation of students in the late 1960's and the myriad gangs, brigades and groups that came out of that period. Not knowing an awful lot about the German political scene of that time, I was worried that I would struggle to understand it all.No worries on that front. It is a tribute to director Uli Edel and writer Bernd Eichinger that the story of the Baader-Meinholf gang was presented cleanly and clearly. I thought that ""Der Baader Meinhof Komplex"" was a beautifully constructed, visceral movie, with note perfect performances from the main leads: Moritz Bleibtreu's Andreas Baader - egotistical, irresponsible, charismatic and, let's be honest for a moment, a bit of a horse's ass; Martina Gedeck's Ulrike Meinhof - a faintly left leaning journalist, intelligent, thoughtful, introspective, somewhat seduced by the glamour of the 'movement' and Johanna Wokalek's Gudrun Ensslin - Baader's girlfriend, obsessed, twinkly eyed, dedicated and ruthless. All outstanding.Interestingly, the movie does not judge. You see the position of the group, and of the authorities that battled them, equally. The quality of the movie and of the performances is such that that you do feel a degree of sympathy for the 'terrorists' as their plans fail, their members are picked off one by one and their mental state starts to unravel. You feel sympathy, despite the fact that they were bombers, kidnappers and murderers.I do feel that ""Der Baader Meinhof Komplex"" was a tad too long. The second half of the movie, dealing with the incarceration of the senior members of the group, could possibly have been tighter, but I am just being picky. ""Der Baader Meinhof Komplex"" was an extremely good movie. I think that it is one of the best of the year.(And shame on the two people who left after 5 minutes, no doubt distressed by the fact that they had accidentally paid to see a foreign film with - whisper it! - subtitles. The horror! I nearly called out to them that ""High School Musical 3"" was on next door and that maybe they should try that film instead. Very sad. They do not know what they missed.)"
The Lucky Ones             ,prodbabies,,adventure,2008,6,"So I made the trip out to one of the limited theaters showing ""The Lucky Ones"" which I wanted to see because of the cast. The acting is fine but the film looks and feels rather low budget. While the cast did a good job with the performances, they would have appeared better had the film been directed and edited better. I suspect it was more the director issue and that the editor did not have much ""coverage"" on each seen to cut any better. Many of the pivotal scenes for each character do not pay off (especially early scenes) as tension did not build. The action or reaction to the circumstances seems to play out slow. Most of the movie has limited camera angles and cuts. Added to this is the fact that music is not used much in the film (maybe budget did not allow for it) and this may be one of the reasons many scenes lack impact. The story was mediocre. It tried to give depth and layers to the characters but seems shortened. Finally, some scenes appear grainy as though shot in 16mm.All this said, the performances of the three leads were good and are enough to win you over and leave you feeling as though you saw a decent low budget film. Far from a great film (I would not travel too far to see it) but its worth a view especially if you wait till DVD"
35 Shots of Rum             ,FilmCriticLalitRao,0,drama,2013,NA,"Loneliness is a strange feeling as one can be lonely even while being surrounded by huge armies of people. 35 shots of Rum appears to celebrate loneliness as it allows its protagonists to explore their inner world where loneliness is an expression of their choice which they use in order to reveal their strengths and weaknesses. This film is a sensible study which highlights the strengths and weaknesses of human character. This study is carried out through the depiction of human life's most ordinary moments namely a woman buying a rice cooker, a car getting stuck during a rainy season etc. 35 shots of rum is balanced in his approach as loneliness has also been depicted as a life threatening sentiment which claims numerous victims. One such victim dies after having been viciously attacked by fate. French director Claire Denis chose to depict a quiet yet fragile daughter/father relationship which is not able to stand the test of time. This is shown in the form of cracks which begin to slowly destroy an innocent daughter/father relationship when both of them choose to part in order to be with their loved one"
Deception             ,kosmasp,0,crime,2008,3,"Is this the first thriller you have ever watched? Then you might be entertained a bit. If you have watched a few, you will not only see every twist and plot point coming before the screen writer had thought of it, but you will be able to guess the ending too ... Well actually you might be better off, watching the trailer, because there is not really anything good in the movie other than that. Because, erotic this one ain't. Not even suspenseful or anything like that ...What is a saving grace then? Well if you will the actors. Although they are pretty stiff here too. But they have that B-movie appeal to them, a bit trashy actually. The so called ""erotic"" Scenes are only worth mentioning, for being anything, but that or even sensual! Although the montage is so trashy, that it's actually a bit fun (in a trashy way). The ending alone deserves a 2 out of 10 vote ... that is if you aren't actually too harsh towards it! Rather watch ""Basic Instinct"" again, if you want an erotic thriller ... heck even the second Basic Instinct has something going for it (if you count the trash factor in!). Anyway, just in case I wasn't clear enough: I wouldn't recommend watching this"
The Incredible Hulk             ,rama-28,0,action,2008,10,"Take a deep breath when you enter the cinema to see this one because it's just downright breathtaking. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an amazing summer blockbuster movie. This reboot has made Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 seem like it never existed. Edward Norton's version portrays what Hulk is supposed to be<U+0085> on the big screen. Do not bootleg this one, do not wait til it hit DVD, Go watch it in the theaters because I guarantee you it is worth every penny. This movie is spectacular and superb in every way. It's a rock 'em smash 'em, jaw dropping thrill ride.Let's just start with the acting, what a perfect cast ensemble. Edward Norton is a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana because Edward looks more convincing as a skinny nerd scientist. He embodies the pain and the struggle that his character has to go through. Always running, always hiding, always trying to come up with ways to get rid of the monster in him. William Hurt and Tim Roth have no problem being the bad guys, having played so many other bad guys in many other movies in the past. Tim Blake Nelson giving us hints that he'll become the next arch nemesis The Leader is pretty cool. Liv Tyler is so damn cute. That girl can melt your heart.Now to the best part. The category that makes this movie a winner is its awesome CGI visual effects. Bravo to the brains behind this brilliant technological accomplishment. When Hulk breaks a cop car into half and uses each part as boxing globes, that's just plain badass! The images are so much better and more believable,.. the timing could not have been more right to revamp this character. The storyline helps us understand the characters and their development as they progress but it wastes no time at all on any boring moment.Magnificent stuntwork as well, especially the chase scene in the small town in Brazil. The whole jumping from one roof to another at high speed with bodies bumping into walls or falling down from a considerable height. I have much respect for the stunt people who broke their bones daily for this movie.The story has three main long action packed sequences and the last fight scene is just phenomenal. They weren't kidding when they said that it would last for 26 minutes. Hulk punches Abomination, Abomination, kicks Hulk, Hulk strangles Abomination, Abomination slams Hulk onto a couple of buildings.. Your inner kid will be happy.All the elements of this movie have but one purpose only<U+0085> to entertain your senses to the fullest extent. Your sight and hearing will be treated with the utmost incredible experience of your lifetime. You will find yourself cheering at how great this movie is.The cameo by Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, who plays Hulk in the old TV series are memorable. The plot also has some punch lines here and there that are silly funny but effective. I'm glad Lou Ferrigno got to voice the Hulk because I can't think of anyone else more perfect for the job. The movie even includes the main theme song from the old TV series starring the late Bill Bixby. What a heartfelt nostalgic tribute.The teaser at the end when Tony Stark meets Gen. Thunderbolt Ross, that part is a show stopper. Director Louise Leterrier and his crew deserves a standing ovation for successfully making an excellent superhero movie which some people thought was going to be as bad as the first Hulk movie. Well, Louise has proved them wrong. Summer 2008 may quite possibly be the best summer movie season ever. 1"
Wendy and Lucy             ,blanbrn,1,drama,2009,6,"This indie picture ""Wendy and Lucy"" has in some sense a close resemblance to ""Into the Wild"", yet her the lead character is not as fortunate nor does the character experience good bonding friendship along her journey of hardship as ""Into the Wild"" was more of a discovery film and the lead was a male gender. Still this film will have you feeling sorry for it's lead as it shows just how bad life can be for some people as obstacle after obstacle can come up along their journey of life.Michelle Williams(in one of her most unattractive roles) is Wendy a young Indiana woman who's became a loner and drifter and she's set out on her own to start a new life and journey. Wendy has only two things left to live for that's her loving sidekick a dog named Lucy and it's her journey and dream to make it to Alaska and work at a fishery. Along the way she gets stuck in the Pacific Northwest as this is where the film starts to twist with hardship and it emotionally and vividly shows how a journey of life can be a struggle with uncertainty and loneliness. It all starts as Wendy who's already cash strapped and broke has her car break down, as she has to drift and search for help. Conflict is the norm along the way from her getting caught shoplifting to having a tough time fitting in and making friends with the townspeople. Then to top off all the trouble she's separated from her dog Lucy on the roadsides.All from then on one can see from the direction that this film goes it shows that no matter how much you want a journey of escape, when your forced into a world of no income, friends, or transportation you fall into the limits of the world at hand and no one will feel the duty to help you in troubled times. Overall ""Wendy and Lucy"" is one of those films that you will leave feeling sympathetic for the lead character yet it will teach you a lesson that without resources and connections the journey of life and your traveling destination becomes harsh almost impossible and as you see in the films end before you reach your new discovery destination you most likely have to give up your most precious bonding friend. As in life during a travel of journey you learn every time you leave somewhere or someon"
Summer Hours             ,shatguintruo,1,drama,2010,9,"What really caught my attention in this movie is the phrase spoken by the family's maid (Heloise) after the death of Helen (the matriarch Family) ""What would I do with a work of art?"" It seems that this sentence is intentional and has scope for tinkering with the head of the spectator; ""What to do with a work of art?"" Imagine: If Frederic Chopin heaved kept until nowadays all his compositions, just for his own pleasure, just for his family pleasure and just for his friends pleasure ... Do you imagine? Mutatis mutandis a work of art, be a mobile, a painting or a sculpture can not be kept ""for my eyes only"" and those should be shown for all the world see ... And one more question: - Can ""the classic"" be put side to side with ""the modern""?Indeed, in several scenes of that movie, there is always the ""modern"" counterpointing to the ""classic"", for example: in the kitchen of the ""centennial maison"" there is a refrigerator; in the paths that lead to the ""maison"" no more ""coaches"" are seen, but modern cars; the characters indulge themselves with wine glasses, just as their ancestors did. As for cinematography, they remembered me several paintings by Renoir, extracting all its bucolic landscape ... Juliette Binoche - no surprise - masterfully composed his character: modern woman (just as Hélène) who practically lives for his work and ""running"" for several countries ... La France (toujours La France...) gives us this wonderful movie to be tasted ""doucement"" as a ""Gran Crú Classée"" deserves ... On a scale of 0 to 10, classify the film score of "

Death Race             ,dino_saur333,0,action,2008,8,"I always hate it when all those high class critics from the newspapers and journals bash a film for not being what THEY want it to be and not looking at it for what its SUPPOSED to be.The title is ""Death Race"" after all. No-one ever expected it to win any golden trophies in the first place. So what if the acting was a bit bland and the plot was a little weak. That's not was the movie is supposed th be about.It's not a Martin Scorsese film where you sit back and think ""Oh, that is very thought-provoking and I feel that I've truly learned something inspirational today."" No. This is a film where you sit back, look at it, and think ""Holy ****!! Did you see that ********** explosion?!""This is a film where you have fun in.

The Merry Gentleman             ,Quinoa1984,,crime,2009,7,"The Merry Gentlemen has the makings, and perhaps even the trappings, of a predictable neo-noir involving a hit-man (Michael Keaton), a detective (Bastounes) and the woman that they're both eying (Kelly MacDonald), and the elements of crime floating all about. But Keaton brings to the table as a first-time director an absolutely unbreakable grasp of what makes the scene(s) work from an actor's stand-point. Ironically for an actor who usually makes his mark in movies as someone with a lot of nervous energy or something that makes him quirky or mysterious (i.e. Batman/Bruce Wayne, Beetlejuice, Jackie Brown), here he's subdued, almost like Alain Deleon in Melville's movies. He doesn't say much, but when he does you listen, especially as his character Logan has pneumonia or carries a Christmas tree.On his own end Keaton's got his character covered wonderfully. That leaves the other two, and one other actor that should be noted. MacDonald is quickly becoming an example of a perfect character actress. It's hard for me to see her becoming a full-blown A-list star, even a decade or more after she hit the scene in her debut in Trainspotting, but when she comes into a role, usually in the supporting variety (most recently No Country for Old Men and Choke) you feel her presence incredibly. She's so vulnerable and adorable, so keen on how her character should be in every moment, as someone who's fragile, been messed with by her husband, but wants to have her space while at the same time being friendly to both the lonely hit-man and the desperate cop. It's hard for me to see a flaw in her performance, and maybe helps elevate things another notch or two. Ditto for Bastounes, one of those actors you swear you've seen somewhere else but actually has only been in one (or none) features before this. He, too, makes a mark playing off both MacDonald like at the restaurant or Keaton in a pivotal scene at the tailor.There's another actor I should also credit, though at the moment I forget his name: he plays MacDonald's character's husband, and he appears out of the darkness in a scene, a recovering abuser with a newfound Jesus addiction who tries to win back his wife's heart as she holds a knife to him. It's one of the best, creepiest dramatic scenes I've yet seen this year. And while I praise his and the other principles performances, the rest of the film around them is... well, good, watchable, though nothing wholly remarkable. At times Keaton is still finding his footing with style, keeping some shots engaging and others just doing a big pan or reveal where it wouldn't be necessary. It's competent work, though, and I would hope to see something else from him; at the least he reveals himself such a fantastic director of his fellow actors (not least of which himself, though as Eastwood shows that's easier done than said) that he may have found a new calling. It's an A-grade acting job amid a decent little B-movie. 7.5/10"
Kisses             ,Nighthawk1,1,drama,2010,NA,"An excellent movie even. Even with a short 75 minute running the movie is crafted and developed impressively. Not a feel good movie in the slightest. It is the story of two Irish runaway children that come from abusive homes. It is unabashedly forthright in its hopeless outlook on life in general. The subject matter of the movie is undeniably grim and pessimistic, but this is a great example of superb minimalist film making. Nothing is overdone or excessive. Everything on screen seems to be needed and no time or scene is wasted for any reason. This movie will satisfy fans of art house and foreign film. Some people will be put off by it due to its subject matter but others who appreciate this kind of movie will definitely want to go see i"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,Dragoneyed363,0,animation,2008,9,"I was really excited about seeing the sequel to Madagascar, because I really loved the first and thought it was one of the best animations of the decade, regardless of how underrated it is, and this looked just as good, and in my opinion it almost was. Both of them are excellent films that are nothing but fun and are super energetic from the moment they come on screen, and this just made me appreciate the first even more than I already did, and am even looking forward to a third installment. The quality of this film might seem more fast paced and careless, but it is just as lovable. When it started up, I was immediately sucked in, and I never became uninterested and it never stopped entertaining, because they did an excellent job at keeping your attention just like the first. There were some parts in the movie where I felt as if they tried too hard to please the audience and then others it got a little dumb and boring, but overall I laughed insanely and was very pleased. When it was over I wanted to watch it again. It's a great sequel to a great movie and I enjoyed watching it as much as the first, as I have said. Some hilarious scenes like the plane crash, any scene with Moto Moto and of course Mort are lovable too. It's story is touching and fantastic as well, go see it."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,YoSafBridge,1,misc,2008,5,"All and all, not a particularly enjoyable film.This movie sacrifices all that was interesting about the novel in the first place just to squeeze in all the historical aspects. All of the page turning scenes in the book that would have been interesting to see translated to screen (Anne's bloodstained dress, the deformed child, the courtship between Mary and William) were cut.Fortuanatly, I expected that. With such a long book, I had to expect most of my favourite scenes were going to get the axe.What I didn't expect was for the narration to change from that of Mary (aka. ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" for which the book was named) to yet another story about Anne Boelyn. The film started off well, if rather slow, with the story being told from Mary, but it quickly changes gears as the audience is suddenly following Anne's courtship of Henry and Anne's trials, emotions and desperation. Mary is quickly delegated to little more then a secondary role, with many key moments happening while she isn't on screen.The story of Anne was told well, she was portrayed brilliantly by Portman, and had several fun and emotional moments. But that's just the problem, I've seen that all before. There have been dozens of films, series, and books written from Anne's point of view. If I wanted to see a story about Anne, I would have watched Anne of the Thousand Days or maybe ""The Tudors"" HBO series. What made this story special was it told the story behind Anne and Henry (and it was mostly fictional which added to the drama). Unfortunately the movie ignored this, and thus failed to create the same reaction I had towards the book. Another problem is that of characterisation, I expected that the movie would make the two sisters friends as it creates more drama towards the end as opposed to them being not particularly close like in the book. Same with the enormous changes they made in the personalities of the parents (and honestly, almost every character)I expected it. Many of the characters in the movie were actually more two-dimensional then the callous characters from the book. It wasn't as though this movie was badly acted or written...it was just bad.The person I was most disappointed about was George (one of my favourites in the book) who was given a woefully small role, although the actor who portrayed him did it brilliantly. Also, The character of William Stafford seemed to be added in as an afterthought which confused the audience who hadn't read the book (the two main questions I heard were ""Is that the guy she married in the beginning"" or ""What happened to the guy she married in the beginning"") and left those of us who had read the book wondering why he was portrayed as such a pansy?And the editing, where to begin. Horrible, the particularly poignant scenes (few and far between as they were) were not given enough time to sink in before the audience was whisked off to another scene. Even having read the source material I was lost, so I can only imagine how it must have been from those new to the story. The only bright side of this tedious film were the beautiful costumes, but even the bright colours and swirly dresses couldn't distract anyone with more then a 10 second attention span and despite them the movie soon became unbearably boring.All in all, this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place. It was apparent there was too much story to tell in two hours, it had mini-series written all over it. But seeing as it had to be made for the film industry to cash in the the books success, it could have been done a lot better."
Garden Party             ,vince_cadena,1,drama,2009,NA,"I saw this movie basically because I think that Willa Holland is an incredibly lovely young model/actress. I won't give away too much of the plot except to say this is a rip off of P.T. Anderson, Brett Easton Ellis, Mulholland Dr and throw in The OC just because the filmmakers have little imagination an originality of their own. I mean there's not much to give away there aren't any big plot twists. It just occurred to me that if Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around this would be the perfect movie for them to goof on. This film is about a group of people living in Los Angeles, some of them prostitute themselves, others sell real estate an marijuana, some are musicians and some do nothing. I mean this movie is hilariously bad at times, one of the characters is suppose to be an amazing badass rocker and he makes the Jonas brothers look cool. So like I said in my summary kind of a typical bad straight to video movie, weak acting, direction, cinematography etc. What really gave this movie character is the bad script, it's just so laughable it almost and I repeat almost makes this entertaining in a bad way. It's funny to think that the lead actress worked with Stanley Kubrick and Vinessa Shaw is a good actress, when given the right material. Willa Holland is cute but I can see her doing many more movies like this. Probably the best thing about this confusing movie was the genuinely funny agent, sure the guy is just ripping off Dane Cook and Jeremy Piven but it's not like those two are Deniro or Jim Carrey for that matter. See this movie if you're with some friends and you want to make your own Mystery Science Theater 3000"
Shutter             ,valleyjohn,0,horror,2008,3,"Why do i do it? I keep complaining about these Asian remakes yet i keep watching them . Maybe i do it so you don't have to , maybe it's because I'm sadistic or maybe I'm just waiting for there to be one that's any good? Whatever the reason one thing that i know is true is that Shutter is worst i have seen yet. For photographer Ben and his new wife Jane , his new assignment -- a lucrative fashion shoot in Tokyo -- was supposed to be a kind of working honeymoon. Ben and Jane arrive in Japan. But as they make their way on a mountain road leading to Mt. Fuji, their new life together comes to, literally, a crashing halt. Their car smashes into a woman standing in the middle of the road, who has materialised out of nowhere. Upon regaining consciousness after the accident, but they cannot find any trace of the girl . Shaken by the accident and by the girl's disappearance, they arrive in Tokyo, where Ben begins his glamorous assignment. Having worked in Japan before and fluent in the language, Ben is comfortable there, and he eagerly reunites with old friends and colleagues. Jane feels very much like a stranger in a strange land as she makes tentative, unsettling forays through the city. Ben, meanwhile, has discovered mysterious white blurs , evocative of a human form , that have materialised on an entire day's work from the expensive photo shoot. Jane's concerns escalate as she believes the blurs in Ben's photos are the dead girl from the road, who is now seeking vengeance for them leaving her to die... Without watching Shutter you already know the format. Spirits that have pasty faces and fail to recognise the value of the slogan ""rest in peace. Shutter is also another ""ghost in the machine"" story, except this time the machine is a camera.The trouble is there is absolutely nothing scary about this movie . There is plenty of bangs and crashes and you are bombarded with noise but nothing at all visual that would remotely send a chill down the spine. There is one scene that i liked where the screen went black every few seconds as to imitate the flash of a camera but that is all i cant think of that i can say is good about this film.The acting is irrelevant because the film is so dull . Fans of The American Office and Heroes might recognise a couple of the cast.This is the first Asian remake i have seen that hails from from Thailand but it is still the same old dross that has been dished up over the last couple of years . Director Masayuki Ochiai has failed miserably to achieve anything worth while and it's a film that will fade from the memory very fast indeed.The PG-13 rating says it all, while opening the gates to bored teenagers it will turn hardcore horror aficionados in the other direction.I don't know about you but i want my Horror movies to be 18 rated and nothing less.3 out of 10"
Pathology             ,jaggedrengen,1,crime,2008,3,"This movie was so bad that I just had to register on IMDb to set things straight. For the most I trust the average rating here. Seems to be correct but this one was off.Now the movie was quite a disappointment. To me its a designer movie that did swap a real story for some macabre scenes. The plot is so thin, and if you start to think about the storyline for just a second, then it all falls apart.The whole idea of these ""rogue"" doctors that get high on playing with murder and corpses is a joke. It just doesn't make sense. They are all incredible childish, the dialog is like children trying to talk each other into stupid stuff just by using the apparently magic sentence "" I dare you ""....So just by saying ""I dare you"" the leading character showes his promising career down the drain with eyes wide open. Its so thin, boring and predictable that its a mystery to me how this movie got the rating it got here."
The Lucky Ones             ,ledpenny,,adventure,2011,NA,"Here you have three people, no dramatic problems, stuck in an airport. They, strangers to each other, join in a trip across from the East to the Midwest. Ho hum. Oh, wait, Tim Robbins is in it, OK, give it 6 minutes. Then, this believable trio display the best part of human life...empathy. You fantasize, in somber spirit, that humans are like these three. The movie comes to a quiet, completed end, and you love each character and find yourself hoping they have a good life, because they are no longer Tim Robbins, Mike Pena, and Rachel McAdams, the actors. The ""public"" that they navigate around seem always insincere with their 'thank you for serving', although in real life, past returning veterans were treated with total disdain.

The Duchess             ,Otoboke,1,misc,2008,NA,"The period drama never has been a genre that has offered cinema attendees high octane thrills and pacing, instead opting for a much more subdued, elegant formula to tell whatever historically placed story it may be willing to explore. To say that much of the genre as a result is usually unfairly deemed as dry to the point of uselessness would be somewhat of an understatement; in fact the vast majority of such films, although slow and exceedingly dry, usually make up for their blandness in story with well rounded, memorable and exciting characters. The Duchess however, is not one of these films. No, this is dry turkey with an ostensible glaze created by superficial juice. Going through the motions at every turn, director Saul Dibb fails to create anything worth noting here; it's an extremely straight-forward, standardised period drama with little to no interesting characters whatsoever. So not only do you have to sit through a soap opera plot that feels about as fresh and exciting as seeing Keira Knightley in another period costume, but you have to do so with inane personas that never do anything but pamper about in their big mansions, shouting at their servants. Dull, dreary and utterly disposable, The Duchess is as boring as the genre gets, and while there are some good elements present, they fail to mesh coherently to disguise the fact that the script has no intrinsic value inherent in its thin, formulaic design.To discuss the premise of the movie is almost futile; if you have seen any movies from the genre, you have pretty much seen The Duchess. Revolving around yet another privileged woman who in turn marries a man of prestige and obviously finds out he is interested in her only for the chance to birth an heir, the twists and turns that take place here are stunted and all too obvious. Throw in the ambitious dreamer that whisks the duchess to her dream fantasy land where the sex is just so much better because, well, he's rugged and a little more emotionally viable, and you can see that not much out of the ordinary is set to take place over the next couple of hours. At this point in discussing the story I would normally diverge onto something that works a little better, and yet I can find no opposing tangent to bring up here. Aside from the happy error of making the film's quietened antagonist more empathetic and compelling than the lead woman, The Duchess is straight forward, no risks involved, period drama; all the staples are here and yet never before have they all felt so lifeless, tired and irrelevant.Indeed, in order for such a film to work, one must bridge the massive gap that separates the culture of today with that on the screen. Many of the most memorable movies residing within the genre have managed to do this, but The Duchess never does. Sure enough, the script does well to put character and themes of love and regret in the forefront of focus in order to tell a story of humanity rather than history, yet in direct contrast with this year's much more engaging The Other Boleyn Girl, this outing feels emotionally mundane. Lead actress Keira Knightley is no stranger to these types of features, but unfortunately her whole performance this time feels perfunctory and useless; her character is ruled by emotion to that the point that she is perceived as weak and without reasoning. When you have a central character who asks for sympathy in every scene without doing anything to warrant such a thing, you have a troublesome predicament. As a personality The Duchess of Devonshire is banal and the antithesis of compelling. She never surprises and shows less personality than in her ridiculously fake beauty spot that she sports in one scene. During this sequence I was enraptured by this giant obstruction on Keira's face, and then I remembered where I was. To scream irony at this point would have been befitting.To be sure, there are audiences out there who will eat up this sort of thing for what it is; cheap, seen-it-all-before drama that demands little and offers not much more in exchange. Behind me sat two older women, both of whom I deemed aficionados of the genre going by their hoots and wails during certain scenes that tickled their fancy. Sure enough, I would guess that they at least were entertained, yet I was not. Again, I blame culture difference. And yet with major worldwide successes this year from the likes of Iron Man, Indiana Jones and Batman, one wonders if the period drama will ever manage to draw in the demographic that such movies have thus far managed to do. Going by The Duchess however, which prompts one to believe that things are only getting worse for a genre that is by now churning out the same story time and time again, this potentiality seems unlikely. Perhaps if the historical setting and themes present here were delivered with more poignancy and an overall conviction or sense of modern relevancy, The Duchess could have at least dispelled my apathy towards the genre by the likes of The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately this is not the case; esoteric and emotionally stunted, this movie is too hard to get into, and all too easy to walk out of; only for those who haven't seen a period drama in the last five years.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
Saw V             ,jesse_hitz,0,crime,2008,6,"Just got back from seeing the new saw tonight and i must say i was a little surprised. The Saw franchise has officially been run into the ground ever since saw 2, so you either really need to be a fan of the series or go in knowing all the saw movies and having an open mind. Knowing that this was probably just a milk the cow and grab the cash type of deal i was a little surprised. This saw film is different from all the others, it returns a little to its original roots.Much like the first saw this time around we are given more story and little on the deaths and traps. This movie seems more of a detective thriller than a gore slash em up type of movie however that still is present. The movie also moves at a slower pace. So here is my rundown of the film.The death traps to me seemed very unoriginal but i guess thats kind of hard when you have probably used them all, and overall that sadistic feeling is just gone now. The story continues where saw 4 left off and pretty much really stays the same nothing new really happens. The viewer may get more story but it's really unnecessary. The only new things we learn is how that detective came to work along side jigsaw. We learn nothing new about jigsaw or his past like we were promised. Also again his wife is left with nothing new other than a box with something in it that we don't get to see or hear from again...probably till saw 6. So overall the traps are kind of boring and have been done, you also get cheated out of some, the story is quite pointless, and the ending is....The ending is well the tagline reads ""You won't believe how it ends"" well guess what i can believe how it ended and all i'll say was wow it is nothing excellent or twisted. Just open ended no surprise or nothing unlike the other saw films, but maybe it's just setting up for the final act so there is no need to bring in other killers or major twists like the last saw films. Overall the movie was alright not great but probably more worth watching when it comes to DVD or blu-ray. Saw fans will probably either love this or even shrug it off because of its slower pace. For people who haven't seen all the saw's will want to avoid this one because of the constant flashback's and confusing story line.Best saw films overall: -Saw -Saw 3 -Saw 2 -Saw 4 -Saw 5"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,s_garoutte,0,animation,2008,8,"My son and I read this book last year and it along with Kate's other great work ""The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane"" we enjoyed very much. It is rare to find witty educated authors who are able to identify with the 5-10yr old crowd. The movie however was a far cry from the book, nevertheless the family and I enjoyed it very much. I am personally tired of the movies that focus on the parents more and the kids less (Bolt, The Incredibles etc..). The movie is a great movie particularly if you want to have a great talk with the kids on the way home about honor and bravery. Was it the book? No and I prefer the book, but the movie is good entertainment in it's own right. Give it a chance, it will touch you."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,Liedzeit,1,misc,2008,8,"First of all this is a very important film. Just like the other ""Big"" film by Eichinger ""Der Untergang"" it confronts the German audience (and the world should it care) with some aspect of German history that people should know about. In this case the ""myth"" of the RAF. To everyone who lived through the seventies in Germany it is clear that the influence of the RAF on Germany can hardly be exaggerated. I was a kid but my impression at the time was that both sides were wrong. There was a constant fear of terror coming from the terrorists but also from the state. (People did not get jobs if it was suspected they were ""left"".) So to make a blockbuster film, even if it does not really explain the motives of the main characters involved, at least gives us some facts. Not everyone is prepared to watch documentaries or read the book by Aust, but everyone should have some thoughts or maybe discussions on the subject. Okay, but does it succeed as a film? Not entirely. The actors as everyone agrees were excellent, the cinematography as well. You do think you are in the seventies. That in itself is amazing. The action scenes are done splendidly, especially at the beginning the riots during the visit of the Persian Shah which culminated in the shooting of a student which in turn was, at least to some extent, the origin of the rise of terror. Of course the film is episodic and there are too many characters in it, most of them are not introduced in any way and ten years of complex history cannot be told in an altogether satisfying way. But the film succeeds in giving us a sense of what was going on. The producer, Bernd Eichinger has been accused of vanity. Which is a funny thing. Of course, he is vain. He has the duty to be vain as long as he also feels a responsibility to make movies that try to tell something. And the challenge, he feels, is to say it to as many people as possible. "
The Reader             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,drama,2009,10,"Kate Winslet, I absolutely adore her, she's my favorite actress of all time. I still can't believe that she hadn't won an Oscar, her first nomination was in 1995 with Sense and Sensibility. Finally after 14 long years, she finally won the coveted award with the movie The Reader. I finally was able to see this movie the other day and it blew me away, I'm still debating if this really was my favorite Kate Winslet performance, but once again with a strong cast telling a powerful story, The Reader was definitely one of the best films out of 2008. So many holocaust films have been made, it's hard to make another that stands out, but we really haven't had a story where the Nazi guards were on trial. A lot of people debate if this movie is trying too hard to push sympathy on Kate Winslet's character, but my love for this film is to just show that they were human as well, hard to believe, but that our mothers, sisters, friends, whoever could have done something so shameful.Michael Berg in 1995 Berlin watches an S-Bahn pass by, flashing back to a tram in 1958 Neustadt. A teenage Michael gets off because he is feeling sick and wanders around the streets afterwards, finally pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz, the tram conductor, comes in and assists him in returning home. The 36 year old Hanna seduces and begins an affair with the 15 year old boy. During their liaisons, at her apartment, he reads to her literary works he is studying. After a bicycling trip, Hanna learns she is being promoted to a clerical job at the tram company. She abruptly moves without leaving a trace. The adult Michael, a lawyer, at Heidelberg University law school in 1966. As part of a special seminar taught by Professor Rohl, a camp survivor, he observes a trial of several women who were accused of letting 300 Jewish women die in a burning church when they were SS guards on the death march following the 1944 evacuation of Auschwitz. Hanna is one of the defendants. Stunned, Michael visits a former camp himself. The trial divides the seminar, with one student angrily saying there is nothing to be learned from it other than that evil acts occurred and that the older generation of Germans should kill themselves for their failure to act then. But Michael is conflicted on what to do, if to speak out on Hannah's behalf on some of her innocence in the murders or keep quiet. This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen, it was so incredible and just heart breaking. One of the things I respected about the film was the way they handled the awkward ""love story"" between Michael and Hannah, she's older, he's younger, but it's not even a perverted thing, so strange to say that. I don't know how to put it exactly, but their connection was real and in some sense they both needed each other. If you have the chance to see this movie, I seriously suggest that you take it, the powerful performances really make this film captivating. The story is so heart wrenching and painful, but was told so well. Kate now finally has the award she's deserved for so long and pulls in a terrific performance with The Reader.10/10 "
The Objective             ,thinker1691,,horror,2010,5,"Every country in the world has a collected storehouse of stories involving Ghosts, Goblins and things which go bump in the night. In the far East, from the tall rugged mountains of Afghanistan, comes this legendary tale of violent death which re-surfaced in the 21st century. The movie is called "" Objective "" and tentatively based on the legendary incident, concerning one Dr. William Brydon otherwise known as 'The Massacre at Khourd Caboul.' writer/Director Daniel Myrick tells the story of a C.I.A. operative, Benjamin Keynes (Jonas Ball) who is given a covert assignment to venture into the mountains of Afganistan and find a mystic leader named Mohammad Aban who possess special information concerning the area. Accompanying him will be an elite military team, led by Chief Warrant Officer Wally Hamer (Matt Anderson) and a local guide named Abdul (Chems Zinoune). What begins as a routine reckon mission to find and deliver a mystic leader, develops into a mysterious search, destroy and survive encounter with an ancient, but very powerful stellar phenomenon. The movie endeavors to enthrall an audience with crude scenes imitating 'Close Encounters and Predator. With a stiff narration and a poor story-line, the cast tries its best but fails on several levels. Still, it is an interesting movie, if one doesn't expect too much. I would have thought the original story of the British Massacre would have been a better investment. ***"
I Sell the Dead             ,DarkAnnie,,misc,2009,9,"I just saw this at SIFF, and I absolutely loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath. The script and direction by Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can't wait to see more from this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns in a fantastic performance (as usual) as a less-than-sympathetic jailhouse priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he balances menace and humor perfectly.This is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since Vincent Price did ""Comedy of Terrors,"" ""The Raven,"" and ""Theater of Blood."" The movie is genuinely scary in places, then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time.I can only afford to see three movies at SIFF this year, but even if the other two are awful, ""I Sell The Dead"" was worth the price of all three. I'm going to be looking for more movies from Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix. He's giving the horror genre a much-needed kick in the butt."
The Brothers Bloom             ,nisamtu,1,action,2009,1,"A pile of pompous, pretentious c**p. Oh, wait, it must be ""artistic"" then. There is no story as such, just some lame, shallow claim that two brothers are con-men. The only evidence of which is at the beginning of the movie when we are subjected to a long and lame story how they tricked some kids out of $30. Those painfully boring 10 min are supposed to be intro to the story, and to set suspense into character building... It does that, because it prepares you for the rest of incredibly shallow, stupid and devoid of any logic ""creation"" (can't really bring myself to call it a movie). This thing doesn't have a story. The writer is not intelligent and/or educated enough to put together more than 3 sentences that relate to each other. Oh, wait, then it must be ""art"", right. As for characters, most cartoons have more believable and explainable characters. It all goes something like this: ""he is a con men... never mind how and why, just go with it because I say so, I'm not clever enough to think of a good con to corroborate the story... just go with it or else I don't have a movie!"" The same applies for any other character trait you can think of. Logic and story flow... oh, wait, this ""art"", you are not suppose to have that. The mere fact that I'm mentioning those things must mean that I don't understand ""art"". This whole thing is so mind bogglingly stupid and shallow that you can just hear all those ""artists"" oooh-ing and uuuuuuh-ing about it. As for me, all I see are pathetic throws and twitches of a doped idiot who is trying to make a ""deep"" movie and is as good at it as a chronic alcoholic is at running 100m race. The mix of places, clothes, behaviour etc is another gem. The gang is going to Europe on a steamer (!) and our heroine arrives in her Lamborghini. And she lives a castle. In New Jersey. Ooooh, so deep and artistic. The trip from USA to Greece leads you pass the many snow-covered mountains. As we know, the ocean is full of them, as is the Greek coast. Our heroine is also very beautiful, incredibly rich, and lonely. As you would be, when you are young, beautiful and rich. The title suggests that the brothers last name is Bloom. Yet one is called Stephen (or something) and the other is called Bloom. So what is his full name - Bloom Bloom? Apparently it was too much of a mental effort for the writer to come up with another firs name. Oh, wait, it is artistic... The whole thing is just a slide show of mind flashes of some idiot who doesn't have enough imagination, education and life experiences to make it even mildly entertaining. Imagine your 50 year old spinster aunt showing you postcards of places she would like to have gone to and romances she would like to have had. Etc, etc, etc... one could write about how stupid this thing is for a long time. But that would be just more waste of time and life, discussing somebody's pathetic, impotent attempt to be ""creative"" and ""artistic"". Compared to this, even certified c**p like Paris Hilton movies is more entertaining and logical. Scarry thought, I know, but if you manage to sit through this pile of brown stuff as I had to, you will see what I mean."
The Dark Knight             ,SimonJack,0,action,2008,6,"Many commenters said they were ""blown away,"" so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe I'm beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I'm not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasn't (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in ""unexpecteds"" is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. I'm not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but can't agree with so many who rate this film at the top.It's good and entertaining -- but too long. It's not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I don't mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom don't have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won't be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment. 4"
The Strangers             ,NightOwl0,,horror,2008,1,"This movie starts out contrived and goes down hill from there. We see an attractive couple coming home from a social engagement. The man is sad and moody, the woman crying silently to herself. Through clumsy flashbacks we learn that the young man proposed marriage and his willowy flame said she was not ready for such a commitment. They come home, mope about for a while, almost have sex and are then terrorized by masked killers. I guess we are supposed to identify with the young couple because they are young and attractive. We have nothing else to go on because the characterization is so sketchy and lazy. Even archetypes need some sort of specificity in order to engender audience identification. The filmmaker's are proceeding from the premise that audiences don't care about character development and just want to get to the sadism. Perhaps for certain brain dead twenty somethings this will be enough. I was bored with the film from the word go. Every scene that is supposed to be suspenseful has been ripped off from another much better thriller. This film is a combination of Halloween and Scream with a little torture porn thrown in at the end for desperation's sake. The beautiful Liv Tyler is utterly wasted in a role that requires her to act like a mentally challenged five year old. A strange woman with obviously menacing intentions bangs on Tyler's door repeatedly. Instead of trying to contact the police, Tyler lights a cigarette, charges her cell phone, puts on a different outfit, calls her boyfriend on her house phone and generally behaves like a moron. It is hard to sympathize with someone who does not have one shred of a survival instinct. The killers have no motivation and stalk and kill the couple because they enjoy behaving in hateful and psychotic ways. Frankly the young couple is so useless and shallow it is hard to feel any sense of loss. The entire film is shot with hand held shaky cam techniques that the filmmaker's obviously hope will pass for a style. The only tension I felt while watching the film was a growing sense of annoyance that it was not over yet. The sense of dread and fun that is found in a masterpiece like Halloween is completely absent in this robotic-ally sadistic film. The film-making and script-writing are so lazy it is insulting. The couple is stalked and then they are killed in a brutal and obvious fashion. Somehow this process takes over an hour and a half to occur. For young audiences I suppose the payoff is the couple being killed with the stalking as some sort of foreplay. I truly do not understand the appeal of films like this. At least Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street attempted some sort of mythology. A film like this is a sad example of the limited and unimaginative fodder that passes for horror today. The only thing I really took away from this trash was a depressing feeling that what really excites people now is watching anonymous human suffering. If you are considering watching this piece of garbage I would recommend watching the artful and terrifying foreign thriller entitled ""Them."""
Frost/Nixon             ,alexmail-2,0,misc,2009,10,"I thought that Ron Howard had lost his touch after Da Vinci Code's lack of chemistry between the actors. Frost/Nixon is a whole other story.Frank Langella will most certainly be nominated for an Academy Award for his absolutely brilliant performance as Richard M. Nixon the Thirty Seventh President of the United States, and he would've won if it wasn't for Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Torino being his last. Langela becomes Nixon in the same way that Heath Ledger became the Joker. I think that Langella's accomplishment is even greater, because people knew what Nixon sounded like, people knew what Nixon was like, and Langella nails Nixon from the walk, the hunched over back, the accent, the speech pattern...everything.Michael Sheen is excellent as David Frost, a British Talk Show host, who takes the huge leap, to interview the greatest Political Criminal in American History. Sheen does an incredible job of showing the stress that Frost was under when he underwent this strenuous interview. Sheen won't win an Academy award, but he matched Langella perfectly.Kevin Bacon is very reliable again as the faithful Jack Brennan. Bacon does an excellent job of showing Brennan's loyalty to Nixon. The rest of the cast does a stellar job as well.Ron Howard is a masterful director. He makes a very conventional movie, with very basic, but brilliant shots. He does a great job of flashing ahead, and showing the ""Post Interview"" interviews. The music is very well incorporated, due to Hans Zimmers incredible score. Zimmer will get nominated for most likely his second Oscar of 2008 for this incredible score.The movie just captures the whole mood of Nixon's ""Post Watergate Life"" so well. It is almost like a biography of everything Nixon went through after he resigned the Presidency.This movie is very...very good. You might just want to see it, because of Frank Langella's chilling performance as Richard Nixon, but it also is very interesting, and extremely detailed. 10/1"
Four Christmases             ,alexanderreznikov,1,comedy,2009,1,"Just watched this movie few hours ago. It was like a shocking therapy. This has been one of the most bad movies I have ever seen. No plot, no idea, no ""healthy humor"". Only sick sex jokes and pregnancy subjects. The movie is not about Christmas: it has nothing to do with Christmas. The movie is about a girl (Witherspoon) and a guy (Vaughn): the girl finally decides that she wants to get pregnant. No use to describe movie here: those who want to watch it, don't fall asleep. I watched the movie and now regretting that I wasted two hours on that. It is not surprising: Witherspoon can't play anybody else but pregnant girls or silly lawyers; Vaughn - it is still a mystery why he agreed to do this movie. Awful. 1/10."
Kisses             ,jeroen-achterberg,1,drama,2008,NA,"Interview with Lance DalySynopsis Kisses is a road movie in which two teenagers are trying to flee from their dysfunctional home situation. The change in their life is the discovery of each other (and themselves) while wandering through Dublin (and Trollhatan). The basis for Kisses can be found in major social problems, but Lance Daly is not really appealing to a higher moral or coming up with solutions for Irish victims of abuse. The moral of the film: When you kiss, you either give or you take.Where did you find Kylie and Dylan, the lead actors in the film Kisses? LD: We have seen a lot of kids at schools, malls, etc. Finally we made a selection of 15 boys and girls and invited them for a serious screen-test. The role of Kylie was clearly for Kelly O'Neill , as she didn't need any encouragement at all. Dylan (Shane Curry) was the only one who could cope with the attitude of Kelly and after seeing the end result I think we have done a good job casting the two.Working with and directing of kids is generally experienced as very difficult and time consuming, how was that the case for Kisses? LD: Working with kids is indeed difficult and puts a strain on your endurance and mood. I had to adjust to the fact that we were not allowed to keep on filming, because the kids are protected by laws indicating they may only work so much a day. Secondly, they have a mind of their own and you just can not treat them the same as adults. This was at times frustrating, especially Kylie is very demanding and time consuming. On the other hand, Kylie and Dylan make the film and they have done a superb job. Can you elaborate some more about the title, why did you choose for 'Kisses'? LD: The title was pretty obvious for me and came up during writing the script. The film consists of several chapters and every chapter ends with a kiss. The kisses symbolize hope and love, which makes it a bit cheesy and romanticizes the film. But hey it works and closes the chapters well. There are many references to Bob Dylan, where does this fascination come from and why was it so pre-eminently in the film? LD: Well Bob Dylan is a great musician, whose music fits perfectly with the spirit of the film. The appearance of the look alike was a coincidence but also works out perfect with the accidental meeting with Kylie and Dylan.Have you considered adding English subtitles to the film as the Irish accent is difficult to understand for non Irish viewers? LD: It is funny that you ask me that question. Recently we have had this discussion back home and we just didn't know for sure. During the Q&A after the screening at festivals we have asked the audience if they would have understood the film better if there were English subtitles. Almost half of the people would have liked it and therefore I expect subtitles will be added before the theatrical release.What is the foresight for Kisses? LD: Focus Features and CAA (North America) picked up Kisses for sales and distribution. At this point the film is still showing at some festivals and around December 2008 Kisses will have its theatrical premiere in several countries.http://jeroenachterberg.blogspot.com/"
Goodbye Solo             ,asc85,0,drama,2009,3,"I just don't understand all the adulation that this film has received. I can ""get"" most arty films, and I thought ""Chop Shop,"" which was the previous film from this director was OK, but this film was a total bore, with no purpose, and characters that weren't at all interesting.As I compose this note, I'm the first person in the Comments section to say how much I disliked this movie. But at least on the IMDb message boards for this movie, I've already found a few who had the same reaction I did. So I guess there's some hope in this world. Dare I say that ""Goodbye Solo"" will be among the worst films that I will see in 2009"
Gomorrah             ,futurefeet,,crime,2011,1,"I read all kinds of glowing reviews for this when it came out, so I took my girlfriend to see it in the theater. Midway through I turned to her and whispered, ""I am so sorry!"" Holy living f**k this was boring. Please let me help you to not waste your time watching it. It's too late for me, but I can still save you! Okay, so it's basically like someone was making four or five different amateur documentaries on their camcorder. One of them follows a couple of teenage boys in some very tedious scenes while they run around, shoot guns, and break stuff. Another one involves a guy running a sweatshop. Then there's another guy who's a mobster and goes around doing mobstery things (but no interesting mobstery things, mind you). Then there's a kid who joins a gang or something (it was so mind-numbingly boring I can barely remember). So then, they splice all these unrelated things together, apparently bribe all the critics to say it's a cinematic masterpiece, and TA-DA!! Don't say I didn't warn you. Avoid this if you like movies with a bare minimum of entertainment value."
The Objective             ,automicblomme,,horror,2008,4,"I'm sorry, but I just watched this at the Atlantic film festival, and it is a horribly written, acted, and directed film.A - It's Blair Witch...AGAIN..literally B - It's Blair Witch again..overlay-ed with a rip off Charlie Sheen (in voice AND copy...well, bad copy) from Apocalypse NowThe performances were laughable, the characters were shallow and poorly developed, the audio is TERRIBLE, the cinematography is poor, and the editing is awful.I hope we are not to expect another film that is put together this poorly? Build on what you did RIGHT last time, not what you did wrong. This is uninspired, unpleasant, and unoriginal"
Igor             ,jemps918,0,animation,2008,9,"Really enjoyable! Igor and its cast of oddities are absolutely lovable! Igor is about the land of Malaria, which produces evil inventions and where the evil scientist is king. If you're born a hunchback, you are automatically an Igor, a generic evil scientist's assistant whose main job is to ""pull the switch!"" upon command. But one Igor (John Cusack) is different; he dreams of becoming a scientist as well, and has already made a few inventions of his own: his sidekicks Scamper (Steve Buscemi), the immortal Energizer bunny with a deathwish, and Brian (Will & Grace's Sean Hayes) the dyslexic brain who might be a bit too gay for his own good. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, Igor gets a chance to invent something really big that may just win him the praise his genius finally deserves.The plot is fairly original; the punch lines may be a bit trite sometimes but are still delivered well so they still work. The situations can be shockingly too dark for children but can be appreciated by adults who just want to have a good time. The animation is incredibly moody but quirky and unique, reminiscent of Tim Burton's creations though more tongue-in-cheek and not as depressing. No wonder Igor is so funny; its writer Chris McKenna also wrote for American Dad and its director Anthony Leondis was involved in the similarly humorous Emperor's New Groove 2 and Lilo & Stitch 2. It also helps to have a strong cast (that also includes talented comics John Cleese, Jennifer Coolidge and Molly Shannon) that fit their characters v. wel"
The Bank Job             ,simonparker1990,0,crime,2008,8,"I'll be honest, I only saw The Bank Job because I had some free tickets for an advance screening, had I have not got these tickets I would not have bothered seeing it. The only trailer I had saw for it just didn't really appeal to me, I do enjoy Jason Statham movies, but this one seemed a bit serious in my eyes. Still I went today to the 6.30 screening and was surprised to enjoy it quite as much as I did. Admittedly for the first half hour I did get quite bored, the characters weren't really memorable and the set up seemed really dull. Thankfully when the heist gets under way, and especially the aftermath, the movie hits top gear and left me thrilled. The fact the movie is based on a true story still leaves me quite amazed, as the events that happen seem purely like the stuff that you see in the movies. How much of it is real and how much of it is purely to make it a better movie, a fight involving Statham I am certain didn't happen. The performances are surprisingly well rounded, Statham doing a brilliant job and the majority of the supporting cast getting some great scenes. Alas the movie does start to fall apart under close inspection, the plot is never concluded quite as well as I would have liked, and the movie does have some long stretches where not a lot is happening. If you can overlook this fact then you will a lot to enjoy in this very well made movie.So onto the performances. As I have said Statham does a surprisingly admirable job in the film. When you look at his CV of films you realise he isn't exactly the most talented actor. In fact all he generally has to do is grumble and hit things a lot. But there is just no denying that the man has a hell of a lot of charisma, in this film he truly gets to display his acting skills. Of course on occasion he delivers a dodgy line, but then if you watch some of the smaller scenes with his characters wife you realise how much potential he has. If given the right material I am sure Statham can truly develop as an actor. Saffron Burrows is brilliant as the slightly suspicious Martine for the first half, unfortunately after the heist she has little to do and the character never felt fully concluded. Still she does have some great moments in the earlier part of the film. Daniel Mays runs off with the majority of the movie as Dave, in fact this looks set to launch Mays career a bit further, he has the best lines and is a funny character. Richard Lintern (who I have to confess I thought was Dougray Scott for half the film) is brilliant as the man behind the heist, in some way that is, and his character is one of the most rounded. Peter De Jersey as Michael X is menacing in his all too brief screen time, but like Martine his character never felt fully dealt with. Still he and the other chief villain, David Suchet, are quite menacing.The Bank Job when advertised does come across as a typical gangster flick with a lot of humour in it. However when watching it I have to be honest and say it isn't that funny. There are a couple of lines here and there but the movie doesn't really make you laugh that much. Neither is it that big of a gangster flick, of course there are the local gangster running around, and the movie becomes more along that line towards the end. But for the majority of the film it comes across as a slightly grittier and far less flashy Ocean's Eleven. The scenes where they try to rob the bank are definitely some of the highlights, however its the final 45 minutes that stick firmly in mind. What happens after the robbery is just thrilling to watch, will they get away with it, won't they? Things also get a lot darker near the end, also quite violent one scene, or the idea of what was going to happen, made me wince a bit. The film is superbly directed as well, its not too flashy but there are some great shots in there. Unfortunately the music does start to irritate after a while, everything seems overdone, a scene which is meant to be funny is ruined because the music sounds like its from an action movie, it just doesn't truly suit the film all the time. Also as previously mentioned the beginning as well is quite boring.Overall The Bank Job is a great movie that with a bit of fine tuning at the beginning could make it even better. If you want a smart thriller that will surprise you because of it being based on real events that I highly recommend this. Don't expect an all time classic though. 1"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,dumsumdumfai,0,animation,2011,8,"I think I get it. This animation has a very specific look and feel. It is definitely not Pixar or Disney.Even the story goes back to the days of knights, castles, princess in distress and the King as a sidekick.Now the plot gets a bit complicated, characters of all kinds shows up. And there's a big scene near the end. But this is somewhat gentle, a throwback.Still I can't get over the look. So distinct that it stayed in my mind. There's some softness which unlike most animation these days - are overly sharp for my tastes. And some characters' are drawn with slightly overdrawn features - except the mouses. While others are fairly normal in a sense.The story does shifts from perspective to perspective. Maybe some will get annoyed by this - and particularly not really done for extensive takes in animation. But I am OK. Maybe kids will get a bit confused by this"
WALL·E             ,claudio_carvalho,0,animation,2008,10,"In the Twentieth-Eighth Century, Earth is completely depleted and with the ecological system destroyed. The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter <U+0096> Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.""WALL-E"" is one of the best animations I have ever seen, with adorable characters and a deep story, showing a possible scenario of the depletion of our planet caused by the lack of concern from the big corporations with the environment. In addition, there is the beautiful love story of WALL-E, the importance of small and forgotten things; a great nostalgia of the old times among many other message. The story is very well developed in spite of having very few dialogs. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""WALL-E"""
Kung Fu Panda             ,piggypony,0,animation,2008,10,"When I watched the trailers to kung fu panda, I scoffed and sneered at the stupidity of a rude panda barging in and demanding to learn kung fu. If someone had asked me to go to that movie, I would have laughed in their faces, but gone anyway for the popcorn. As I watched the preview, I thought ""Well there's a waste of time and money, There's something I would never like."" ...Boy was I wrong. Kung fu panda has splashes of children and adult humor, done by the perfect Jack black, who fit so well with Po, the roly poly, cuddly panda. The scenery was breathtaking, and most of the time I forgot that the majestic shimmering water and lovely smooth trees were fake! The Thins that most surprised me was all the heart put into it. On the previews they are targeting mostly youths and younger audiences with their humor, but really the thing that I found sweetest of all was all the heart. The moral was so touching and sweet, that I could have never expected Dreamworks to pull it off, after their recent garbage like ""Over the Hedge"" ""Shark Tale"" and others.The scenery was beautiful, and the animation was outstanding! The characters fit so well with their voices, especially my all time favorite character Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman. True, Jackie Chan and the furious five didn't have too many lines, but this does not stop the upbeat trhill and flow of the movie. I am Definitely buying this movie the second it comes out on DVD, and have seen it 7 times in the theater. The battle scenes are superb, and my entire family is getting sick of me talking about them. The storyline is very original, and bright, but within all the humor there is a heart, and other emotions,such as sadness. One of my favorite scenes is the one in which the Brave Master Shifu battles with his former pupil, the vicious (and I mean vicious) Tai Lung.All the characters add their own little sparkle to the story, like sweetness being added to a cake. I really can't express my utter love for kung fu panda-It would be like trying to type out love, or music- it just can't be done. Sincerely, Piggypony"
A Christmas Tale             ,Quinoa1984,1,comedy,2008,7,"I got to hand it to the filmmaker, Arnaud Desplechin, at least on one significant point: A Christmas Tale is like a big book faithfully adapted to the screen, only in this case non-existent, and it has that wonderful if imperfect feeling of surrounding oneself with the world and atmosphere and attitudes of a family where the dysfunction runs deep and clear, emphasizing Tolstoy's classic ""no one unhappy family is the same"" credo. His film is also sometimes a big melodrama, folded around a cancer story not unlike a more serious (yet sometimes lighter version of) The Royal Tenenbaums, and centered so firmly around the family during that crazy but loving-despite-everything time of Christmas you'd swear Desplechin watched the first hour of Fanny & Alexander too many times to count.At the same time A Christmas Tale in very much a French film, is attitude and approach to narrative and occasionally nearing that dreaded P-word (pretentious) in being 2 1/2 hours of incidents and confrontations and little details and twists. A lot happens with the Vuillard family over a few days, but in it uncovers a whole can of worms involving a banished son (Mathieu Amalric, who thankfully is maybe the centerpiece of the ensemble in terms of being the black sheep like Anne Hathaway in Rachel Getting Married), a depressed daughter (Anne Consigny who, despite being effective in a one-note performance, is also so shrill and cold as a character it's hard to feel anything for her, at all, despite her plight of losing her older brother as a child), and a cousin who has loved his cousin's wife ever since he got him, Ivan, the youngest Vuillard brother, to hook up with her so many years ago. Meanwhile, the mother (Catherine Deneuve, who may not exactly be a great actress but is the greatest living female French star which carries a lot of weight as a true beauty), has cancer, possibly terminal, unless a donor comes forward.So there's a lot here to work with - maybe, perhaps, arguably too much, though it's almost a credit to the director that I can't say exactly what (little things, for example, like the Christmas Eve sex scene are deliberately paced but for good reason), and he laces everything with a curious jazz score throughout, sometimes to great effect and sometimes not. But, at the least, it's wonderful to see so many good actors in one place, particularly Amalric who is quickly becoming a truly fantastic talent with a lot of range in the work I've seen him in- one day he's a subdued intelligence man in Munich, next he's paralyzed except for one eye-blinking in Diving Bell, and even a 007 villain- and here goes further in a scene stealing performance (one such scene is his toast at the Christmas dinner, a scene actually shocking and hilarious and sad all in a thirty-second split).He and Deneuve and the underrated Jean-Paul Roussillon as the husband of Junon almost make me want to rate the movie higher. But alas, it is what it is: a very strong take on a familiar subject - crazy and light and dark and tragic and unnerving times with a family at Christmas - and standing it on its head, while also the things I mention above. Did I mention it's French? 7.5/10"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,larcenydogood,0,animation,2009,4,"Desperaux is a poorly conceived film, or, more to the point, three poorly conceived films rolled into one. Much too ambitious/confusing.First movie, a happy kingdom is about to celebrate their wondrous Soup Day. Among the happy throngs ready to eat are a sailor and his happy rat, Roscuro. Roscuro is so enthralled by the amazing soup that he sneaks into the castle for a closer glimpse and falls into the bowl from which none other than the queen herself is eating. This causes her to faint into her soup and suffer a quiet unnoticed death (No one thought the queen may need to breathe through all that soup?), so that her husband will become a near-catatonic depressive who spends his days in semi-darkness plucking away lachrymose tunes on a lute that sound like funeral music composed by Jethro Tull. He also bans rats and soup. Which drives away curiously, both the sun and rain.Next movie, Desperaux is born in an unused castle room-village of neurotic mice who seem as though they are all candidates for the Dr. Phil hall of fame. Desperaux is an adventurous mouse, which I suppose makes him a republican in a Hollywood allegorical, and this goes against the grain of angst that permeates his community and he therefore is eventually banished to the dungeons, where the rats, who have their colony in the darkness, will certainly eat him. Guess which rat outcast saves him.In the last of the three movies an angry dungeonkeepr yells at the comely wench who serves the princess. This servant girl, Miggery, has delusions of being the princess that manifest physically and is so anthropomorphic in reverse that any pigs watching the film would surely gasp, ""Golly, it's scary how swine-like they made her."" Then there's gladiatorial combat amongst the freaky looking rats, the princess is kidnapped and almost eaten by thousands of evil-looking rats, the mouse saves the kingdom and brings rain (see The Rainmaker, Dune, The Day After Tomorrow, et cetera). He also brings back the sun. And the soup. And we must assume, world peace and reduced carbon emissions.The whole thing is so convoluted, the characters, especially the dungeonkeeper and the maid, oh and the lugubrious king, and the rat who caused all the problems then tried to kill the princess then had a life-altering moment (apparently he got access to some of the mice's Dr. Phil literature) are hard to care for, there is no emotional charge other than ""Jeez, those are nasty rats"", which are much too scary for little children, there's a ridiculous Quixotic-kamikaze man whose body is entirely vegetative (I suppose it would be difficult to have a Quixotic-kamikaze man whose body is entirely vegetative not be ridiculous), there is no humor other than laughing at Desperaux's ears (one is left pining for the ""wit"" of Shrek's bodily evacuations) and it is way too violent to be a kids' movie which it was marketed as. The whole movie comes across like the king, cleverly drawn but emotionally barren."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,olddiscs,1,misc,2008,9,"I was truly impressed today by the film, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" for me its getting the new film year off to a very good start!! Weve known about Ann Boleyn and her beheading but this film gives new insight into reasons why ,and the amazing relationship between Ann and her sister Mary.. The plot line never gets dull and moves at a great pace..(usually historical films can be stodgy and boring) This one never lets up..The performances are wonderful , especially,Natalie Portman as Ann and Scarlett Johnansen as Mary... the entire supporting cast is outstanding..The sets and costumes are very authentic.,and the cinematography is beautiful Im not sure how historically accurate this film is ,but as a movie its well worth seeing Don't miss ""The Other Boleyn Girl"""
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,davidgrant-2,0,drama,2008,1,"I can't believe how positive the reviews for this movie are. I was extremely disappointed in this movie.1. The old woman's voice was extremely annoying and over-acted. Perhaps even unrealistic as I have never heard an old person talk like that.2. The hummingbird showing up at sea was stupid. Then it showed up again in the hurricane at the very end of the movie which was completely ridiculous.3. When Benjamin was born he was born with the mind of a child, the body of an 80-year old but he was baby-sized. The fact that he had the body of a child but was baby-sized was a bit bit inconsistent but fine, I'll accept it. When he aged, his body size grew, but everything other than his body size became younger, and his brain grew older. Then, by the end of the movie, he had the mind of an 80-year old, and the body of a baby, but he was baby-sized again. He should have started as a normal sized 80-year old or he should have died as a large baby. I prefer the former. He could have been born as a 100 lb old man, and that could have explained why the mother died, because she had given birth to a 100 lb old man (she could have been a 300 lb pregnant woman, not any harder to believe than Benjamin's condition itself). Yeah it sounds crazy, but to me it makes more sense and is more consistent.4. When old-body, young-mind Benjamin was screwing the whore they made reference to his stamina and he said something like ""let's go again"" to the whore. If he had an old body he would not have been such a performer in bed. Are people so stupid to believe that performance in bed is only mental?5. Incredibly boring. Moves at a very slow pace for the entire movie. There is almost no conflict, just boring scene after boring scene.6. Mr. Button grabbed the baby from the room in front of some nurses and a doctor and then ran away from a cop. He got away from the cop and put the baby on someone's front stairs. Did none of the people who saw him take the baby report him? At least to the media? If this movie made any effort to be realistic at all, Mr. Button would have feigned joy at the baby's birth and then dumped the baby after everyone had left. Or, they would have reported a missing baby with wrinkly skin.7. Last minute of the movie was such a groaner. ""Some play music, some are mothers, some dance..."" give me a break.8. Too long for what it is. 1"
Sex and the City             ,bob the moo,1,comedy,2008,NA,"Since any opinion on this movie has to be tempered by sex and viewing history let me just make it clear up front that I am a man and, while I don't dislike the series, I didn't ever get into it beyond watching (and enjoying) the odd episode that someone else was watching in the same room as I was sitting. Please feel free to dismiss/accept my opinions accordingly in light of this information. My first proper reaction to the Sex & the City movie was to baulk at the running time, which struck me as pretty excessive for what it was. I was right on this as the film is longer than it probably deserves to be but at the same time it never dragged as badly as I expected. The characters are older now and, after the series ended, all partnered up to a certain degree and ""happy"" in their relationships. Carrie and Big have settled into a new flat and this has made Carrie think about commitment and legal connections <U+0096> a path that leads to them deciding to get married. While Big gets nervous, Carrie goes planning crazy, Miranda sows the seeds of problems in her own marriage, Charlotte plays happy families and Samantha has it all except one thing.This plot setup creates the focus of the film <U+0096> less on the free-wheeling sex and modern relationships of the series and more on the pitfalls of a mature relationship. This offered more substance to carry the film from my point of view but unfortunately this was not to be the case here. For too much of the film the material is superficial and sentimental with ""love"" not ever being all that real and instead smacking of easy steps in the writing that focused on events rather than the characters. Fans may say that the show was never about great depths and, in my limited experience, I agree <U+0096> it was witty, light and bubbly. The problem is that, the occasional moment aside, the film just isn't that way <U+0096> understandably perhaps given the narrative demands of the platform and the running time. Problem is, without the witty swiftness of the series, something else is required and this is why the substance was important <U+0096> and why the film is damaged by the lack of depth on this occasion.This doesn't make a bad film but it does severely limit it to being ""average"" in the main content. What doesn't help at this time of recession (and the film was released during this period) is just how endlessly capitalist the whole thing. The audience needs to care for these characters and that is a little difficult when money is no object for them, retail therapy solves everything and so much dialogue is about expensive items. To top all that, given how easy it is to get product placement into a film about shopping why on earth did we have to have such clumsy and obvious product placement (the iPhone being the worst example). The cast do their usual shtick and all look good and play comfortably with their characters. Some reviews have criticised the four actresses but the material is to blame rather than them. The male cast are mainly just narrative devices and, with the exception of Eigenberg and possibly Noth.The Sex and the City film is an average film with lots of problems. Generally this opinion is dismissed if it comes from a male non-fan but I cannot imagine that fans of the series are totally happy with this either. It doesn't manage to capture the spirit of the series but nor does it manage to replace it with anything else of note in regards depth or substance. It is glossy and professional enough to distract but if the plan was to continue the series through the occasional film then this is a pretty poor way to start off."
WALL·E             ,comixdude3,0,animation,2008,10,"I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, I'm convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, and perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies period. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel with Wall-E, pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that's more intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than any movie in years.The film start's off on a simultaneously sweet and sour note: The opening reveals the gorgeous backdrop of galaxies and stars, with music from the movie 'Hello-Dolly!' overlapping it all in a sugary visual treat. Not seconds later, the camera traverses space to slowly close in on the planet Earth which, 700 years in to the future, has gained a sickly green tint to it along with an orbital atmosphere of pure garbage. Further zooming reveals a desolated city (New York, maybe?) its buildings and bridges rotted way. The entire opening is very reminiscent of the recent I Am Legend, except much, much more ruined. It is however, technically beautiful; the images are so photo realistic that you're amazed that they've been generated by computer. The only remnants of humanity are monstrous skyscrapers of compacted trash and billboards aplenty advertising the bright and colorful, yet somehow ominous company known as Buy n' Large, a thinly veiled Wal-Mart clone. And, of course, Wall-E itself.Wall-E is far more than a mere 'it', however. Through hundreds of nuanced and heartfelt animation quirks, as well as the ""voice"" given by Ben Burtt, Star-Wars veteran and creator of another famed beeping robot named R2-D2, Wall-E has been imbued with enough life to fill three-dozen cheap summer kids flicks, all without ever saying more than two or three actual words.Wall-E has been operating for centuries, long after his other Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class counterparts have shut down or broken apart, scouring the wastelands of earth and compacting the land's garbage in to neat little cubes.It's a lonely job, with the little robot's only companion being a spunky little cockroach. Wall-E has over the years collected an impressive amount of junk with which he passes the time, including lighters, toys, spare parts, and an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly!, which is Wall-E's instructor in the ways of life, love, and keenly choreographed dance. Indeed, Wall-E gazes upon two lovers holding hands and the look in his binocular eyes is both heartbreaking and beautiful. It all changes however, when a beautiful robot from the human colony in space arrives; her name is EVE. Despite here tendencies to blow up anything that moves, Wall-E is smitten at first sight, and EVE comes to eventually share those feelings. After taking note of a very unique possession of Wall-E's however, EVE reports back to the Earth ship Axiom and is whisked away back in to space. Wall-E, being as devoted as he is, follows her into the unknown, and it is there that the movie really gets going, with Wall-E and EVE taking part in an adventure with the fate of humanity itself in the balance. Characters like the Captain of the Axiom (voiced by Jeff Garlin) appearing to flesh out the film's plot, as well as a gaggle of amusing ""rogue"" robots that aide Wall-E and EVE in their quest. As the movie develops, however, the leading characters' romance becomes the core of the movie, with Wall-E and EVE's love being one of the few genuinely lovely and convincing romances of recent cinema. The touching moments Wall-E shares with EVE in his workshop, as well as their first ""kiss"" preceding a marvelous dance through space highlight a relationship that tugs at the heartstrings and moistens the eyes far more than movies like Fool's Gold or What Happens in Vegas. The romance between the two leads is the very soul of the movie, and could not have been better executed. The film is gorgeous to boot: With colors and images that dazzle and linger long after the film is over. Films like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, as beautiful as they are, seem to revel in the gloom of browns and blacks. Wall-E, on the other is vibrant and alive, turning even the beginning's post-apocalyptic wasteland in to a marvel. The biggest surprise of Wall-E, however, would be its surprising amount of maturity. Wall-E deals with themes of pollution, rampant consumerism, societal complacency and obesity, media desensitization, and other themes that would frankly fly over a child's head. Kids will see a world full of people who are humorously fat and happy; older members of the audience, however, will see a society that tells of a future not centuries ahead of us but perhaps only decades. The overblown laziness and rampant consumerism is evident already today, and the notion of Wall-E's future being so similar is funny yes, but also a touch unnerving.It is for this reason that I hold Wall-E in such high esteem: It is a heartfelt work of inarguable art that not only entertains but holds enough conscience and commentary to get even the most casual of moviegoer thinking about the future. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking. It is funny and it is also a tad scary. It has two supposedly life-less robots teaching humanity the very meaning of being human, as well as learning the meaning of true love themselves. It made me laugh, it made me (almost) cry. It has the distinction of being Pixar's best movie, as wells as the hands down best movie of the year (so far); an almost perfect, if not completely perfect summer movie that kids and adults will almost assuredly love.And it is also one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,julia-635-195152,1,comedy,2010,1,"This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. The lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii, looks good on bluray. Cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes which fall flat. Many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. May all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap."
Sex and the City             ,Benedict_Cumberbatch,1,comedy,2008,NA,"...or at least try to be original? Saying that ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" is just for the fans is unnecessary (like it was made for another audience, right?). Who else except die hard fans of the show will be crazy for this movie?Is it predictable? Yes. Is it just a longer episode of the TV show? Yes. Is it funny? Depends. If you like the show, you'll laugh; if you don't, you won't. Simple as that. It doesn't try or pretend to be art-house material or an Oscar contender (except for the costume design, of course), but it's definitely good entertainment and a pleasant couple of hours with buttery popcorn and a Red Bull. 7/10. 3"
W.             ,seamo42,0,misc,2009,4,"'W.', Oliver Stone's latest true story film, is a simple biopic of America's 43rd President George W. Bush, touching on certain aspects of his life, including his college life, his alcoholism and his relationship with his father, the 41st president George Bush, while revolving mainly around his first term in the white house, specifically his controversial 'war on terror' and search for WMDs in Iraq. Like any biopic, there are two ways for it to be viewed. The first is how the feature stands as a film on its own, regardless of its comparison to the source material. Obviously the other way of perceiving it is to compare it to the source material, considering it's about something real and about real people who are alive or have lived. Unfortunately 'W.' is a movie that isn't particularly strong with either of these angles in mind.The film's light and sweet perspective, which portrays George W. Bush as a smart and well meaning guy, with flaws like the rest of us, doesn't balance with the fact that many of the scenes drone on. This is significant especially for audience members with no particular political expertise, which arguably this film should appeal to. Its father and son story has no real interesting conflict either, except for early on which isn't a good place to have focus, since we're meant to be kept sitting around for the duration of the 2 hours, of which this film runs. The structure of the film is confusing and the ending itself falls flat, leaving a hole that the audience may not be able to fill themselves, seemingly trying to make tough point about whatever issues the film is attempting to cover.In terms of comparing the film to the real subjects of which it is based on, 'W.' has even less to show for itself as the film focuses on the less interesting, or more widely known, pieces of just Bush's first term, and almost completely avoids the interesting material. Examples of said material would be the controversial speculation around the legitimacy of his position as president, the even more questionable aspects of Bush's behaviour around the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the film even makes absolutely no mention of Hurricane Katrina.The performances in this film are the only real things it has to brag about as Josh Brolin carries the film quite nicely with his charming and quirky take on Bush, along with Richard Dreyfuss' Dick Cheney, Thandie Newton's Condoleezza Rice, and others. However these still feel like impressions, granted they are rather good impressions. Another problem with the film's performances is James Cromwell's portrayal of George Bush Sr., as he is shown as a sweet, hard working old man, with no similarities shown in the real George Bush Sr.'s speech or mannerisms, which, I guess, was necessary to make the character likable.Overall, 'W.' is reasonably entertaining with its imitations of the American president and the people surrounding him in his career, however the viewers shouldn't delude themselves into thinking it as a reliable source of historical or political information as it covers any subject it has chosen to include, very lightly giving very little for it to say, despite the fact that there would be many things for this film to include, considering its protagonist's history. The only real conceivable, politically taut, reason for why this film was even released before the end of Bush's time as president is that, to avoid anyone else making a biopic of Bush, in case they might have had the kind of daft, one sided sense to portray George W. Bush as a hero, and his enemies as scum, Oliver Stone jumped at making the film in an act that sort of resembles suppressing an explosion.Verdict: Stone's telling of George W. Bush's life is long but thin, however it doesn't have any huge bias leaving it as an empty and boring chronicle with little harm."
Wendy and Lucy             ,ameliah,1,drama,2009,1,"I was greatly looking forward to this film, because I love Michelle Williams' acting and because it had received some ecstatic reviews. What a disappointment! The absence of any back-story or motivation for her character, plus the inexplicable and contradictory choices she makes, result in a film experience that winds up being infuriating. I left the theater fuming.Some questions I wish I could ask Kelly Reichardt and Jonathan Raymond:1) If Wendy is careful enough to keep a running tally of her expenses, and she has over $500 before the car repair that she thinks will cost around $300, why does she risk shoplifting a couple of cans of dog food? 2) Why doesn't she complain immediately that something needs to be done with her dog while she's in police custody? The way her mention of Lucy comes as an after-thought, as if she's forgotten her until the moment she sees her out the back window of the police car, is just not credible. No dog owner, especially one who depends on her pet as her only source of emotional support, would behave that way!3) Wendy's anomie and lack of affect needed some kind of explanation to make her bearable to watch. If we hadn't seen her keeping track of her expenses, a logical conclusion would have been that she was mentally impaired, which I don't think was intended. If she was supposed to be some kind of slacker Everywoman, she needed either more street smarts or a reason why she lacked them.4) If my tally is correct, Wendy had just under $500 at the end of the film, since the car mechanic had agreed to settle her bill for just $30. So why is her only option to hop a freight car? Nothing we've been shown about Wendy argues that she has the skills to survive such a rough and dangerous course of action. Why doesn't she get a job flipping burgers in the town she's in? Or try to find a ride to Alaska? 5) Although her final scene with Lucy made me tear up, I was also angered by it. She bases her decision to leave Lucy on the fact that the yard is ""nice"" and that the elderly man she sees leaving the house also looks nice. If you were going to leave your beloved dog behind, wouldn't you want to know a little more about the person taking care of her? And wouldn't you want to get his phone number so you could check up on her and, with luck, come back for her?? Again, her behavior is absolutely not credible. All in all, an unforgivably sloppy piece of work and a huge waste of Michelle Williams' talent and the audience's time."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,kneiss1,1,misc,2010,9,"I am German, but usually I dislike German movies. So it was a big surprise for me how great this movie actually was. (After all the disappointing Hollywood movies, I will definitely look out for some more German movies.)Life sometimes writes the best stories, but that doesn't mean that they are always told well. In this case the movie told the story perfectly. Of course not everything happened exactly as it was told, but the whole movie was very convincing. Psychologically the whole thing was very smart, the talks have been totally impressive and intellectual.Even the action was great. Probably the best action ever shown in a German movie. Actors also have been on a very high level.I personally would have liked a bit more information. But yea, the movie is already 2,5 hours long. I understand that they needed to leave out a lot of stuff. The movie did an amazing job of generating a great mix of entertainment, information and realism. - Something very unusual"
Surveillance             ,merylmatt,1,crime,2009,1,"After the first few minutes of this movie, I was leaning on the fast-forward button. After a few minutes more, I realized I'd already ""watched"" this movie before - also on fast forward. Neither time did anything catch my attention.************* Possible Spoilers ********** The movie opens with instant gore, mayhem and murder a la fashion of a slasher flick. Of course, it is dark, so you cannot see what is happening.Clichéd at best, two bored small town cops are petty dictators in their rural, boring patrol beat, so they terrorize innocent people and threaten them with their guns. Oh, and they're drinking on the job. Of course, their is tension and friction when the FBI get involved.The FBI agents are ""go get my coffee and unload my car"" mentality to the local yokel's.The young innocent girl survivor who has to tell her stories by drawing crayon pictures of what happened. And the story gets dragged to its sad conclusion.I do not recommend this movie for anyone at any price (I got it from the library, so at least i did not loose money) unless you have tired of watching paint dry."
Nights in Rodanthe             ,screenwriter-14,1,drama,2008,8,"NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care. James Franco in another micro role is just the right casting, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house, is a true Fall 2008 film to remember forever, as was THE NOTEBOOK."
Julia             ,fezzykins,1,crime,2009,8,"To some this film would be boring, long and drawn out. But to people who love film for what it should be for example plot, filming and acting this was a great film. The people who don't like it are Hollywood blockbuster, special effects junkies who wouldn't know a good film if they were in it..... what a shame!Tilda goes through the whole spectrum of emotions in this film quick changing from one emotion to the next. When a person takes on such a role as this, they have to enjoy what they do otherwise they would go insane. Oh and her American accent is flawless unlike other nameless actors. If you get the chance watch this film with an open mind and plenty of patience as it is a long film with many of the scenes nay almost all the scenes contain Tilda's magnificent performance"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,soundwave010,0,animation,2008,9,"Having realised that this would be the only Star Wars film I hadn't seen on the big screen, I casually decided to get some showing times from my regular cinema only to discover that it had been pulled due to lack of interest; I eventually managed to find a showing - the last showing in the West Midlands - and, having not been exposed to the critical lambasting this film received, went in as a Tabula Rasa, not really expecting anything one way or the other.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this film is, in fact, excellent: far pacier, punchier and edgier than the entire prequel trilogy combined, it surprised me further by being solidly scripted, with moments of true brilliance - the relationship between Anakin and accidental Padawan Ahsoka is refreshingly written (a woman in Star Wars who isn't a two-dimensionally written walking stereotype 'damsel in distress' with appalling dialogue; I haven't seen that since 1987!)and reminiscent of the 'buddy comedy' elements of the original (Episodes IV-VI) trilogy that existed between Luke, Han, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian; the action sequences (which constitute the majority of the film) are breathtaking, breakneck and frequently pay their dues to classic war films. The opening Clone Trooper assault pays homage to Saving Private Ryan's introductory onslaught, while a later gunship assault tributes Predator by way of Full Metal Jacket (""Welcome to paradise, rock-jumpers!!""). The film is permeated by many sequences and references that will go whistling over the heads of its supposedly younger audience; it also has something that has also been missing from Star Wars for some time: a genuine sense of humour - witness the repartee between the Battle Droids throughout the film as a solid example of this.The animation isn't as bad as many have claimed: it's stripped back, beautifully stylised and won't date as badly as the likes of Beowulf by virtue of that fact; unfortunately, this film has been pulled from most theatres, so it's too late to come out in solidarity at the eleventh hour, but the DVD is due for release on the 8th of December. Finally, although this film only took around $100 million dollars worldwide, it cost a paltry $8.5 million to make. Once more, Lucas is laughing all the way to the bank."
Flash of Genius             ,ajs-10,0,misc,2010,7,"I really enjoy a courtroom drama and I really enjoy watching the little guy get the better of the big corporation. So I was really pleased when I came across this film, which combines the two. Set in Detroit in the 1960's, it tells of one man's battle to get recognition from a large automobile manufacturer who, he claims, stole his idea.Bob Kearns is a college professor who teaches engineering, he's also an inventor. He is married to Phyllis and they have six children (yes, six). One day while driving his family home from church in a rainstorm, he comes up with an idea for an intermittent windscreen wiper. He designs a prototype and, with the help of his long-time friend, Gil Previck, he gets it patented. Now Bob wants to sell his idea to Ford, the largest automobile manufacturer, but he also wants to manufacture it himself. They show the idea to Ford, being very careful not to show them how it works, and they are impressed. After a meeting with one of their top managers, Macklin Tyler, and with promises of contracts, Bob eventually lets them examine his prototype. Just as he's getting ready to go into manufacturing, Ford pulls the plug and Bob is left feeling let down. This is until the day he sees a new Ford Mustang in the street with an intermittent wiper on it. He is determined to get Ford to admit they stole his idea, so much so that it affects both his marriage and mental state. I'll leave my little summary there or I'll give too much away!A really well made film that captured the world of 1960's Detroit very well. Great performances from both Greg Kinnear as Bob Kearns and Lauren Graham as his long suffering wife Phyllis. Honourable mentions go to Dermot Mulroney as Gil Previck, Mitch Pileggi as Macklin Tyler and it was nice to see Alan Alda as the lawyer Gregory Lawson.The first half of the film is quite slow, there's a lot of character development and I felt it ambled along a little too much. However, the second half is much better, the story really starts to take off and there is a really good ending. I really engaged with the main characters and I found it a very enjoyable film to watch. It's slightly over long, but it's one I can certainly recommend.My score: 6.8/"
Street Kings             ,stensson,,misc,2008,3,"It's LA police corruption for the 1.000.000th time. Even I found out within half an hour who was the biggest crook. And it only took about five minutes to figure out who was gonna die and who was gonna survive.As expected in mainstream movies of this kind nowadays, it's much of boring blood and much of boring ultra violence, together with some rotten corpses. The movie pretends to tell deep things about power, but that excuse for showing all this amount of unrealistic killing is a bad one.Certainly Keanu Reeves has got a lot of money for doing this, but that anyway ought to be a poor compensation for him.

Quarantine             ,terrencepatrix,1,horror,2008,1,"Seriously I'm sick of this genre of movies. Shaky videos found in the aftermath of a horrible situation...enough already. This probably won't be the best review you read for this movie, but for an avid horror movie enthusiast watching with eyes wide open...this movie was just...bad.Simple plot summary. A reality show that features late night careers is showcasing a fire station. They eventually get a call to a complex with an undisclosed issue. When they enter they encounter a strange old women standing there with blood and spit hanging from her mouth and she's growling. Now for the plot...get together a group of people with absolutely no survival or social skills who all happen to be mentally handicapped. Next lock them all into a complex with each other. Mix in a very unintimidating zombie wannabe virus and let them all run around with their arms flailing about. That's this movie.I'm sorry, but this movie was just...stupid and ridiculous. The story is actually really good (I hear it is based of some other movie that I've never watched, but whatever) and could have been executed soooo much better. The acting wasn't really bad, just completely without direction. The gore was there, but the camera was so damn shaky you could never focus on any of the action. The way the people reacted and the ending was just so pathetic it's unbelievable.-SPOILER- Really, if I'm trapped in a complex with some weird virus that turns people into violent monsters...I would not gather together in a lobby. I would gather the uninfected and secure myself behind one of the very thick well locked doors that the complex offers and wait it out. I would definitely not: Try and gather the infected into my arms, put my head near the infected persons face, lock myself in a room with the infected, run after the infected when they go crazy, eat someone, and take off. These people basically offer themselves up on a platter in this movie and it's just pathetic to watch. The end of the movie is so sudden that the audience actually groaned and stomped out of the theater.DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE, it is an OK rent or download but to pay $10 to see it is ridiculous. This movie is more of a 2 but I'm voting a 1 to help offset the idiots who vote this a 8+."
The Duchess             ,harry_tk_yung,1,misc,2008,NA,"""Melodrama"" and ""period piece"" say just about everything when it comes to ""the Duchess"". Several opening establishing sequences quickly set the scene <U+0096> young, playful Georgiana (Keira Knightley) rejoicing at her mother Lady Spencer's (Charlotte Rampling) announcing her good fortune of soon to become the Duchess of Devonshire. The opportunity is not lost to also introduce in these early scenes her future lover Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). Her dream of a love-marriage (she has, after all, already met the Duke twice), however, is soon shattered as the Duke of Devonshire claims her virginity on their wedding night as if he is undertaking a military exercise. It soon becomes evident that to him, her only reason of existence is to produce a male heir. This all sound very familiar and ""The other Boleyn girl"" comes immediately to mind, a movie that, by comparison, offers more zest and vigour.With the all-too-familiar plot line of a failed marriage (mentioned all too often by the protagonists) and the single-agenda of whether she can ultimately produce a boy, the story quickly loses momentum. To rescue comes an interesting character Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), a sympathy-earning women prevented from seeing her three sons by her brutal husband. Befriended by Georgiana and taken into their household, she goes on to become the Duke's mistress. Georgiana, in her made-belief poetic justice, starts an affair with Grey. There are other details but essentially this is the story that provides the base for not a few emotional outbursts and melodramatic conflicts.Acting obviously carried a lot in such a movie and here, comparison with another recent period piece is interesting and illuminating: ""Brideshead revisited"". The more straight comparison is Charlotte Rampling with Emma Thompson. Those who have seen Thompson in ""Brideshead"" will remember her impeccable, powerful portrayal of Lady Marchmain. Rampling in ""Duchess"" is stereotyped that does not full deserve her talents.A much more interesting situation is Hayley Atwell who appears in both movies and is arguably the best among the three leads in ""Brideshead"", playing Julia Flyte. Very interestingly, there are two lines of comparison. First, as respective female leads, Atwell in ""Brideshead"" plays a complex role with depth and reserve that Knightley hadn't been able to command in ""Duchess"". The other comparison, of the both of them in ""Duchess"", is even more fascinating. Even when Bess Foster is a supporting role, it is a more complex character and offers some of the few non-cliché elements in the movie <U+0096> her prime motivation for betraying her best friend is her absolutely unwavering determination to see her kids (something only the powerful Duke can help her with). Atwell handles the job beautifully, outshining Knightley. This is not to say that Knightley is not good; but Atwell is definitely better.Ralph Fiennes is delightful (if not elating) to watch as he manages to create a character that is even more fiendish than Voldemort! Dominic Cooper, whom you might have seen recently as the young boyfriend in ""Mama Mia!"", gives a credible if not spectacular performance as Grey.As a period piece, this movie fulfills the audiences' expectation of plush mise-en-scene, lush landscape and pulse-stopping costumes. Those interested in camera work will notice the repeated use of contrasting out-focused surroundings with the sharply focused object (such as when Lady Spencer points out her daughter to the Duke at the opening scenes). One interesting thing I must mention is how the names of the Duchess's three little girls pop up in front of them in a carriage scene. I can't help but wonder aloud if this is taking a cue from Facebook's photo tagging <U+0096> signs of our tim"
I Sell the Dead             ,poe426,,misc,2010,4,"Surprisingly uninteresting movie considering the subject matter; bland and uninvolving, with lackluster performances. Only during the initial ""resurrection"" (when it turns out that the resurrection men have resurrected a vampire) does anything even remotely interesting happen: the corpse is shown twitching spastically as it returns to life- just before it attacks. The attack itself, however, doesn't amount to much (it's brief, and not very well staged). The only other chance the filmmakers have to ""grab"" their audience occurs when the two blackguards unearth what turns out to be the corpse of- wait for it- an extraterrestrial. What might've been a classic scene, however, is handled ineptly: when the Mothership (one assumes; it's never actually shown) ""spirits"" the corpse away, the graverobbers just shrug it off and retire to the local pub for the night.

It was slow paced but I give it credit that it wasn't your ordinary Hollywood movie that would've had the characters jumping into bed, or massive explosions to buildings and cars.The ending was the worst. Having Michael Keaton's character just walk off into the sunset left too many questions unanswered, which I hate in a movie that takes the cheap way out. What happened with Kate? Did she and Detective Murcheson finally sit down for a complete dinner? Did Detective Murcheson gather enough evidence to have a warrant issued for Frank Logan? Guess I'm glad we only spend 99 cents on this, purchasing the movie from a Blockbuster going out of business sal"
Frozen River             ,Chrysanthepop,1,crime,2009,NA,"'Frozen River' gives us a glimpse of the life of poor working class Americans, something that is rarely seen in films nowadays. While it is known that the poor are homeless or they become criminals such as being part of a gang, robbery etc. Very little is seen about the working class who are almost penniless but just manage to get by with their daily struggle and a thankless job.'Frozen River' tells the story of two such single mothers. One is a Mohawk widow who earns her bucks by smuggling people into the states through the frozen river. She hopes to provide enough to raise her son who is in the custody of her mother-in-law. The other is a white mother of two whose husband just took off with all the money she saved for a house and is left in despair as she has to pay off debts. An unexpected encounter with her Mohawk counterpart allows her a possibility.First timer Courtney Hunt does a fabulous job as writer and director. She's clearly put a lot of heart into making the film. She has chosen a very minimal approach (e.g. minimal dialogues, raw scenery, restrained performances from actors etc) but the saying 'less is more' really can easily be applied this case. The dialogues are of a few words but they speak volumes. The snowy landscape is beautiful but at the same time scary (who would dare drive over a frozen river?).Melissa Leo finally gets a role that explores her acting capability to the fullest. She's always been a talent that was waiting to be exposed and 'Frozen River' does just that. The actress isn't afraid to look her worst in front of the camera all for the benefit of the role and quietly breathes fire into her character. Misty Upham is another underused actress who shines as Lila. She manages to hold her own with Leo. Her lack of experience as an actress in contrast to Leo's filmography may be what has worked for her as a single mother who is rather young and new to motherhood while Ray is someone with two kids (one of whom is a 15 year old).In 'Frozen River' the broken American dream is broken but one has to survive. We see the immigrants moving in harsh conditions to be a part of this dream and we see Lila and Ray pick up the broken pieces of that dream and find a way to survive only to provide their kids a better future. 'Frozen River' is a ge"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,ttherman-2,1,comedy,2009,1,"I don't get it. I'm SO tired of people telling me these ""Apatow"" movies are funny, then I rent them and they are TOTALLY lame. All of them. This is a prime example. This one is LITERALLY, ""The Emperors New Clothes."" Someone has no clothes= laugh riot. And I have nothing against raunchy humor, but this is just not funny. I appreciate that they tried to have characters, but where are the jokes? It plays like a meandering weak sitcom with occasional nude people and unfunny cursing substituting for laughs. And two hours long????? You've got to be kidding me. Brevity is often best with comedy, but not in the Apatow cannon. ""Knocked-Up,"" another disappointing snooze (that some critic compared""Annie Hall""-- Huh ????) is two hours and fifteen minutes!!!!!! I long for the days when Woody Allen's average length for a comedy was 86 minutes. Stop telling me this junk is funny! You want a funny, raunchy comedy? Rent, ""Animal House."""
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,sanjr1,0,animation,2008,2,"""Fly Me To The Moon"" has to be the worst animated film I've seen in a LONG TIME. That's saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous...trite. The voice acting is atrocious, Too cute sounding. The humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television.It gets a 2 only because of it's OK 3-D visuals. Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but We've seen much better in the past. I also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes. While that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators.I will say this though, It had a pretty cool soundtrack. And for the record my son wasn't too crazy about it either. Bad movie."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,Paynemanor,0,animation,2008,7,"Yes, the opening intro without JW's music or the crawl was a HUGE mistake. (The voice over did make me cringe..ugh!) Yes, the human characters looked freakin bizarre (Kenobi's beard looked like a wood carving) and they should have gone with a more realistic look instead of the pointless style they used.And yes, the story was pretty childish for a feature film aimed at adults...But that's the thing. This is an opener for a TV cartoon. It was not intended to blend right into the live action franchise. My kids liked it just fine, and I was not offended at all by it. In fact the action scenes were quite impressive. We finally get to see enough clone/droid mayhem to make people complain that it's too much (meaning almost enough clone/droid mayhem for me:) You guys are like a bunch of spoiled kids. Luke, Han, & Co. are NEVER coming back! Some day someone will probably do a series of re-makes or spin-offs that will have a more serious tone, and I agree that the franchise really needs that. But it won't happen while George is at the wheel. So if your going to get suicidal every time George cranks out one of his Disney-phase projects...Just stay away from it. It's not worth the stress."
Pride and Glory             ,davideo-2,,crime,2008,7,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning When four police officers are brutally gunned down in a run down, drug infested tower block, it sets a deadly chain of events in motion that threaten to tear apart the brotherly structure of the New York Police Department. Honest cop Ray Tierney (Edward Norton) starts with the proper approach, getting a statement from an eye witness to what may have gone on in the shape of an innocent, unlying child who admits to having seen notorious drug dealer Angel Tezo (Ramon Rodriguez) fleeing from the scene in fear. With what happened starting to look fairly obvious, the hunt begins for Tezo. Unfortunately, that includes less honest cops Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell), related to Ray through marriage, and his men whose corrupt activities have lead to the murders. It all builds up to a devastating battle between family and friends, loyalty and justice, truth and honour.As any one who's glanced at the trivia section (or Empire Magazine!) will already know, work on Pride and Glory was scheduled to begin as far back as 2001, but owing to America's characteristically patriotic respect for NY cops who risked their lives to save lives that fateful day, any suggestion of corruption amongst them was deemed, well, unpatriotic and it's been left till seven years later for the film to come out. It would appear the most high profile film to come from writer/director Gavin O' Connor, whose other credits appear a smattering of unheard of films that have skipped the sort of exposure this one's got.Though a few have claimed the film has been done before (which it surely has), it is still far more than a standard, straight-forward cop thriller, with an intelligent, twisty turny screenplay that keeps you hooked with it's developments and raw honesty. Despite this, the narrative flow fails to keep going as well as you'd like, and a fair few scenes gracelessly flow on from the last one rather than keeping you hooked for them. Also on the plus side are strong, solid performances from leading men Norton and Farrell, not to mention Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich as the other honest, well meaning father/son cop team caught up in the middle of the corrupt shenanigans as everyone else. But Norton and Farrell not only have good presence, they have good chemistry together and it's a shame they're scenes together are too few. Another down point is their climactic fisticuffs session, which feels corny and out of place amongst what has been a raw, unflinching, brutally and unsearingly honest cop film up till now, belonging more at the end of a Jet Li or Chuck Norris movie to be honest.Still, this is a solid, well made cop thriller that was still quite worth the wait. ***"
Mamma Mia!             ,hawkbadger56,1,comedy,2008,1,"I don't know where most of you were at, but where I watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79, so I did appreciate them then and I still do now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter. "
Surveillance             ,krecaido,1,crime,2009,2,"After reading numerous positive reviews I decided to give this ""thriller"" a go. Several reviews warned that the first 20 minutes or so could be interpreted as comical and indeed they were. When the plot finally got kicking, I was intrigued for a good five minutes, but was mislead into caring about the characters by the surprisingly, wonderful cinematography. While that may seem like a good thing for the movie, it wasn't. As the movie plays out and you find yourself not caring in the slightest when characters are killed off, you realize you have zero connection with any of the characters. With the exception of the older and younger blond (that's how forgettable the characters are, I don't even know their names or remember if they even had names) the acting is on par with a 5th grade production. All the characters are extremely exaggerated, to the point of detachment from anyone you can relate to. The twist was unpredictable, yet unsatisfying as there is no explanation or reason for their tirade. The final scene is ridiculously stupid. It's as if the writers couldn't take a risk in dealing with a certain character so instead they just leave you stranded.This movie is NOT recommended."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,Chrysanthepop,0,misc,2008,NA,"'Step Up 2: The Streets' follows a typical storyline of an 'underdog' striving to make it and in the end overcomes all obstacles and succeeds. The dialogues are passable, mostly the typical lines. But, what makes it so entertaining is the incredible dance sequences, amazingly choreographed and superbly performed by the actors/dancers. The film is full of energy and excitement. Break dancing (well, dancing in general) is something that has always intrigued me so the film kept me engaged throughout. The acting is adequate. Briana Evigan is a talented dancer and not a bad actress either. Her other cast members dance well too. The soundtrack boosts of adrenaline guiding and giving voice to the dance moves. In spite of the done to death storyline, I enjoyed this one. Anyone interested in dance should watch thi"
A Christmas Tale             ,FrenchEddieFelson,1,comedy,2019,8,"A plethora of awesome actors in perfect symbiosis, refined dialogues, a sense of humor very dark and even cynical, jubilant duels between brothers and sisters, a surrealistic conversation (a kind of 'I love you, neither do I') between a mother and her son, probabilistic calculations on life expectancy, ... It is a real delight but definitely not a Christmas tale. I loved this atypical, dysfunctional and weird family"
The Duchess             ,screenwriter-14,1,misc,2008,10,"THE DUCHESS is a simply beautiful film, with lush English locations and costumes that are out of this world, along with a cast of actors that you can thoroughly enjoy. Ralph Fiennes is at the top of his game as the Duke, and Kira Knightley continues to grow in stature and grace in a role as the Duchess which makes you immediately think of the late and extraordinary Princess Diana. Charlotte Rampling once again graces the screen with a regal air, and Dominic Cooper brings a solid performance as Mr. Grey. And, it is in the cinematography and sets and costumes that brings THE DUCHESS to life and gives it the sheen and polish of that era of opulence and lushness of the Royals. THE DUCHESS, like MARIE ANTOINETTE, serves up a rich piece of elegance, set around a story that makes you want to have a happy ending, but that would be a fairy tale. So, forget/ignore the critics, the soft reviews, and take in the story and intrigue which is THE DUCHESS"
Space Chimps             ,Mendelovich,,animation,2009,5,"This movie has nothing new for us except the freezing stuff on the alien planet. It was a long time since such an incoherent concoction was construed before us. The plot is almost impossible to bear or follow, due to its hops between different scenes, and the myriad of aliens, chimps and people. To top it all, the animation is quite inferior compared to Pixar's. So why was this movie done? If you love chimps to the point of being a fan, you can admire their virtues as the inheritors of corrupted people. Even the most free spirited chimp, represented by Ham IIIrd, can grasp itself and rise beyond the highest human moral"
The Escapist             ,son_of_cheese_messiah,,crime,2011,5,"This film has a lot of things going for it: a good cast, especially Brian Cox, a striking visual sense and some well written dialogue. However, it is let down by a number of arbitrary and confusing elements which do not gel to make a satisfying whole.One gets the impression of the British prison system is entirely run by the inmates with the indifferent warders looking on. Sadly this may be a fairly accurate portrayal of a modern British prison (although the living conditions are far more comfy than depicted here thanks to 'human rights'). But the impression is that certain scenes have been created just because they look good rather than because they serve any dramatic function. There's a strange and unexplained initiation ceremony for scantily clad newcomers; the now obligatory prison rape; and the lengthy intercut (apparent) escape scenes add to the confusion, even though they are highly atmospheric.The black drug baron is particularly ludicrous. He has an assortment of potions to hand which would make Harry Potter jealous. He's able to concoct a poisonous 'cat' substitute somewhere in the prison (not sure where, I didn't think that laboratories were standard requirements yet) over night.The 'surprise' ending merely added more questions rather than explaining anything. The comparison made to the Dallas shower scene made elsewhere is very apt"
Garden Party             ,BernardoLima,1,drama,2009,NA,"Garden Party tells us the story of several individuals, all of them living in L.A.We have a homeless boy musically gifted,a 15 year old girl raised by questionable parents,a young gay men only now figuring out who he is and what he wants in life and a sexy and successful real estate agent with a not so bright past who has a soft spot for losers. This are the main characters. Also part of the story are a rich pervert and a sleazy photographer. What do most of this characters have in common? A dream or a certain ambition but also lack of money...due to this fact they find themselves hanging out with the wrong crowd or doing things they never thought they would.Eventually their paths cross.I really enjoyed this film, maybe it was my fascination for L.A. or my appetite for Indies... I'm not sure but I thought it was great. Very original script and the acting was great,despite most of the cast being somewhat unknown.Willa Holland who's probably the best known actress in this cast gave a subtle performance but she is one to watch. The soundtrack was also very interesting. I loved the film, it felt incredible refreshing and I would definitely recommend this movie regardless of the low rating it has on this website.7.5/1"
The Bank Job             ,ZebraGreg,0,crime,2008,9,"Britain's MI-5 stages a robbery of London bank to steal back blackmail photos of Princess Margaret. MI-5 gets hooked up with Martine Love and Terry Leather, played by Saffron Burrows and Jason Statham, who are struggling at the margin between the criminal world and the ordinary world. In time, real gangsters, the Police and MI-5 are all chasing Terry's gang and roughing up each other. The movie is a grand bit of story telling. It is a great cops and robber story with lots if credible twists and turns. This is refreshing because we have all seen too many Hollywood crime pictures that are just too comical and science-fiction like Mission Impossible or Oceans 11+. It's entertaining, and would have been without its irrelevant nudity. This movie is not providing social commentary, or teaching us about history: it is just a fun story that is told well. Kudos to the writers, Clement and La Frendais. The performances are believable especially Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows --although the action oriented story does not test their range. The real star of this movie is the storyline."
Changeling             ,griffolyon12,1,misc,2008,10,"Changeling is the new film from director Clint Eastwood. It is based on a true story that takes place in 1928 L.A.The story is about a woman who returns home one day to find her son missing. Then a few months later the police return a child to her, but it isn't her son. The woman keeps on telling everyone that this child isn't her son, but the police keep on claiming that it is her son and are calling the woman crazy.The film is a wonderful study about police corruption in L.A. in the late 1920s. The film is emotionally gripping, and at times disturbing.The film was superbly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was working from a terrific script by J. Michael Straczynski. Not only that, but Eastwood also wrote the film's score, which was very good as well. Of course the acting is what truly stole the show for me. Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mother of the missing child, but what truly surprised me was how good these children in the cast were. All of the child actors were very well cast and all delivered amazing performances.As a whole Eastwood's Changeling is one of the best films of the year, and should be up for some big-time Oscars at year's end.A perfect 10 out of 10! 1"
Nim's Island             ,ntsci,1,adventure,2008,NA,"One of the best children fantasy films that I've ever seen. I'm really surprised at how low its rating is. Its amusing and fun and promotes important values such as courage, self-reliance, and heroism. It also does a great job in exploring what it means to be a hero and shows how a person can overcome the greatest phobias and other obstacles if motivated.I'm a bit tired of fantasy films that always end in battles. This was a film that you could show to the entire family.The DVD has some unusually interesting deleted scene that show a different take on the story.My congratulations to the film maker"
Bedtime Stories             ,mannysplace,0,adventure,2008,10,"My granddaughter, 11, picked the movie as I am generally a ScFi guy. I have to say that I enjoyed and laughed as much as she did. I didn't see anything hackneyed or clichéd moments lend itself to funny cookie cutter movies, except the role reversal with the waiter thing, but oddly enough, that can happen in real life...the movie moves at a nice brisk pace, making you want a little more depth at certain points such as sibling interaction, but it is about that phase between is Santa real and the real world. And yes Santa is real..No its not a Santa movie..take the kids to it and find out, enjoy, or vice versa, I recommend it highly. You will not feel leaving the movie ripped off by any means, which not surprisingly happens more often than not. May you all enjoy it as we did."
The Bank Job             ,bluey71,0,crime,2008,8,"I recommend this movie.The movie has a well thought out plot. It moves at a good pace that leaves you interested with the actual events in the film.The acting was well done. Jason Statham continues to be one of todays most under-appreciated and underrated actors. Yes, he does do some questionable action movies, but when you put him in a role where one actually needs to ""act"", he never disappoints.The dialog was ""catchy"" but still believable. The characters in this movie are believable in their ""sinister"" ways or their ""everyday joe"" kind of ways. You really do end up hating certain individuals and loving others. There are so many interesting characters that have an interest in the bank heist that you really do want to know how it all ends.There was no unnecessary violence just for the sake of violence and yet at points, it felt like an action thriller.In the end, this is a movie with a great plot, great characters, good dialog and an ending with no holes. AND this movie is missing the Hollywood ""over the top"" quality that has a tendency to ruin most movies.Definitely worth seeing"
Iron Man             ,VithDos,0,action,2008,8,"So the world premier of Iron man to regular movie going audiences happened to be here in Seoul Korea on an army installation. I got to check it out and I was delightfully surprised.Much against the hype, I thought this movie would have been torrid trash acting mingled with cheesy fight scenes. I mean Robert Downey Jr as an action superhero? But I am glad to admit that I misjudged the movie completely. Downey played a very good Tony Stark, in generally every way. From his jokes to his obnoxious lifestyle he looked and walked the part very well. His banter with his right hand assistant Ms. Pepper Potts isn't mind numbing and actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the wit.The movie itself moved at a very good pace. Mixing action, comedy and some drama to just about the right proportions. As with most superhero movies, its rather predictable, but in all the right ways you'd want a superhero movie to be. The animation used was almost seamless, and of course the Iron Man costume was kicking major ass.My only gripe with the movie was the fact that several characters were thrown into the mix with little behind them other than 2D character attributes. Leslie Bibb's character, Christine Everhart, is pretty useless other than the two or three lines she has. Hardly worth a hardbody like Leslie Bibb to play. Several other characters didn't feel fleshed out at all. Raza (Faran Tahir), Obediah Stone (Jeff Bridges) , and even Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) feel hollow in the fact that they have little justification for many of their actions.So All in all, I'd give this movie an 8.3. Fun for the whole family, great pacing, and a Superhero movie to give the next Batman movie a run for its money. 4"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,brent-leslie,0,drama,2009,4,"I can't see why others rate this film so highly. Maybe because people are so used to seeing visual trash from Hollywood these days, when they get visual trash with some good acting, they call it a masterpiece.Benjamin Button is a very well paced, visually affecting movie. But it is one that leaves you feeling hollow. The feel for the characters due to the skill of the actors, but you are given no understanding for their motivations. Why did the female lead desire so much to be a dancer? Where was Benjamins conflict about leaving his family? Layer that with the oh so obvious feeling that this was done before (and better) with Forrest Gump and you feel like this is a rehash of the same idea. Now throw in cliché after cliché (crazy sea captain, dancer struck down ridiculously in her prime, lovers buying a love nest and painting the walls...) and you end up feeling like you have gone on a ride, but it didn't make you feel any differently than when you got on. You can't identify or understand what has happened, so why is it important? Are we all so gullible these days that any movie with some enhanced visuals and good acting gets called a masterpiece?"
Lakeview Terrace             ,willidke,0,crime,2008,8,"So I have to be brutally honest here, I was mainly looking forward to see ""Lakeview Terrace"" because I really thought it was going to be awful. And it did look that way to me by the trailers. So I went to laugh at it, but when it started to keep getting better and better, I couldn't really laugh at it anymore. Now not saying that this movie does not have flaws, because IT DOES. But it surprised me with its thematic elements, and really suspenseful scenes. But the cons are that it is a really heavy PG-13 film, and I personally thought they could have made it 10 times better if they had crossed the line into 'R'(which wouldn't have taken much more) and really fleshed out some things that are just hinted at because of their content. And the main con to the film for me was that there was no message at the end of the movie. It just ended, no theme or statement about the story. Just ended without saying ""Now the moral of the story is..."" So overall I'd recommend this movie to you. The good out-weighs the bad and its really a lot of fun."
Ghost Town             ,m-vinteuil,0,misc,2008,2,"In the series Extras we were given Ricky Gervais's views on celebrity, and those who chase it at the cost of their integrity. Following Ricky's career from failed musician to ""tinpot"" radio DJ, to his success with The Office and the new medium of Podcasting, Ghost Town couldn't be a more blatant vehicle for selling out. It makes no sense. He was building the right kind of credibility in America with his appearance on The Simpsons, and cameo in For Your Consideration. A fan base of American comedy stalwarts like Larry David and Chris Rock, and a groundswell of interest in his Podcasts and stand-up, why would he suddenly sully all he has worked so hard for to make an in-flight rom-com? A pastiche of everything from A Christmas Carol, The Sixth Sense, Fawlty Towers, Groundhog Day and early Woody Allen films. Ghost Town is neither here nor there, and largely forgettable.The plot is certainly un-Gervais and concerns ghosts, something the atheist Ricky derides at every opportunity in his Podcasts. Missing a glaring opportunity to have Karl Pilkington appear as a blind ghost, casting is instead comprised of the most annoying actors in Hollywood today. Gervais's misanthrope works against the sappy script of redemption, as with a cast this irritating, the sardonic wit of the earlier Gervais is more likable compared to the sniveling wretch he has to become to get the girl.Gervais was attempting to finally break into Hollywood, which he would have done anyway if he had just kept being himself. Earlier this year he ripped the hell out of Karl Pilkington's film idea (a ludicrous romantic drama which stared Rebecca De Mornay and Clive Warren (sic)) for having a nonsense plot and cast of nobodies and has-beens. After seeing Ghost Town, I know who the money should have gone to"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,cameronwarn,0,action,2008,1,"Another in a list of very poor Hollywood follow-up films.....For a film where the makers continually talked of doing in-camera effects so as to match the original films and preserve continuity, there sure were a lot of CG effects. In fact, the very first shot of the film includes a CG character which served to me as a warning as to how the whole film was going to go.There are so many things wring with this film Its difficult to know where to start. The story for starters is a bit weak, and surely they could have found a non extra-terrestrial theme and picked something more interesting and based on some other interesting artifact from antiquity. Ford's character having a side career as a spy was ridiculous, as was the terrible character played be Blanchett. In fact, all of the characters were simply uninteresting and a waste of time for the actors who portrayed them.The action sequences seemed a bit old-hat and it was painfully obvious at times (such as the warehouse sequence) that Ford was a little over the hill for the role as the difference between his close-ups and the stunt-mans shots whose tempo did not match. Throughout the film there were several shots that do stand out in my mind, but maybe not for good reasons. Some of these included that ridiculous sequence with the fridge, the very 'Mummy' like ant effects, the awful shot introducing Shia LaBeouf, those stupid monkeys and gophers and probably most notably the dime store looking, cling-wrap filled plastic skull which was meant to be what the whole film was about!!For some reason Hollywood does not seem to be able to produce any decent follow-up films recently, and this is no exception. I can only wonder at how much influence Lucas had over the filming and post production of this film, but it really feels like 'Phantom Menace Syndrome' with its lack of story, character development, style, excitement or any virtue worth going to see an adventure film for. It simply is not anything like the original 3 films which were great fun to watch and still are. The direction of the film feels like a first time director who does not know where the film is going and simply cannot get a grip on the material. It disappoints me greatly that this film is so woefully dull, as with its great cast and director it really was the last thing that I would have expected. There are a few nice moments between Ford and Allens characters, but these are counted in low single digit numbers. The films greatest crime is that is just not a fun film. I personally don't think of an CG driven film when I think of this franchise but this is what they gave us this time and quite frankly, I would rather go watch The Mummy for that kind of film and its certainly no piece of art either! 1"
Death Race             ,Jonny_Numb,0,action,2009,1,"Jason Statham plays one type of character, but he almost always plays it to perfection: the suave, stubbly, and sometimes smarmy would-be Bond from madcap B movies like ""Crank"" and ""Ghosts of Mars."" Casting him as the lead in any film brings certain expectations<U+0096>basically, that our muscled mofo will deliver a smackdown to the badguys while delivering some catchy one-liners.Paul W.S. Anderson is a director who makes one type of movie (granted, his ""Mortal Kombat"" is my only point of reference): the uber-rotten video game warm-over shot like something even more ADHD than a music video. His masturbatory editing makes the works of Michael Bay look patient and subtle by comparison.So, after a year of being perpetually disappointed in Hollywood blockbusters and franchise revivals (oh, Indy, how could you?), ""Death Race"" has given me something worthy of hate, and deserving of the dishonor of being the worst film of 2008. When Statham is stripped of his predictable (yet consistent) charisma, someone has messed up something awful.Inspired by the cult classic ""Death Race 2000,"" this is a prime example of a remake done wrong, where ear-splitting sound and migraine-inducing camera moves make one feel trapped inside a two-hour earthquake. The action doesn't thrill, and the characters are developed through egregious one-liners and cliché events. In 2012, the economy has collapsed, and an American public (the upper-class only, I guess) eager to let off some steam finds their opiate in ""Death Race,"" a pay-per-view event where prisoners condemned to die on Terminal Island vie for the ultimate prize: freedom. It's an old premise, but one that has been retooled to entertaining effect in other films.Even lousier than the dialog and Anderson's attention-deficit technique is the characters, who are not only a catalog of bland stereotypes (Family Man framed for a crime he didn't commit; Stuttering Nerd; Hardened Old Sage; and the token Hip-Hop Styled Badass), but utterly fail to convince us for a second that they're hardened killing machines deserving of their sentence. As a result, the bloodshed that ensues is pedestrian and ineffectual (and even worse when played for ironic effect); while the outcome of ""Death Race"" is as predictable as you would expect, the total lack of B-movie charm (and fun) is simply unforgivable.Stranded in this murk is Joan Allen, who, as the black-hearted warden Hennessy, seems to be channeling an androgynous cross between Louise Fletcher and Keanu Reeves, but is relegated to standing around watching monitors while delivering Anderson's subpar dialog. What should come across as icy, methodical menace (with maybe a bit of tongue-in-cheek irony) is instead sleepwalking boredom, proving that great actors cannot always salvage terrible scripts. When even the head villain is a cliché devoid of personality (to the point where her eventual fate elicits total indifference), you know you have messed up something awful.For all its efforts to pummel on a miserably superficial level, ""Death Race"" left me feeling nothing<U+0096>not empathy for the characters, not excitement at the alleged ""action"" (which is cut so rapidly it's next to impossible to tell what's happening, and where), just a void left unfilled by anything resembling experience. It's a waste of time and talent, plain and simple."
Kung Fu Panda             ,firstname-lastname-2,0,animation,2008,8,I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again. 1
Shutter             ,peelscreen,0,horror,2008,1,"I think this movie shows exactly how Hollywood sees America's youth. Compelled by fashionably dressed model women, sometimes half naked, bright colors, spooky images and scenes that are only there to make you jump. Oh... and I forgot, no brains. They think you're all idiots so they give you this cliché garbage.Skinny attractive woman who couldn't act if it were cursed on her, walks around always looking fresh and dumb in designer clothes. This movie is about as intelligent as a log. Everything seems forced and none of it is original or done in a compelling way. I have to wonder if English was the native language of the director since most of the dialog is unacceptably terrible. Many times I cringed or laughed at things that I knew weren't meant to have that kind of reaction.Poorly paced, poorly written, poorly acted, the effects are okay. I haven't seen the original, but conceptually, this movie could have been great if it were done the right way. Unfortunately, it was not. F- 1"
Twilight             ,Kykuit,1,misc,2009,1,"So, so very bad. Robert Pattinson, the male lead, is made-up like the Avon Lady. Nikki Reed looks like one of the black guys in White Chicks and Kristen Stewart was as wooden and flat as a living human being can possibly be. The special effects are not equal to 50's TV and the script was painful to hear. Perhaps that is why the actors performed on something equal to middle-school level.The sooner this tasteless little flick fades away, the better.I assume Summit is rushing to complete the rest of the movies before the fan base grows up and develops some sense of taste.Oh well, you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear."
Deception             ,kevin_crighton,0,crime,2008,4,"Jonathan McQuarry, is an accountant who strikes up a friendship with a lawyer called Wyatt Bose. After accidentally swapping phones, McQuarry starts getting calls from women who are part of a group of people who meet purely for casual sexual encounters. During one of these, McQuarry meets a blonde woman whom he becomes close to. When he's attacked and she disappears, he discovers more going on than he realized....From the above plot description some people can figure out where the story is heading. I for one did. It's a sad fact that the script written by Mark Bomback holds no surprises at all. It also doesn't help that there are plot holes that aren't explained or dealt with. The direction by Marcel Langenegger is okay, but he doesn't add any tension into the movie.What does save the movie are the three main performances. Michelle Williams is suitably enigmatic as the girl involved, Hugh Jackman as Wyatt Bose brings charm and charisma to the part, and Ewan McGregor as Jonathan McQuarry convinces as the straight, lonely accountant seduced into the events played out.However the performances alone can't save the movie from being a disappointing, predictable thriller.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,wittmann73,0,action,2008,NA,"Before I start my review let me say I am a huge Indy fan and have been waiting for this movie for 19 years.Bad news first : Number 4 is the weakest of the Indy films. Good news : It is still good entertainment.Let me explain further :The Good : Harrison Ford still IS Indiana Jones. He still has the magic to impersonate this character. You really see his efforts to make this film work. Great camera work and sets. Shia LaBoef is actually quite good and not annoying at all, he has some funny lines and scenes. I never regretted that he was in the movie. Some really good action scenes, esp. in the first half of the movie with believable stunts and not too much CGI, e.g. the motorbike chase or the Warehouse battle. Great! Humor was OK and many jokes worked for me (best : the quicksand scene).The Bad :John Hurt as Oxley looked like Dumbledore on Ecstasy. I didn't like his character very much and was glad when he finally became ""sane"" again. Problem was by then the movie was almost over. Sorry guys, Karen Allen. She was overacting too much, smiling and laughing all the way even during the deadliest action sequences like a soccer mum. We know she is tough and so but it never felt believable. Also her interaction and reunion with Ford seemed a bit forced. The Villains : Blanchet was OK, but not very menacing or intimidating. You never felt she was a threat to Indy. She was always behind him. Russians? Give me Nazis as adversaries any day. Ray Winstons character (forgot the name) was confusing and underdeveloped : ""I am on your side, no wait I am a traitor, oh wait I am CIA, never mind I am a traitor again"". WTF? Ant scene : Stolen straight from ""The Mummy"". Shame on you, Spielberg.The Ugly :Sorry, but the last third of the film was the pits. The jungle chase was far ""over the top"" action, I thought Indy and Mutt were human beings, not supermen. They pulled off moves and jumps that even Spiderman couldn't do. Indy not using his gun once. At least he didn't carry a walky-talky instead. Nuclear explosion scene. OMG. How embarrassing, who came up with this idea? What was supposed to be funny only got howls of disbelieve and ""Yeah right"" from the audience. Indy survives a nuclear explosion in a fridge (!) and then is whirled away miles through the air, exits the fridge and walks off? Was Spielberg on drugs when he filmed this? Who on earth could survive such an explosion? I couldn't believe it! The plot : Not very suspenseful. Parts of it even boring. Aliens? They waited 19 years for this script? I believe almost anything would have been better. At least the Aliens only appear during the last minutes.All in all a small disappointment but still a watchable Indy movie. I think ""less would have been more"" in this case. More believable stunts, less CGI and a better script and the movie would have rocked. I blame Spielberg and Lucas. Kudos to Ford. Should have made Indy IV 10 years earlier.I give it a 5/10 despite all the negative points. First third of the movie 8/10, rest 2/10. 730"
Goodbye Solo             ,binaryg,0,drama,2010,4,"I'm always trolling for movies. Sometimes a film will arrive in the mail and I'll have no idea why I rented it. When I got ""Goodbye Solo"" I checked its rating at the Metacritic site and instantly realized why I'd rented it. It was a small independent film with a super high (89 average) approval rating. I expected to be moved and entertained. I'd seen ""The Taste of Cherry"" a few months ago and thought it was stunning. ""Solo"" had a similar plot line.I watched ""Solo"" and waited for it to work its magic but nothing happened for me and I felt the end to be no end at all. What will happen to all of these characters after the film ended? Worse I didn't really care. As I read the critics and users reviews here I can understand how someone might be very moved by it all and feel the ending profound but it left me cold.I believe a hint of why I reacted that way to ""Solo"" lay in an experience I had last year with ""Happy-Go-Lucky,"" another independent, quirky film that interested me because of its critical reception. I watched it and loved it and gave it the highest rating and recommended it to friends. Then one night I watched it with a couple of friends I was sure would like it. I began watching ""Happy"" with them and was laughing in the spots I had laughed the first time though until I noticed my friends weren't laughing in the right spots or at all and eventually I realized they were really disliking it. We stopped it a couple of times to talk a little about what wasn't working for them and by the end of ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" I was agreeing with them and couldn't figure out why the film had such an impact on me the first time. Poppy just didn't work for me after it was pointed out to me how unrealistic here character was.I'm not usually a film buff whose opinion is easily swayed by others. But now I'm wondering if my friends may have ruined the quirky independent film genre for me. It's possible based on my experience with ""Goodbye Solo,"" but I sure hope no"
WALL·E             ,seaview1,0,animation,2008,9,"Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube. He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence. Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe. Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve. Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably. Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love. On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control. Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination. It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character. He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would. He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid. Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home. Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly. I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling. Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features. In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults. Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement. The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human! Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president. Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films. The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camera-work. The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space. Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those 'save the earth' and 'think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story. There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor. It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience. Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us. "
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,jlongstreth-1,,adventure,2010,NA,"I loved the novel Mysteries of Pittsburgh. It took place in familiar surroundings, places I hung out, in a town I loved. It questioned mysteries that I'd questioned myself.It's not certain if the passage of time or the changes wrought in adaptation brought about my dislike for this movie. After all, I first read the book some 25 years ago. But the film lacks so much in comparison with the book. It has none of the humor, none of the introspection, none of the sense of resolution or at least readiness at the end.The acting does not help the situation, especially Sienna Miller, who as Jane, is basically a flat line. Art is nearly a flat line, strangely enough; as the lead he is not supposed to be. Sarsgaard's Cleveland attempts to compensate for the affectless performance of his screen-mates by wildly over-emoting. It's a valiant effort that almost works. And Mena Suvari is just pitiful as a sad stereotype that no woman with a shred of self-respect should ever have to play on screen or stage.I'm sure it doesn't help my assessment that Chabon is one of my favorite writers and Pittsburgh is my beloved home city. But if I were you, I'd give this one a miss. The four stars are for cinematography Nick Nolte, and music, which were decen"
The Dark Knight             ,Mush_Man29,0,action,2008,10,"I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray! 1,190"
Untraceable             ,DICK STEEL,1,crime,2008,6,"So I thought I'd take a break from the Festival and get down to some regular screening of what some would deem as the usual products from the usual assembly line. Untraceable became that movie, because the poster here had Ebert giving it a positive rating, but everyone else I heard had panned it. Directed by Gregory Hoblit, who was at the helm of one of my favourite movies Frequency, I thought I'd give it a shot.The premise was interesting enough to appeal to geeks, at least some parts of it. A serial killer with the technical know-how sets up a site, and uses the power of the internet as well as the voyeuristic nature of the online denizens to aid in the kills, meaning the more hits the site receives during an online, live execution, the faster the victim will die. Needless to say should he slap an ad on the site, it'll rake him enough dough to retire. And the police can't do anything about it because of bureaucratic red tape in terms of jurisdictions, and of course, the killer being a gifted cracker.In the veins of torture porn movies, it does showcase some rather sick though innovative ways of brutally dispatching someone, although it doesn't resort to ramping up the gore element unnecessarily. There were some nifty visual effects and makeup, but for those weaned on the Saw franchise and its wannabes, then Untraceable doesn't provide anything new. So goes the usual cliché storyline of cops, led by Diane Lane's FBI Agent Jennifer Marsh, Colin Hanks' Agent Griffin Dowd and Portland Detective Eric Box (BIlly Burke), going after the elusive killer whose only presence is online, until it becomes personal and hits closer to home with the obvious plot development involving family and friends.But unlike its title, there's nothing much untraceable about this hunter and prey game, and provides you with very little connection or psychological challenge in outwitting, outlasting and outplaying each other. It doesn't attempt to build up the great ""unknown"" about the killer in a whodunnit fashion, and only weaves through a connection of convenience. However, Untraceable does have genuinely tension building moments, and you do find yourself sitting at the edge of your seat during certain segments, but that's about it, as the rest of the time, it's just plain sailing in expected waters.I felt that while it had some message to say about online netizens and anonymous chatter in general, it doesn't quite achieve what it had set out to do. You get to see snapshots of essentially a chatroom with its mindless discussions and terrible shorthand with typos, which probably is something you'd be accustomed to should you visit any chatroom anyway. Also, Hollywood still couldn't get away from designing some really snazzy login menus and user interfaces that end users in the real world will probably drool over, or laugh at its cumbersomeness.What really plummeted the movie to B-grade movie territory is the ending. No worries, no spoilers here, but really, it ended with plenty of bravado and the cheese was just too thick to swallow. Seriously, watching Diane Lane did whatever she did, sent my eyeballs rolling upwards sky high. Promising premise which didn't allow for its plot to keep pace."
The Burning Plain             ,soha_bayoumi,1,misc,2009,8,"This is the first feature directing experience for Guillermo Arriaga. Already an established writer (Amores Perros, Babel, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada), Arriaga promisingly directs his own script in this movie. The movie follows the characteristic feature of Arriaga's script: fragmented stories, sometimes happening simultaneously, and sometimes happening at different time periods. The editing is intriguing, prompting you to try and seek connections between the different stories. The performances are amazing (especially Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger's). The landscape choices and the cinematography are beautiful. The Burning Plain is a poignant story about desperation, betrayal, trauma, revenge, guilt and self-hatred, with the stories of three female characters and different ""plains"" burningly interwoven to deliver a moving depiction of these themes... Highly recommended!"
The Ruins             ,Dragoneyed363,,adventure,2008,8,"The Ruins was an impressive achievement and all out great gory fun, in my honest opinion. While the characters aren't really likable, the movie itself is so entertaining and interesting that it makes up for the obvious solid plot and professional development it lacks. While it's certainly not a masterpiece, The Ruins is just an instantaneous breath of fresh air. It's clever in a sense, creepy to the bone and new with an insane entertainment level that it keeps your attention and doesn't let go.I found the ""creatures"" an effective and nice, sinister twist to deal with next to the other conflict of being stranded upon the Mayan ruins away from all civilization except the natives who are hellbent on letting them die up there, and I thought while the characters were stupid, that was the right way to handle the situation considering that most people would lose their wit in situations like that after some time, and I always like it when horrors try to make their characters believable, because that makes up for them not being special. It was so compellingly good just to watch what all happened, and I really enjoyed the scenes and thought that it had excellent suspense and a wonderful atmosphere of claustrophobia and paranoia.Yes, it gets a little bland around the edges, and like I said, it's not like it ranks among the greatest films of all time, but I truly do think it is a satisfying taste of what effective, legendary horrors could do if they were made with better care, because it has all the right substances, but just falls flat a little with it's slight mediocrity. Regardless, it is nonetheless very amusing and indulging. I praise the creators for coming as far as they did with a poor direction, and for toppling over a lot of horrors that have been made in the past decade. Too bad more people didn't see what I did, because it is quite underrated and under appreciated, I think. "
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,sirengarg,1,adventure,2008,10,"I expected this movie to be nothing but childish antics to make the kiddies laugh. Fart and burp jokes, bathroom humor, and nothing more than another movie propaganda that lies to audiences on how great a certain breed of dog are that then get people to impulse buy it, and dump it 6 months to a year later at the shelter (ala 101 Dalmations). Apparently Disney finally listened to the 100s of letters and petitions asking them to stop making the same cookie-cutter dog movie.First, the trailers make you think Papi is the top dog in this movie. Its actually Chloe, the female chihuahua that the movie focuses on. If not for the supporting cast, the movie would have likely sucked. I was surprised at the heavy issues they dealt with in the movie and how well executed it was.For one...Chloe is lost and found by a man who brings her to a dog fighting ring. Yes, dog fighting in a Disney movie. Though don't be getting memories of White Fang. This dog fighting ring is not shown so bloodthirsty. You KNOW its a bad place. There are all sorts of dogs there, of several breeds. Pit bulls, German Shepherd, mastiffs, and dobermans. One of the pit bull mixes is sadly praying in Spanish. One of the other dogs says, ""he always prays before a fight"". Chloe was brought there to be a bait dog. They never use the words ""bait dog"". But they put her in the ring with El Dialbo, a bad-ass doberman. Delgado, a German shepherd breaks out of his cage, and releases the rest of the dogs, then he saves Chloe and all the dogs run for the hills. The owner of the fighting ring notices last minute that Chloe is wearing a diamond collar and knows she's worth money and sends El Diablo to find her.Papi and his owner, as well as the woman entrusted to care for Chloe go to Mexico to find her. They come upon two of the former fighters, a mastiff mix and a pit bull mix and they join them. On their journey, both dogs get adopted. We also find out Papi is adopted too. And at the end of the flick, a message to the audience about researching a breed before you get it and adopting over buying.On stereotyping Mexicans, as a Hispanic American, I was not insulted in the least. You have the hero (human), who is Mexican, working as a landscaper, yes...stereotype, but they used that stereotype deliberately to show you how wrong people are. The heroine (human) insults him by assuming he can only speak Spanish and talks down to him in her own form of Spanish. He goes along with it. But with Jaime Lee Curtis character you see he is not just the hired help, but a member of her family as far as they are concerned. The millionaire seems to look at him as a son or nephew. And she treats his shelter dog, Papi very well too. In Mexico itself, you see people helping them out all the time. Yes, some of the places they go are not the nicer sides of town, but the people are good. I think the only people who have anything to complain about here are Dobermon owners. They kept from stereotyping all the other ""dangerous breeds"" but them.It was no award winner, it was never meant to be. But it was a great family flick that doesn't talk down to youngsters and its side stories were fantastic. Hopefully this movie makes future adopters out of kids and parents."
Fireflies in the Garden             ,slsmoot123,0,drama,2013,4,"I'm not a literary genius or anything but this movie left me totally confused. Why did it seem like everyone was beating up on Michael, the one who had been abused? Even the aunt Jane whom I thought would have been the most understanding had zero empathy for Michael and defended the father to the death. She said that the book would kill the father (William Dafoe). Well, so effing what if it does? At least the writer could have let the audience know why she cared so much, after all her relation is to Lisa not the father so it makes absolutely no sense to me. She said to Michael ""everything you touch turns to sh**"", where did that come from? In my eyes it was totally unwarranted and if it had been me she would have gotten punched in the teeth for saying it. Then she never apologized even after Michael found her son. So it just seems like continued abuse on the abused. Then to throw the Manuscript in the fire is supposed to be a sign of forgiveness? So Michael's supposed to feel guilty for his father's sins? What!? Come on....It would have been a better movie if Jane didn't grow up to be such a turncoat b**c"
The Square             ,eadwinn,0,crime,2011,9,"People rip this movie for not having a ""credible plot"" -- I think it's a ridiculous complaint, when that is exactly the point of the movie: it gets so tangled up, things go so over-the-top terribly wrong, that it becomes a black comedy. It's an intensively cruel, sadistic play on director/writer's N. Edgerton's part, who had shown his morbid and absurd sense of humor prior with the ingenious short feature ""Spider"", and it's at the heart of this movie.The lead character of the movie, Raymond Yale descends into noir hell: every step he takes is a misstep, and every misstep leads him into bigger and bigger mess. The Square is intense, absurd, suspenseful, and outrageously fun."
The Lucky Ones             ,nturner,,adventure,2009,7,"Three soldiers who have received non life threatening wounds in Iraq are together on a plane to New York. Two of them are on thirty day leaves while the other has served his time and is on his way home. Due to a power outage, all flights out of New York have been canceled. The three agree to rent a car together in order to continue the trip to their destinations. Thus begins a road trip that is highly dramatic with its share of comic events.Fred Cheaver is the middle aged father figure of the three - a man who never really expected to do anything in the army except serve his domestic reserve duty. He is glad to be rid of the whole thing and is headed home to his wife and son. The two young soldiers who accompany Fred are Colee Dunn and T.K. Poole. Colee is a bright-eyed innocent who is on a mission for a fallen comrade who saved her life. T.K. is a no nonsense soldier from a family of soldiers who plans to make the army his career and move up the chain of command.Whereas, Fred's quest is to return home to wife and son, Colee's and T.K.'s goals are to travel to Las Vegas for two entirely different reasons. Colee wants to return her dead comrade's treasured guitar to his family. T.K.'s reason is somewhat mysterious, but we know it is related in some way to his injury that has left him temporarily impotent.As with all road trip films, the experiences and interactions of these three lead to conclusions not expected by them or the viewers.Unlike most films featuring vets returning from the horrors of war, this film is not filled with dark angst - not to say the characters are not well-fleshed and genuine. These three are real people with real problems, but their depictions are not heavy-handed.During this film, the viewer gets to enjoy the work of three excellent actors. Tim Robbins gives his usual fine, understated performance as the older man facing some totally unexpected twists of fate. Rachel McAdams gives Colee a likable innocence but also reveals some darker layers of her character. Michael Peña is very, very good as the macho guy with a heart who only wants to be a good soldier. Watching these three interact is a real treat.Some may consider the treatment of the subject matter of this film too light handed, but it has a gentleness that rings true. It is surely worth watching."

The author is actually not the rugged swashbuckler adventurer in Nim's imagination, but Alexandra Rover(Jodie Foster), petite and germ obsessed, who lives like a hermit in her San Francisco apartment. Alexandra has hit a writer's block and wants to see for herself the volcano Jack had written about in National Geographic. She makes it to the tropical paradise and helps Nim wait out her father's return. Foster is at times humorous playing second fiddle to a too-damn cutsie, cutsie Bresli"
Kung Fu Panda             ,yellocar,0,animation,2008,10,"Caught a screening of ""The Panda"" and all I can say is wow! I took my 6 year old daughter, who has the attention span of a 6 year old, and she wants to see it again. So do I! Jack Black is not only half of the greatest band in the world, he is also a fine voice actor. His flawed character, Po the Panda is very refreshing. So is this film. After having to sit through the boring ""Over the Hedge"" and the last two ""Shrek"" messes, I really appreciated an animated feature form Dreamworks that didn't have too many celeb voices all competing for screen time. This is Jack Black's movie. He has 75% of the lines in the script and that is not a bad thing. Don't just drop the kids off to see Kung Fu Panda. Go with them. I think it's one of those rare movies like The Incredibles and Finding Nemo that adults can enjoy as much as the kids. 2"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,joliefille411,0,drama,2009,1,"Honestly, I cannot start out saying anything other than this movie was complete rubbish from the ground up. At first sight, it seems to hold such promise: an interesting hook, renowned actors, as well as being based on a short (HA! more on that later...) story of F. Scott Fitzgerald's. I even paid to see it non-matinée the week it was released- a rarity for me. Yet all the overblown actors and excessive ad campaigns and self-congratulating awards shows in the world could not disguise what this film truly was.First off, the acting. I love Cate Blanchette, truly I do, but if she could do no better with her hackneyed portrayal of a Deep Southern accent, she did not deserve her role. In fact, both of the leads sounded so bad it would have been laughable had it not been so entirely insulting. I have lived all over the Southeastern US and have yet to encounter people who sounded so overdone and idiotic. Also, there was no way Cate could possibly hope to pass for early twenties. They should have taken their cue from Pitt's people and filmed her back-lit in complete shadows for the younger scenes. As for Brad Pitt, I have always been leery of him- I only ever hear of the man as an Adonis rather than an actor. Next time I will stick to my instincts- his pretty face did little to cover for his wooden lack of talent. It seems that all his contracts ever require of him is that he bang the hot chick. At least he got one part right.Which brings me to my next point- the absolutely sickening way Hollywood treats sex. It's so commonplace, so vulgar. Apparently, you are not a man, nay, not even a whole human being until you've shagged someone, even if its a hooker. Never mind that the character was supposed to only be mentally 13 (felony, anyone?). Or that no regard was given to the repercussions of such numerous encounters with people he had little other relation with. It's as if they wanted to see how long they could stretch out a film on pure bs. In fact, did this character exist for any other reason that to brag about his sexual irresponsibility in an outrageous southern drawl? Beats me.Even more curious than the case of the missing plot, was the mystery of the missing logic. Where was the racial tension of black adults raising a white child in New Orleans? Where was the brain of the policeman when Crazed Daddy Button came back with no ugly baby? Where was the sorcerer that was responsible for said ugly baby and the mysterious clock of doom we kept cutting to? Where were the obviously blind doctors and reporters that just happened to never realize the man was AGEING BACKWARDS? Not even a lone tormentor of this freak of nature? I've never known a person with life this good- everyone accepts him, wants to shag him, forgives him at a whim, and takes care of him no matter the personal cost. And all the while he is looking more and more like Brad Pitt. Am I seriously supposed to feel sorry for him? Everyone dies, everyone eventually reverts to a state where they can't care for themselves. I'm pretty sure that impermanence is when people keep telling me makes life SPECIAL. So shut up grow some, please.And then, to put the cherry on the sundae, our brave hero decides that it's just not fair for his lady friend he's knocked up to have to eventually raise two kids, so what does he do? He abandons her to raise one totally alone and travel the world seeking out more hookers to ease his pain. Oh tut, tut, life's just not fair, is it? Of course, he does actually come back when he can't change his diapers himself anymore, therefore negating any possible shred of nobility he supposedly professed. And all the while this is treated as the greatest sacrifice known to humankind. More like the greatest selfishness. I could go on like this for years, but I think my point has been sufficiently made.The friend on my right side during the film wept at the end, calling it the deepest film he'd ever seen. The depth must have overwhelmed the one to my left, because after dragging on for 3 hours for no discernible reason, all she could think of was when would it end so she could go to the toilet. I am inclined to agree with the latter: there are better things I could do with my time than watch this movie, among them, go to the toilet."
Iron Man             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,action,2008,NA,"Unlike pretty much all the superhero movies out there other than the Hellboy movies, I found ""Iron Man"" improved on second viewing. I'd go as far as saying that it's the best superhero film to date, although I'd have to see ""Hellboy II"" again before being sure about it. This film is near perfect as a summer entertainment. Light and largely insubstantial, but still not dumb in the slightest, and actually featuring some interesting writing for Tony Stark. The standard-issue moral dilemmas are handled well, without the stifling seriousness and heavy-handedness which sometimes let down the Nolan Batman films. We care about the dilemmas not necessarily due to their nature but because Tony Stark is such a convincing character.I'm going to be drawing comparisons to ""The Dark Knight"" throughout this 'review'. I do so not because I dislike ""The Dark Knight"" (in fact until a few hours ago I thought I liked it a tad more than ""Iron Man""), but because I'm attempting to make a case for ""Iron Man"" as the best summer blockbuster released in 2008, and the best superhero film to date. ""The Dark Knight"" is often praised for being more adult and darker than any other superhero film to date. First off, 'more adult' and 'darker' aren't necessarily the same thing. ""The Dark Knight"" is, on paper, really not all that more ludicrous than ""Iron Man"", nor is it a better story, nor are the characters more interesting. Bruce Wayne barely exists in ""The Dark Knight"", Rachel Dawes isn't up to much, Harvey Dent's transformation isn't all that convincing.Beyond just that, the film is stiflingly dark and humorless, almost to a fault because, well, it is about a guy walking around in a batsuit and fighting a maniac in clown makeup and a guy with half a face. The dialogue is often of an obviously expository nature. Where ""The Dark Knight"" is better than ""Iron Man"" is in the visual style. It also boasts a better villain. On the other hand, ""Iron Man"" is a straightforward superhero movie. It's odd, after so many superhero films, to finally see one which really feels like reading a superhero comic. I am not a fan of Iron Man or Marvel in general, but have read some good Iron Man comics in the past, and this film so wonderfully captures the nature of a superhero comic. Sure, Jeff Bridges' villain isn't great, but he fits very nicely into the story of the movie. The story's really very good too. The real heart of the film though is with Iron Man himself. While I give a lot of credit to Robert Downey Jr., who gives a performance which, like Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight"", is well beyond the standard for popcorn fare. The complaints about the film having no character development are also pretty unwarranted. Granted, Pepper Potts isn't up to much, but what really matters is Tony Stark himself and I found him not only convincingly portrayed but quite excellently-written as well. The film is concerned with the origins of Iron Man, not with the origins of Tony Stark. We hear about his father, we see what he was like before being in captivity, but the film doesn't bother with the usual clichéd approach which basically usually means the character is defined by two, maybe three if you're lucky, big, clichéd events in his life. All we need to know for this specific film (there's more to come from Iron Man, let's not forget) is who Tony Stark is NOW, and what went through his head after being in captivity and building the suit. With that in mind I felt ""Iron Man"" provided a well-rounded lead character, much more interesting than Bruce Wayne in ""The Dark Knight"" and more substantial than Hellboy or Peter Parker or pretty much most of the rest with specific regard to the movie incarnations of the characters.The screenplay's wise approach to the origin story means it can focus on the story. It's all pretty standard-issue stuff but done well, and while not insightful or deep or anything it certainly isn't a totally lunkheaded approach to the subject matter: the impact of weapons technology and advancements in the field on the world. Also what really matters is that it's a tight, lean screenplay, and while the climactic battle is a little underwhelming (and unfortunately starts feeling a bit like ""Transformers""), it is at least very well-shot, with a sort of clarity which helps all the action scenes here shine. The film is a well-made, tightly-constructed movie which is as long as it should be, and one which strikes a solid balance between character and story. Robert Downey Jr. is a big part of the film's success, no doubt, but credit should go to director Jon Favreau and the writers as well, because they really managed to deliver a movie that's a hell of a lot of fun, and one with easily the best central character in any superhero movie to date, and I say this as someone who definitely doesn't count Iron Man as their favorite superhero as far as comics go."
Street Kings             ,amesmonde,,misc,2016,NA,"An infamous undercover cop becomes a pawn when he is implicated in the murder of his former partner.What could have been an average police corruption thriller is elevated by Keanu Reeves, the supporting actors and David Ayer's kinetic slick direction. Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie and Chris Evans are on form. Notable is Terry Crews as ill-fated Terrence Washington. Reeves delivers the flawed alcoholic cop Detective Tom Ludlow successfully, while the role may not be as suitable as John Wick, it certainly one of his more dramatic roles. The film stands in the shadow of the like of Training Day (2001) but has enough punch, with bloody hard hitting scenes to stand on its own. It's probably on par with the comparable Dark Blue (2002, Ayer incidentally wrote the screenplay) but unavoidably falls into the trappings of the genre. Ayer's is wise to use a predominately on location shoot and portray graphic violence to give credence and weight to the proceedings. As Ludlow is set up and goes about uncovering a deeper conspiracy screenplay writers, the profound James Ellroy and underrated Kurt Wimmer successfully dot i's and cross the t's crafting a satisfying if somewhat predictable tale. The ending emulates the feeling of the closing of Dirty Harry (1971). Always topical and prevalent, I suppose you can never have too many films which highlight the pitfalls of greed and corruption. Overall, formulaic yet entertainin"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,bc1440,1,adventure,2008,7,"I agree with some of the previous reviewers - how can you rate a movie without even seeing it?!? Well, guess that gives us the right to rate THEM without even knowing them! I give those people a 1.5.This is a KID'S movie and to rate it a 2 is ridiculous. It's not the best movie but it sure is much better than A LOT of recent kid's/animated films. My kids, 4 & 5, loved this movie and that's really my biggest requirement. There are many others where they were bored and wanted to leave in less than 30 minutes.To the people voting it so low (especially ones who vote without viewing) - GET A LIFE! 1"
The Women             ,GayActivist,1,comedy,2008,3,"I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at the movies.I LOVE the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. This may have been the problem but I do not think so, because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work.Bette was under used and Anne was over used and miscast.I do not know why English or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition.They billed this as a Sex in the City but better? Not a chance I liked Sex in the City a lot and was disappointed by this movie.So do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this!"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,refresh_daemon,1,comedy,2008,8,"An amusing and sometimes awkward breakup film, this pic was written by and stars a long-time Apatow cohort, Jason Segel. The pic centers on lost, hypersensitive slacker Peter, who after being broken up with by his TV star girlfriend copes with its end poorly, eventually escaping to Hawaii where he subsequently books himself into a hotel that she is coincidentally staying at.Immediate warning to those sensitive to full frontal male nudity: it is present and more than once. That out of the way, the pic was pretty affable, containing more than a handful of good laughs as well as more than a lot of generally comically captured sex scenes. Many of the secondary characters also play enjoyably silly roles. And there is a funny musical component to the pic that also includes an amusing rendition of puppet-related works.I suppose I do have to level a little criticism for the theme being a little slight, but there still is something to be said for healing of personal wounds and learning to ""move on"". Those that have seen other Apatow relationship pics will probably see a number of similarities (slacker dude learns to grow up, gross out comedy, etc), even though Apatow didn't write or direct this piece. The film is also a bit on the long side, like many comedies that come from the Apatow crew and you do notice it. Some judicious trimming and relegating of some scenes (including numerous flashbacks) to DVD extras would've been helpful.Finally, I wish that more character could be drawn from both Sarah Marshall and Peter's newfound love interest, hotel employee Rachel as they played fairly two-dimensional, but I'm glad that Sarah didn't end up a one-note character as well. I didn't love the conclusion of the breakup story arc because I felt that it was a bit of a cop-out, but it didn't ruin the film. Lastly, Peter was written a little on the edge of believability in terms of being oversensitive, so you really have to buy his character, otherwise the film will break on you.Essentially, this is a congenial, enjoyable, but rude/crude film with a share of laughs and more Jason Segel than you probably ever wanted to see. Recommended for those who like some story with their laughs and can handle the vulgar, sexual, and nude content. 8/10."
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,lexi-25,1,misc,2008,3,"**Contains Spoilers** I went to see this movie expecting to see not only a chick flick, but a good one. I was disappointed greatly. Blake Lively's acting has gone downhill. She seemed so real, and able to relate to in the first movie. In this one, her poor acting made me laugh. Also, Alexis Bledel's acting hasn't improved much either. I loved her in Gilmore Girls, and her acting has never been like this before. Since I like both of these actresses, I'm thinking it might have been the director who brought out the fake parts these actresses. The movie itself was a mixture of the 3 books, and I think they mixed them up weird. The story line was a little all over the place, and not really well thought out. I loved the books, and was expecting this movie to be as good or better than them. I was wrong. Don't waste your money on this one- go to the dollar-fifty theater, if you have to see it at all"
The Ruins             ,Lando_Hass,,adventure,2008,7,"I just screened The Ruins and didn't think much of it beforehand. I thought it looked cool, but didn't really expect anything bad or good. All in all, it was better than most movies of it's kind, and could've easily been worse, but could've been just a little bit better too.Of course, it's about a group of young people that, by chance, find their way into the old ruins of some old Mayan pyramid thing. When they get there, they're ambushed by the (Mayan?) locals, and pretty much held at the pyramid/ruins against their will. The locals won't let them leave, and stakeout the outside of the ruins with guns and arrows and all that cool stuff. So, really, what's one to do in such a freaky, crazy situation? There's not much to do other than survive, which is what these people struggle to do throughout the movie. Not only do they have to worry about surviving from hunger or dehydration (five people have only ONE bottle of water to ration, plus a a tiny bit of food), but they also have to worry about not only the crazy ass killer vines/foliage that inhabit these ruins, but they also have to worry about staying sane.Everything that can go wrong pretty much does. The worst things happen to these people. Really. I was watching and every few minutes, I just said, ""Wow, that's a bitch. That sucks."" Not only do they have to worry about freaky killer vines, they also have to worry about themselves, because one of them starts to go insane and one of them is seriously injured.I know what you're thinking. The whole notion of killer plants/vines sounds completely stupid. I thought so, too. How was this going to be scary or even kind of freaky? Personally, I thought they handled it pretty damn well. What could've ended up being ridiculous and stupid ended up being kind of freaky. It's not really the vines/plants themselves that are scary, it's just the idea of what they are and what they do to these people that's kind of scary. The scenes inside the pyramid, where it's just wall to wall of this scary crap, was a little creepy because they were everywhere and it was overwhelming and claustrophobic at the same time. The scenes inside the actual pyramid are scary because it's so dark and it's such a confined space that these vines actually were kind of freaky because they were pretty much wall-to-wall. It was an abyss filled with these plants, that mimicked the noises around them, making them that much more creepy.Of course, the movie's filled with blood. Lots of it. The violence is great because most of it didn't come from the vines like you'd expect; most of the crazy crap was a result of the characters; the presence of the vines just made things worse and nastier. None of the gore is there to really shock you, it's just there, it just makes you cringe instead of yell in excitement, like most movies of it's kind. There's a really nasty scene involving a guy, legs, a hunting knife, a rock, and a hot pan...and it's nasty....The only thing I was missing from the movie was that it didn't really pack much of a punch. It was just there, there wasn't that much to it. A lot of what happens is sad and effective, especially how a lot of these characters get screwed over, but I would've preferred if there was just more to it. I thought it would've been better if the movie was just an all-out downer, even though nothing really positive ever happens. The characters act like you'd expect, too. They go through every decision rationally and logically, and opt not to do things that they know will get them killed. They react just as you'd expect someone to react in a situation like this.It's a cool movie because it doesn't take the easy way out like most horror movies do. Bad things happen to characters that you like, even though you kind of hate to see it, because all these characters are pretty likable and interesting. I thought the ending could've packed more punch, because it ended up being too bland for my taste, but that's just me. Even though some unexpected stuff happens, it still could've used some more punch. But eh. Who cares?This was a pretty cool movie. Could've been a little better, but could've ended up a lot worse, too. Pretty damn entertaining, and some pretty crazy violence. Score: 8"
The Objective             ,dimas777,,horror,2008,5,"The only original idea in this movie is to unapologetically use an actual, on-going and bloody war as a superficial backdrop to a pointless and hackneyed plot. The crew seemed like a good bunch of guys, and I'm sure they had a ton of fun in Morocco filming this. Too bad nobody has done the hard work of coming up with a coherent vision, purpose and narrative; of aligning location, characters and story; of coming up with a meaning or a graceful way of avoiding imposing a meaning; or, at the very least, of making an engaging thriller.Stephanie Martin's cinematography, however, did make the movie much more bearable. Well-done and beautiful. Even stunning at times.The score was quite good as well, I thought."
The Merry Gentleman             ,yousoldmysoulforpogs,,crime,2009,4,"I feel that, even though I really don't want to, I should maybe watch this film again - to maybe see if I missed out any important details or something because from my experience this film has very little to redeem its creation. Frankly, I'd rather the film didn't make any money so that would teach Michael Keaton a lesson. Kelly McDonald's in it - and her character doesn't do any favours to get the audience to empathise or sympathise in any way with her. Likewise, Michael Keaton the retired hit-man love interest out to do one last job is unengaging and wooden. The only portions of the film I enjoyed were most of the scenes involving the fat cop (who fancies Kelly) because he actually manages to act unlike the rest of the cast. In addition, the first twenty minutes of the film where Keaton sneaks about town doing 'hitmanny stuff' is all very well arranged and is admittedly kind of cool - yet this twenty minutes does not in any way reflect the tone nor the level of quality you should expect from the rest of the film following it. I didn't get it"
Frozen River             ,cbutcher318,1,crime,2009,2,"I cannot believe the positive responses to this film. For that matter I can't believe it was accepted into Sundance (for the record I am a big fan of many films that go through Sundance, so this isn't an anti-art film thing). I'm just going to assume that no one actually watched the picture, it was just accepted because of the subject matter or who the Director knows and that she was really nice so they just voted for her film but were too busy to actually watch it. Simply the film is poorly written, poorly directed, and with the exception of the lead actress poorly acted (though I can't really blame them, the writing is awful). I had to hold in the laughter at almost line that was uttered. This was poor formulaic dribble with no heart. I don't buy the whole thing that just because it's about poor people that this must be some powerful film. Unfortunately the film says nothing. You are given no reason to really care for the Protagonists or ever believe that they are in any real danger. I can't go into much detail without making this a spoiler. The point is, don't waste your money, or your time( I wish I could have my time back). This film is miserable. Even more miserable because it is trying to be a work of art. I can understand when a bad studio picture is made, they don't care about soul."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,animation,2008,7,"I am a fan of the first Madagascar film, I know there are a lot of people who dissed it, but I thought it was cute. So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it's not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it's funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it's all good, who knows, maybe Alex's dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They're a blast to watch on screen.7/10"
What Happens in Vegas             ,franchiglen,1,comedy,2008,6,"I am in the majority, with the masses on this one. Many reviews for this movie where truly awful, but I had heard decent reviews from ""normal"" people. Once again, critics have proved the sheer cynicism of their professional title.This movie was very enjoyable on many levels, and I caught myself smiling at numerous scenes. Now that being said, this is in no way a classic romantic comedy. The pros of this movie had to have been the SURPRISINGLY good acting and chemistry displayed by Kutcher and Diaz. However, the bland and generic storyline prevents any special movie blossoming.I use one rule when trying to gauge a particular ""middle of the road"" film like this one. Would I buy it? The acting and humor are good enough for me to watch repeatedly, but the plot is more predictable than a win for the opponent playing against the Detroit Lions. For me, this would not be a buy, but if you have a significant other this would be a thoughtful gift that wouldn't make you suffer at al"
WALL·E             ,likeminded,0,animation,2008,8,"Just got back from a special sneak peek/advance screening of this movie, and I must say, Pixar continues to amaze. They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""least favorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilers or specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitely going to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth every dime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it! 2"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,zmarc,0,animation,2009,4,"I was looking forward to this and expected to like it, but I was crushingly disappointed. I think I could go so far as to say I hated it, which shocks me. How could one go wrong with the story of a funny little mouse who's a hero? I don't know, but somehow this film does it.First of all, the story is way overdone: it's got too many things happening and jumps from plot to plot with no transition at all that it's confusing and breaks your chain of thought. For example, the basic story seems to be that of a brave mouse who saves a princess. But mixed in with that is the story of a rat who's somewhat similar and who helps the mouse. That is further complicated with the story a girl who's a ""princess"" serving as a maid in the King's castle. All of these stories sound generically familiar, but they purposely resolve differently than we expect; I suppose that's to make things more interesting, but I just found it annoying, since the whole movie you are confused as what is happening. Is the Desperaux the mouse the main character? Then why is so much time spent on the rat's story? And which princess are we to root for: both, neither? It's all bewildering.Another fatal flaw is the animation. At times it's breathtakingly beautiful, with fantastic attention to detail. I loved the way Despereaux's nose glistened with faint wetness, for instance. Amazing. But the animation is inconsistent, with humans looking awkward and dorky, and very often the movement of characters defying real-world physics. Like in one scene Despereaux is bouncing on the end of a rope and he bounces as though the rope is elastic -- it just did not feel natural. In many scenes the editing is so choppy and the camera angles so poorly chosen it's difficult to tell what is happening. You get a vague impression and you're probably right, but it's not clear. Another problem is that the film's humor is odd: there are many scenes where the mice discuss Despereaux's problem in that he's not afraid and hasn't ""learned to cower like a proper mouse."" I guess that's supposed to be funny and it is the first time, but it's hammered over and over, with parent-teacher conferences with Despereaux's parents, etc., and in the end it just starts to get repetitive and puzzling. There's also bizarreness associated with the supernatural. While there's an aspect of the film that feels like it should be ""magical"" (fantasy), we're not really shown that anything is actually magic -- except for a strange talking vegetable man. This being assembles itself from a collection of vegetables (i.e. different vegetables for the mouth, nose, eyes, etc.) and he talks. We're given no history of him, no explanation of what he's doing there, how he can talk, what he is, or what happens to him in the end. (Does he die when he fell down the stairs or was he just forgotten on the cutting room floor?) I wanted to see a world with a lot more magic, or key magic used at just the right moment to save the day, or none at all. This bit of random magic for no good reason was just bizarre and weird and pointless.There are a few moments of brilliance: Despereaux himself is very good (though he's not on screen enough), the narration has some good lines, and some of the scenes are interesting. But mostly this is just a mishmash of styles, stories, characters, and confusion. I really disliked it and found myself contemplating leaving the theatre on many occasions (something I've never actually done). Though it's not long, it felt endless. I am extremely disappointed."
35 Shots of Rum             ,tieman64,0,drama,2011,NA,"""35 Shots of Rum"" opens on Lionel, a black African immigrant who spends long hours driving a train across France. Haggard and tired he returns to his tiny apartment, which he shares with daughter Josephine. ""Don't feel I need looking after,"" he tells her, but it's a lie. They're lonesome without each another. Director Claire Denis then lingers on scenes of unusually tender father/daughter intimacy, such that for a while we think the duo may be lovers. But their relationship is more complex; they want to be free of each other but are wary of cutting ties.Denis' films have long focused on France's former colonies (""Chocolat"", ""Beau Travail"", ""White Material"" etc). The political contradictions, psychological pressures and after-effects of this colonial legacy are the targets of ""35 Shots of Rum, but aside from one scene, in which Josephine and her classmates debate colonialism, resistance, globalisation and name-drop philosopher Frantz Fanon and economist Joseph Stiglitz, such ""big issues"" remain in the background. Instead, the film's themes are approached subtly. And so we see first generation immigrants relegated to public sector work, a father and daughter who yearn to move on but feel weighed down by familial, historical and past ties, and characters who are either taxi drivers or train conductors, all things transient, always moving, but going nowhere and unable to move on. A sense of alienation blankets the film, characters trapped in cubicles, cars, carts and carriages, sealed mournfully in the aural cocoons afforded by Ipods, or unable to break free of class and racial straitjackets. Josephine  herself both black-and-white, her mother German - strikes up a relationship with a wealthy French boy called Noe, but their love is an uneasy one. They yearn for one another, but she won't let it happen. Her eyes drift to an African student instead. Gabrielle, another neighbour, likewise mourns the death of her relationship with Lionel. The quartet form the modern family, forever splintered. Meanwhile, no one notices the death of the now unemployed Rene, a co-worker whom Lionel runs over with his train. Rene's representative of a marginalised underclass, discarded and replaced like so much machinery.""Rum"" homages Yasujiro Ozu's ""Late Spring"", a film in which a father urges his daughter to leave his side and pursue marriage. In Denis' hands, the daughter's inability to leave is symbolic of a larger form of both cultural division and shaky assimilation. Beyond this, Denis mimics Ozu's minimalist style, gentle pace and elliptical narrative, but her aesthetic is more sensual, more ethereal, more resemblant of Hou Hsio-hsien (particularly ""Cafe Lumiere""). Denis' train-eye shots also echo Jean Renoir's ""La bete humaine"", but the overt horrors of Renoir's work become a more muted, more accepted form of benign violence in her hands. See the films of Olivier Assayas (particularly ""Summer Hours""), another French director with similar concerns.Though the film is set in France, few of ""Rum's"" characters are white, exemplifying the changes which have rocketed across the European landscape in recent decades. French itself is now spoken mostly by people who aren't French, more than 50 percent of whom are immigrants from Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, and who have settled in France and brought their native cultures with them. What, Denis asks, does French culture signify in a world in which only sixty five million of 200 million French speakers are actually French? Of course culture in general has become increasingly unfixed, unstable, fragmentary and elective. Global capitalism sells distinction and individuality as fast as it destroys the same. In response, groups fight desperately to cling to their roots. In Canada the Quebecers tried outlawing signs and other public expressions in anything but French. Basque separatists have been murdering Spaniards in the name of political, linguistic and cultural independence, just as Franco imprisoned anyone who spoke Basque or Catalan. In Belgium the split between French and Dutch speakers has divided the country for ages. So what Denis captures is a world in which financial, commercial, human, cultural and technology flows are faster and more extensive than ever before, resulting in not only widespread alienation, but a counteractive desire to ""hold fast"" onto what little you have. In France this began in the early 1990s, as debates raged about European integration and the ""benefits of multiculturalism"", which in reality simply meant the freer movements of capital, goods and people. During this period, France's socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, and conservative president Jacques Chirac, often spoke of the need for alternatives to unregulated markets of goods, money, and people and both demanded more ""rules"" to govern globalisation. Their words were smokescreens, however, both rampantly liberalising and privatising large sections of the French economy. It's a common tactic: spout traditionally left-wing discourse on the necessity of ""controlling market forces"", ""combating the excesses of liberalism"" and ""the dangers of unbridled globalisation driven by jungle capitalism"", while doing the opposite. Meanwhile, the dynamics of empire has changed. While globalisation reinstates European and American imperialism by allowing First World capitalists quasi-ownership of Third World countries through purchases of strategic government-owned enterprises, the nature of the French economy has itself changed radically. France has since the early 1980s converted to market liberalisation, both as the necessary by-product of European integration and globalisation and as a result of deliberate efforts by policymakers. People like Sarkozy, Chirac and Jospin have sold off more state-owned assets than the previous five governments put together. Whereas fifteen years ago foreign ownership of French firms was only around 10 percent, today over 40 percent of the shares in France are held abroad, and foreigners own more than half of key French companies. These issues are dealt with overtly in other Claire Denis films. With ""Rum"" she simply presents the fallout. 8.9/10  Near masterpiece. See ""Summer Hours"
Wanted             ,MAShead07,1,action,2008,2,"This film is saturated with absurdity, in an attempt to wow audiences with special effects they have already seen countless times in the likes of Die Hard and Bourne. Nothing new in this film, just a number of Hollywood cliché's, including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person, which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story, and even the Star Wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their father's death, only for the villain to say ""No, I am your father"".The rest of the plot comprises of special effects, absurdity (laughing AT not WITH the film), excessive blood and shooting and swearing and achieves nothing by doing so. James McAvoy totally lets himself down in this role- he was brilliant in ""Last King of Scotland"", but doesn't do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff American accent. His character isn't that believable, and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic, instead of realistic. The rest of the cast, including veteran Morgan Freeman, are paper-thin characters, which also lets them down as actors. As the characters die, it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with them.Although there were some interesting twists in the end, they fail to salvage a film that's only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence, blood and bad language with very little substance. The script is also quite poor, like many modern action films. In my view, this is trying to outdo Goodfellas in violence, bad language and blood, but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility. A further demonstration of unoriginality in Hollywood film-making. 2"
Sex and the City             ,lostatredrock,1,comedy,2008,4,"I took my girlfriend to see this movie last night at the 12:01 showing. She is a huge fan of the show, has every season on DVD, and has seen all the episodes multiple times. I have watched 30-40 episodes I would guess and I would not say that I love the show, but I do find it entertaining and never dreaded my girlfriend pulling out the DVDs to pop them in. So going into it I was there 75% for her and 25% because I genuinely thought it would be an entertaining movie even though it would never make it into my top anything.So with the set-up in place, the movie itself was very disappointing for both my-self and my girlfriend.First looking at the movie in comparison to the show itself, the movie simply felt flat by comparison. The show is full of frank and snappy discussion which manages to come across as both very real and hilarious at the same time. Really the show was built on the interactions of those four girls and those interactions simply fell flat in the movie in a way I never saw them fall flat in the show. Like I said I am only a casual fan of the show and this was apparent to me, it was even more apparent to my girlfriend who is an extreme fan of the show who also found it lacking.Second looking at the movie as a movie independent of the show, this is where the movie really fails. Rather than feeling like a movie which typically has a cohesive plot which spans the breadth of the film with smaller sub-plots which spring up along the way, the movie felt like a series of a TV show in which there is an overarching story arc, but the action is based around the individual episode plots. The latter works in a TV show because episodes by their nature are disjointed, you need to be able to make the individual episode plots stand well on their own or the show will fail. In a movie the result of the latter is very disjointed storyline and plot.Third the ""secrecy"" surrounding this movie really led to big disappointments for both of us. Given all ""secrecy"" one would have assumed that a cursory knowledge of the show and a simple watching of the trailer would not be enough to grasp the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately such an assumption would be wrong. There were a number of plot twists which would have been great were they actually twists, sadly the producers decided that releasing ALL of them in the trailer would make for a better movie, it didn't. The only rational I can see for stupidly releasing such information while you build levels of pretend security is to drive up ticket sales with the reasonable thought: ""if this is what they are showing us in the trailer who knows what will be in the movie!"" Fourth, did the producers decide that strong powerful women would be a threat to the movie going public or something? With the possible exception of Charlotte (although she showed it at times too) these women are all strong, powerful and independent. In the movie Carrie spends the majority of her time first planning her wedding like a giddy school girl and then mopping around for the rest of the movie. Who is this woman because she is not Carrie Bradshaw. Samantha has gone from a strong sexual figure who may have finally found love to someone so whiny and needy you don't recognize her at all. Miranda remains a strong figure but rather than it being portrayed in a good way, it comes across more as her just being a bitch.Fifth some random complaints<U+0085> This movie felt way too much like an ad at way too many points. I know that fashion and all that is supposed to be a part of the story of these women, but was there any need of a 5 minute Mercedes-Bens ad aka ""Fashion Week"" right smack in the middle of the movie? What the hell happened to Stamford? The banter between he and Carrie is one of my favorite parts of the show I don't know that he said more than two words to her the entire movie.Why was Charlotte even in the movie? It felt like they made it most of the way through filming and then realized they had forgotten all about her so they threw her in got her pregnant and hoped no one would notice she really didn't have much of a part since a pregnancy is so big for her. It might have worked to only as I said above as something that might have constituted a surprise to the movie going public is had to be disclosed in the trailer.On the subject of characters who really served no purpose why was Jennifer Hudson in this movie? She was amazing in Dreamgirls so I don't blame her for the one dimensional token character, but somebody deserves some blame. I can only guess that she was there in response to criticism of the series as being too white, but is the best response to such criticism really inserting a character who is so obviously a token it's painful? Again on the subject of pointless and forgettable characters, I know this movie should be primarily about the female leads, but that does not mean that all the male characters should be so flat that cardboard cutouts would perform just as well in their place. 1"
I Sell the Dead             ,donalscallan,,misc,2011,1,This film is a poor attempt at comedy and horror. It has mild frights and even milder humor.The movie drags on for far too long and really is not very well cast.The most annoying thing about this tripe is the accents that some of the actors attempt to put on. Especially Monaghans character as a kid. The majority of Irish accents are laughable apart from the odd actual Irish person who got a role in the movie(you can spot the real accents very easily).Some scenes look like they where thrown together after the movie was finished to fill in the time.Please save yourself a few quid and rent/buy something els
Frost/Nixon             ,classicalsteve,0,misc,2009,10,"The relevance of this film today may be sadly overlooked. As the current President of the United States (George W. Bush) ends his tenure with his country disillusioned, in debt, at war, and in disarray, one cannot help but compare him to the late Richard Nixon. Strangely, the older politician, now dead and buried for over a decade, seems much more the intellectual statesman. Nixon has always seemed the darker man, the loner in the Oval Office, as compared to Bush, the happy-go-lucky Texan. While the former suffered from the same malady of self-importance, at least he would ponder positive foreign affairs decisions before creating his political enemy's list. The latter would rather snap celebrity photos with endearing fans than answer tough questions about foreign policy. Leave that to Cheney. Both Nixon and Bush seemed to suffer from the same kind of self-aggrandizement that put the country and the world at tremendous risk. One lost the presidency for his flaws, the other lost nothing personally, except the well-being and respect of his nation.Frost/Nixon, filmed in semi-documentary style by Ron Howard, is about the elder statesman Nixon revealing himself and his enigmatic heart of hearts to his country and the world via a relatively lightweight British interviewer, David Frost. Overnight, Frost has to remake himself from a chatty interviewer like Jay Leno into a tough interrogator like Mike Wallace. Both men have a lot at stake. According to the film, Frost's career has stagnated and he desperately needs a large breakthrough in media to be taken seriously. And he has shoved most of his personal capital into the project. Nixon was never tried for Watergate and therefore never had a platform from which his case was heard. The Frost interviews becomes Nixon's witness stand, and the television his courtroom.The acting in this film is some of the finest of all the Oscar contenders of 2008, probably because Sheen and Langella re-prised their roles from the Broadway and London stage-play of the same name. For well over 30 years, Frank Langella has been quietly forging an acting career that has had sparse recognition for the quality of his work. In short, he is one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated talents in Hollywood films, until now. This film has allowed Langella's acting range and versatility to glow into THE performance of 2008. Langella literally becomes Nixon, shaping his subtle mannerisms and guttural tone. And yet, Langella does even one better. He somehow shapes Nixon's attitudes as if he understood who Nixon was on the inside as well as the outside. Good actors can mimic facial expressions. It takes a superb acting of uncommon ability to portray the inner qualities of his/her subject. Langella brings forth the inner Nixon in the same way that the real David Frost did 30 years ago.Equally superb is the portrayal of David Frost by Michael Sheen. Similar to Langella, Sheen also brings forth the inner Frost, the sort of sexy rock star interviewer who must turn into something he has never been: a tough journalist probing the inner meat of his interviewee. The film very slowly shows us the transition of Frost into the kind of journalist he had to become in order to face Richard Nixon. No American president is easily knocked down and left bare by the likes of a journalist, and Nixon was no exception. Frost had to have an arsenal of not just tough questions but tough responses if he was going to be able to bring out the inner soul of Nixon. Frost had to discard the chatty sensibility of a Jay Leno or David Letterman and transform himself into the passionate journalist of a Mike Wallace or Christiane Amanpour. A superb film and relevant to the current state of American politics. Nixon had to come clean and Frost was both his judge and his confessor, partially because the former president had resigned. The current president (as of 1/07/09), despite eight years of abuse of power, leaves the office without the stain of impeachment. He will probably never have to answer to a David Frost or a Mike Wallace. What a pity"
Shutter             ,movedout,0,horror,2008,3,"Take it as it is. A derivative, leaden, mind-numbingly simplified remake of a superior original. That's not to say that it's genuinely decent on its own merits if you've not already seen 2004's seminal Thai-horror ""Shutter"" that reignited that country's interest in producing slow burning, luxuriously made horror films. Interestingly, and perhaps even fittingly, the Hollywood machine that devours and regurgitates the recent slate of J-Horror films has turned its sights on ""Shutter"", which arguably finds its core roots in Japan's horror conventions in its vengeful, waifish ghost girl tormenting the living by manifesting through various electronic mediums. So what Masayuki Ochiai's adaptation essentially becomes is a carbon copy of copy.American photographer Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his blonde schoolteacher bride Jane (Rachael Taylor) go straight from nuptials to a working honeymoon in Japan, natch, because America just isn't as scary to Americans as Asia is. Before heading off to Ben's lucrative assignment in Tokyo, the newly minted couple heads to a remote countryside inn when a brief accident derails Jane's constitution and compels her to seek out answers led by a phantasmal presence in photographs and a newly discovered knowledge of spirit photography.Unremarkably, Luke Dawson's screenplay omits and appends details to its basic premise. The original uses the stark disassociation of city living to intensify the eeriness of isolation, and the idea that we never really see what we think we know. Dawson's script transplants the couple to a different country, ramping up the cultural alienation and exoticism of another culture. It's not dissimilar to what we've already seen in ""The Grudge"" remakes.Even as Ochiai's direction is comparatively surefooted and patient with the camera choosing to hang on to a scene instead of ludicrously harping on jump-cuts and eyeball-rattling shots that bounce off the wall, the film feels unambitiously stale. ""Shutter"" goes through the motions of dourly checking off look-behind-you set pieces and reflections on windows. The plotting and performances are so apparent; you'd find yourself a couple of steps ahead of the film's central faux-mystery. While the bizarre symbiotic relationship audiences have with particularly mediocre remakes of Asian horror films should still live on after this, what remains most terrifying is how textbook simple and undemanding the film-making has become for films of its ilk."
"Surfer, Dude             ",stodruza,0,comedy,2008,8,"I like films like this more and more.Not much to say, this film won't stress you out, won't make to many demands on you, like a surfer girlfriend, and you don't have to even pay that much attention.The goats, you gotta enjoy the goats. You didn't enjoy the goats? I don't know what lest to say, like the movie itself.Mellow out, enjoy life and enjoy this flick. A rumpas through the sun with McConaghey as the leader of the tribe.Could have had more surfing. Music was alright. I liked it.This film works because it is a blueprint for a life that definitely has its appeal. Be Your own man, surf, get the girls, be true to yourself, enjoy life, be one with nature."
A Christmas Tale             ,WilliamCKH,1,comedy,2008,9,"I can't say I'm a huge fan of Arnaud Despleshin's films, but of all the ones I've seen, this is my favorite. The first few scenes of the movie, with its flashbacks and quick cuts seem disjointed at first, but it does really quickly pull you into the family situation. And when the family does finally arrive altogether at the Vuillard house, you almost feel as if you're one of the guests. All the actors are wonderful, but I must say that Amalric, who almost always plays this type of character in Despleshin films (Kings and Queen, My Sex Life, etc.) is terrific in this film. He's much more likable here. And Emmanuelle Devos has such presence in this movie that she steals pretty much every scene she's in. The rest of the cast, Deneuve, Rousillion and Cosigny are all terrific.I love how the script deals with so many subjects, not only of the family history and Junon's need for a donor, but also touches on everything from mathematics to philosophy to literature, to all types of music, religion, and all geared towards how all these things enhance, and does not consume, the life of the family. It was very refreshing to see this family, although messed up in so many ways, to live free of convention, children curse, everyone's smoking and/or drinking, telling each other what they really feel and think and/or not feel and think. I also liked that the house felt like a house that people actually lived in."
Good Dick             ,screamingfoot,1,misc,2009,8,"I just finished watching this and I thought it was very good. I watch at least one movie every day and I have to say, this film was very good but not perfect. I'd attribute the 1/10 votes on IMDb to haters only. Almost no film deserves a 1/10 and unfortunately fans will vote 10/10 to counter the bullsh!t 1/10 hater votes.As for the story, of all the 6 Billion people living on Earth, I think it's quite possible that there are characters and situations such as those depicted in this film. Sorry to those who think it was unrealistic, but I do believe you've been conditioned to expect only certain hackneyed situations and characters in movies. I'd take THIS kind of film/story over the cliché bullsh!t of ""guys with guns"" that neophyte filmmakers seem intent on propagating. It was hard to watch at times but it was worth it. Great soundtrack. Great leads. Great casting. Great writing. Great direction.I was a little confused by the casting of Tom Arnold. I'm not sure, since his role was so small, what good it does to cast a known celebrity in a film full of unknowns. He kind of stands out like a sore thumb at a time in the story where you really shouldn't be distracting from the storyline.I'll be looking for more films from this director."
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,billa2,1,adventure,2008,1,"Absolutely awful, maybe the only people who would find this funny are head trauma patients who are 3rd time lobotomy volunteers and are drunk. But to be fair on a scale, this movie has no character development, horrible jumpy story with no true plot. Very awful unfunny dialog that is in many ways irrelevant to the plot. So there is your fair break down of this movies suckiness.The writers will destroy all the movies you love and incidentally all the movies they themselves are incapable of writing.I hope all evidence of this movies existence is burned and shot into space in the name of good taste.

The Escapist             ,kinger1974,,crime,2011,1,"This film uses the tired old trick of flashing back to try and keep us thrilled. It is used as a substitute for a decent plot. There is no depth to any of the characters other than the lead.I'm also confused as to why someone would cast pigeon-chested effeminate guy as top-dog in a prison. Or how we are supposed to believe someone is able to manufacture Class A drugs in prison from an orange an a fruit-cake. Yes, I know we are supposed to suspend our disbelief, but I think the director could have met us half way. Of course, they do put in the rape scene, which seems to be obligatory in every film set in prison now. Yawn.When you get to the final twist in the wafer thin plot, you realise you've just wasted another 102 mins of your life. Perhaps a few more if your daft enough to post about on a website."
Kung Fu Panda             ,abecipriano,0,animation,2008,10,"From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of ""The Matrix"" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Beauty & The Beast."" Has the makings of being a classic.My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!Enjoy! 1"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,DrEbert,0,action,2008,6,"Usually, when you go to see an action/adventure movie, especially an Indiana Jones movie, you're going to suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to ""get into"" the movie. These kinds of movies are supposed to be mindless escapist fun. Still, one might expect some small modicum of plausibility or connection to the real world. When it comes to ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" forget about suspending disbelief. Just pretend you're in another dimension altogether. If you do that, you'll have have met one of the two prerequisites for seeing this movie. (If you don't believe me now, you will when you see this film and see our hero survive a cataclysmic event in a fairly cartoonish manner a mere 15 minutes into the film.) The other prerequisite is that you've seen the other three movies...religiously. A huge chunk of the entertainment value of this film comes from nostalgia, in-jokes, and self-parody. It is an entertaining movie and I had fun and laughed while I was watching it and the reason for this is because we are either enjoying seeing all of the same old gags done once again in a bigger and cooler way, or we are enjoying seeing those gags mocked. Trusty bullwhip? Check. Fedora? Check. Long car chase with fighting and leaping and what-not? Check. Dark tombs lit only by torches? Check. Gross creepy crawly critters? Check.This is what makes the movie entertaining, but is also what prevents it from greatness and what makes me hesitant to call it a true ""Indiana Jones"" movie. George Lucas (who co-wrote the screenplay) has tried to do here what he did to the ""Star Wars"" prequels, namely that he thinks that appealing to the fan base with in-jokes, self-parody, and re-hashing the same old stuff can take the place of actually writing a a story that can stand on its own merits. The ""Star Wars"" prequels failed because Lucas could not get past his constant references to the original trilogy and so instead created fan fiction instead of true prequels. (Well, there was also the fact that Lucas' dialogue SUCKED.) Here, the stunts and action sequences and in-jokes keep us feeling entertained during the course of the film, but when we walk away, we wonder where was the real story.Indiana Jones is a homage to 1930s serials about treasure hunters. He's out of place in the 1950s. Also out of place are the Soviets(led by Cate Blanchett in a Rosa Kleb-like role). And there are many, many, MANY instances where you will get to wondering just how implausible the next stunt will be. All of that I can put up with, though, and in fact can and do add to the entertainment value of the film. What I could not put up with was the ending, which will remind you not of Indiana Jones but of the ending to another Spielberg movies that pre-dates ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" This movie is lots of fun to watch, but it doesn't take itself seriously and probably shouldn't be part of the Indiana Jones canon. 744"
The Bank Job             ,Grant_Price,0,crime,2008,2,"What truly worthwhile aspects can be taken from a film like The Bank Job? Well, 'Mutton Dagger' for a start. Including that is nothing short of immature genius. Lots and lots of breasts is another. Expert alliteration using the world renowned C word is also significant. Aside from that though, there isn't much, leaving The Bank Job a vacuous and unpleasant experience. Anybody expecting another Lock, Stock or Snatch (as the marketing suggests) will be severely disappointed. Sure, director Roger Donaldson attempts to weave an intricate tapestry of lies, double crosses, witty dialogue and interrelated characters who all conveniently find themselves present at the less than satisfying climax, but he utterly fails. So many poorly executed sub-plots and underdeveloped characters are crammed into the running time that there isn't actually any room for anything else. Like interest. Or continuity. Or drama.The tepid story is based on an actual 1970s bank robbery which took place in London by a team of small time criminals. Amongst the safety deposit boxes in the bank's vault are a number of photographs depicting a member of the royal family in various promiscuous positions and a ledger containing the names of all the corrupt police officers in the city. Various interest groups do not want these items to fall in the wrong hands and so, with little imagination, try to retrieve them from the group of robbers. That's it. That's the whole story. It's VERY difficult to guess the outcome, like whether the cheeky criminals lead by wide boy Jason Statham will get away with it and live happily ever after or if the compromising ledger will fall into the hands of the only honest policeman in Scotland Yard, but I believe anybody not in a persistent vegetative state could probably work it out. A little more problematic though, is how everything actually all works out. The screenwriters noticed this during filming and helpfully included a couple of lines of dialogue in order to resolve any ambiguity which, to paraphrase, went like this: Bank robber: ""How did we get away with not getting arrested by the police for stealing millions of pounds, when they CLEARLY knew it was us, even if we did give them the ledger?"" Jason Statham: ""I don't know."" Excellent. No perplexity here. There is also a side story involving Black civil rights revolutionary Michael X (NOT Malcolm) which seems like it was shoehorned into the film during post production when somebody suddenly realised that the entire cast was white. It is difficult to recall anything about the cast, which consists mostly of cardboard cut-outs with voice-overs. There were policemen, whom you could tell were policemen because they arrived in twos, stood with their hands in the pockets of their flowing black coats and spoke as though they were doing somebody a favour every time they opened their mouths. The antagonists were easy to discern because they looked menacing and used four word sentences which were almost always dripping with malice/stupidity. Finally the good guys were the ones standing around Jason Statham whenever he was in a scene, unless it was a scene in which he was being menaced by the bad guys. It took really solid acting all round to convey this. It would have been mightily confusing otherwise.See this film either if you don't like money and like to rid yourself of it in the most boring ways you can think of or if you find it amusing to observe Jason Statham struggling through yet another miscast role: JS: Do I need to look angry or confused here? Director: Well, she's your daughter and you're giving her a present. JS: So...angry then? D: No, I'm kind of looking for loving and happy. JS (pulling a face): You mean like this? D: Well...that's more like confusion, don't you think? JS: I...can't tell."

Untraceable             ,JoeKarlosi,1,crime,2008,7,"Entertaining thriller about a crazed young computer geek who becomes the deranged moderator of his own ""Kill With Me"" live internet feed where he displays new victims being slowly tortured to death. The more hits he gets at his site, the faster the people featured on his webcam die. This is disturbing in making us realize what depths we've sunk to in our society, and what morbid curiosities can do. I especially liked that the 40-something Diane Lane is the star as the police woman who tries to apprehend the killer, instead of relying on the usual Jessica Alba or Sarah Michelle Gellar ""honeys"" of late. *** out of **** "
Lakeview Terrace             ,npatel-8,0,crime,2008,4,"Honestly, I never watch movies about racism other than those I was forced to watch (even read about) in high school. Fortunately, college doesn't focus on this. I've seen quite a few of the more conventional ""whites are racist"" versions and they are all better than this.I had no idea what the movie was about. I thought it was a thriller with a misjudged cop living next door. Wrong! The entire first half is slow...very slow. They slowly show you the personalities of everyone and then the movie starts.By the end of the movie, I was very mad. I knew the cop was racist but I didn't realize the whole dang movie was about this. I thought there would be a better motive than the one that was given. They try to explain how he became like this and it still wasn't enough.I should have read the synopsis first...and I would have passed on this movie. Unfortunately I didn't and this movie gets anther negative review."
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,Jinjuraly,,animation,2008,NA,"Pirates was very cute, i took all of my younger brothers and sisters to see it and each of them liked something different about the movie. I especially liked the part where the rowboat fell out of the sky and the Rock Monster song was very funny. I grew up watching Veggie Tales and have been very disappointed with their more recent videos (post 2003 era) mostly because the writing seems to have lost something, it seemed like they were forcing the stories to have a blatantly Christian message. This movie was different from any other veggie tales because there was no Bible story the Pirates story was better than anything that's come out from them recently. However, about halfway through watching it, I started to fidget, luckily I had a bag with yarn and a crochet hook and I ended up having half a scarf by the time the movie was ove"
The Reader             ,catmmo,1,drama,2009,9,"I read the book this movie is based on about 10 years ago, and as I watched the movie, it came back to me. I am not a Nazi sympathizer - very much NOT so - but at one point during the trials when Kate Winslet's character (Hanna) asks the judge, ""what would you have done"" kind of sums it up a lot. By reading the book beforehand, there is a lot more insight that perhaps the movie doesn't clearly give. From the beginning in the book it seems obvious that Hanna is illiterate and so later she on more apparent that she could never have possibly written the reports she was accused of. Why she allowed it to happen that she got put in prison, one does not really know. Was it to help with the guilt she felt for what she knew she had done even if she did not write the reports? Whether this story is really true or not, it's an interesting look on the other side to the Holocaust. Hitler did not just enact a huge amount of genocide, he also brainwashed even his own to a certain *ideal* and it was an obey or be killed. Orwell's 1984 is a fantasized yet so true of this way of thinking. Please read the literature and books and everything you can find on the Holocaust. The brilliant minds we lost during that time will never be recovered."
The Ruins             ,flyroundee,,adventure,2008,8,"I wasn't expecting too much going to see this, but knowing that it was an adaptation from a novel I figured it had to be a decent story at least. I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely wasn't your average 'horror' film, if you want recycled bullshit go see the travesty that is Prom Night. This is different. It literally got under my skin at a few parts and made me squirm, and that pretty tough to do to me. The story resembled a Stephen King-esquire short story. It was grim, unpleasant, and gory. It didn't use conventional scare tactics (which are so overdone these days) but used a tone of dread and hopelessness to get to the viewer. Check it out if your looking for that type of film, cheers 1"
The Incredible Hulk             ,Critomaton,0,action,2008,1,"Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat.Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's ""failure"". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film."
Changeling             ,john_seater,1,misc,2008,10,"When my wife and I first heard that another Eastwood film was coming out, we planned to see it. Then we read unremitting negative comments by the critics, so we hesitated. We decided to see the film anyway because we have liked everything Eastwood has directed, and we knew that some of the cast were fine actors. Wow, are we glad we stuck with our first instinct. The film is excellent.The critics panned the script, by J. Michael Straczynski. One critic mentioned that Straz wrote Babylon 5 and suggested that was reason enough to expect this script to be bad. In fact, Babylon 5 was very good, and so is the script for this movie. Critics complained about Eastwood's directing, but the directing was fine. Some of the critics complained about the acting, but in fact the acting is flawless. My general impression of critics has been strongly reinforced: they typically are shallow and self-important windbags trying to show off how smart and sophisticated they are. They should be ignored.The story itself is sad, uplifting, disturbing, and bittersweet all at the same time. It is, sad to say, a true story.The characters come across as real people, as is typical for Eastwood's films. Every single actor delivers exactly the right performance for the role being played. Indeed, the acting is the best part of this movie, though I do not mean to diminish any other aspect of the film by saying that. There are several children in the film who have significant parts, often with lines that must convey genuine emotions of fear or remorse. Not easy stuff for a kid to get right, yet all of them do their jobs very well. That is partly a tribute to Eastwood's directing, showing his ability to elicit strong performances from his actors.There is no point listing every actor here and praising their performances one by one. They were all outstanding. I will single out Angelina Jolie for special mention, though. She is the main character, and her performance is simply superb. Her range of emotions is truly remarkable. What a fine actress she is"
Gran Torino             ,machngunjoe,0,drama,2009,5,"Despite all the rave reviews, which I don't understand, I didn't think this movie was made very well. It was mainly the acting and the writing. CLint Eastwoods performance was great, but everybody else was bad. From the Young preacher to the main Hmong characters the acting was forced and you could tell that all these people had never done a movie before, which according to IMDb is mostly true.Right off the bat you saw the actor who played the preacher was of considerably less caliber than anyone else in the scenes. The Hmong actor during a climatic scene with Clint Eastwood seemed fake, forced and just not very good. Again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor, so it was quite noticeable.The writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.I know Clint Eastwoods movies are plain movies, usually low budget, with fresh new actors, and simple plot lines, with the exception of his latest WWII movies and Mystic River. Although the revenue must be very high for this movie cause I'm sure it was dirt cheap to make considering all the aspects, but this certainly isn't a must see even if it is his last acting movie."
Trucker             ,MBunge,1,drama,2012,NA,"Trucker is a very, very good film that's only let down in the end by its pitiful lack of plot. Sterling performances, believable human relationships and an engrossing look at the lower rungs of the American success ladder grab your interest and make you care about what happens in this story. Then with its conclusion, it's as if writer/director James Mottern decided to go out of his way to remind the audience that there was really no structure or direction or design to anything they just watched. Now, you don't have to have a great plot to have a great movie. Michelle Monaghan and Nathan Fillion are so wonderfully relaxed and human here that more of plot might have only gotten in the way. What you cannot do, however, with a motion picture that's all about experiencing the emotion of human struggle and the slap on a finish that's dependent on unsupported, arbitrary and ridiculous-in-the-light-of-day conflicts.Diane Ford (Michelle Monaghan) is a truck driver, cruising through a life of casual isolation from the world and alienation from herself. Her existence is made up of long hauls, random one night stands and then returning home to adolescently flirt with a married man (Nathan Fillion), but she doesn't seem all that unhappy with it. Then the son she abandoned 10 years ago (Jimmy Bennett) is dropped on her doorstep because his father (Benjamin Bratt) is dying of cancer and Diane's life has to get a lot less casual.You may have heard of Monaghan's performance here and it is every bit as good as people say. She beautifully inhabits Diane Ford. From her sexual ease to her inability to refer to her 11 year old son with something other than ""dude"" to her growing awareness that contentment in being alone is breaking down, this is some award worthy acting. Nathan Fillion is just as good as a man so enthralled with Diane that he can't imagine life without her, even though he's not actually with her. Benjamin Bratt is also powerful in the small but crucial role of the father and Jimmy Bennett as the boy<U+0085>well, he's not one of these freakish child actors who blow you away on screen, but that's probably good for him and the talent he does have is good enough.And the awkward, difficult and ultimately rewarding relationships between these people carry Trucker along on a cloud of goodwill. You like these people, even when they're not trying to be likable, and that can take things a long way. These are the kind of characters where you actively want them to have a happy ending.What makes a very good film like this great are the obstacles put in the way of that happy ending and that's where Trucker breaks down on the side of the road. There are two interrelated issues that come to a head at the end of this story. Will Diane and her son stay together? Will Diane exchange her selfish and deleterious independence for some sense of belonging? With the first, there's never any question at all. I know there's supposed to be a suspension of disbelief, but you've got to be a massively credulous moron to think for a nanosecond that her son might wind up anywhere but with Diane. Monaghan and Bennett do everything they can to create and sustain some doubt, but Writer/director Mottern's plot doesn't do anything to establish and build up any possible alternative to Diane and her son staying together. There's only one other potential destination and Mottern does nothing to make it seem even vaguely credible.With the second, it's first dealt with when Diane and her married ""friend"" finally acknowledge their love for each other. But first we're told they've been doing this dance for 4 years. Now, Diane's independence explains why they're not married or together in some other way. But why haven't they boinked in 4 years when from their first moment we see them together they're practically drooling over each other? Again, the plot doesn't do the work to justify their chastity. And then there's the big moment at the end where Diane is confronted with the consequences of her aimless and self-centered ways. Well, aside from not matching the tone and feel of the rest of Trucker, that big moment turns on a character who hasn't been heard from or seen on screen for over an hour doing something that not only make no sense in general, it doesn't fit anything previously set up about the character or his agenda. When the big moment happened, I wasn't even sure it was the same character at first because his reappearance and actions are so out of the blue. Again, if that's how things were going to conclude, the plot needed to do a lot more work foreshadowing or at least rationalizing it.With a plot that competently introduced, sustained and exacerbating a series of conflicts to lead to a satisfying ending, Trucker would have been a great motion picture. Without one, this is still very, very good and more than worth your time and trouble. Give it a loo"
The Women             ,choua_lo,1,comedy,2008,1,"I really wish I had read everyone's review before going to see the movie... it was one of the most excruciating films that I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie; I should have followed my instinct. The movie offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very cliché. I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! The characters did not represent any women that I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, poor make-up and hair styling. It was recently compared to the Sex and in the City movie; it was not even half as good. My suggestion, do not see this movie! "
Death Race             ,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,0,action,2008,8,"Definitely better than the ridiculous ""Righteous Kill"", that we had the doubtful honor to view today also, at the same press screening, here in Bucharest, Romania.""Death Race"" is a honest to God action movie, without any bigger-than-life pretensions. The script follows correctly an old tested and tried recipe, everything is at its place, and although you can easily plot out the whole course since the beginning, somewhat even this sounds good - you simply have the guilty pleasure of savoring again a story that you know from dozens of other movies.The influences from the racing video games are explicit, and well mastered - me, I fully felt as while playing ""Death Rally"". Even certain aerial shots are obvious quotes from the computer game imagery. The narrative is nervous and thrilling, the effects professional, the violence degree precisely balanced. Maybe the main virtue of the movie is the cinematography, with admirable chromatic and plastic values. All in all, what it promises, it delivers: a cheap show, well done. "
The Brothers Bloom             ,Gordon-11,1,action,2009,NA,"This film is about two brothers executing the ultimate scheme to con a rich attractive woman.I never thought a Rachel Weisz movie could be dull and senseless as this, but ""The Brothers Bloom"" really takes that trophy. The plot is dull, and it fails to engage me at all. The pacing is so slow, that I felt so bored after the first twenty minutes. They could have at least cut fifteen minutes of that and not affected the story. It's just far too long, with so many uninteresting and unimportant scenes in between the useful scenes. I feel so sorry for Rinko Kikuchi's character, as she is delegated to a replaceable prop, which actually could be deleted entirely without affecting the story.As a con movie it is too slow and winding, as a romantic comedy it lacks the uplifting factor. In short, ""The Brothers Bloom"" is a dull mess."
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,chrichtonsworld,1,adventure,2008,6,"This movie has a lower rating than ""Superhero movie"". And that was absolutely crap. I am not a child and not a dog lover. Still i found myself liking this movie.And no I am not suffering from any mental illness or something like that. Honestly the nerve of people to say something like that. I wonder if most of the reviewers actually have seen the movie. If so what did these people expect from a movie like this. A talking Chihuahua reciting a poem from Shakespeare or just a cute dog mixed up in some little adventure. Compared to previous Disney movies about animals it is on the same level. So what if it isn't original. What movie is these days. This movie hasn't got one dull moment. I sat through the movie without ever looking at the clock. And I can tell you that a lot of the big titles that came out this year wished they had the same effect on me.Most of the box office titles made this year have disappointed me much more because I had high expectations. For ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" i had no expectations whatsoever and got rewarded with fun."
Pride and Glory             ,kircherfamily,,crime,2008,10,"This movie was great. A good performance by Colin Farell and even better by Edward Norton. Don't listen to any of the negative comments about this movie they are not true at all. The movie has you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire thing. Edward Norton proves again why he is the best actor today, and how he carefully chooses what movies to star in. The movie had some violence and dropped a lot of f-bombs, but if you are a Ed Norton fan and want to see a good movie, here is the one. The movie has a good ending, and kept me interested. There were also solid performances from Noah Emmerich and Jon Voight. Overall, I loved this movie and was one of the best I have seen this year"
Nim's Island             ,cnet,1,adventure,2008,9,"I had no idea what to expect of this film, and after reading the synopsis I wasn't to jazzed to see it. But I like both Jodie Foster and Gerald Butler, and the kids were bored so off to the movies we go.I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. The movie was a great escape. It had humor, adventure, sharks, flying lizards, volcanoes, hurricanes, neurotic shrews, phantom heroes, and British tourists. All the makings of a classic family movie.The film, for those unfamiliar with the book, revolves around Nim and her Father and the secret island the live on. When Nim's father goes missing while doing research, she reaches out to the neurotic, reclusive, and ""borderline Agoraphobic"" Alexandria Rover for help.Comedy, fun, and adventure ensue.One of the best parts of this movie was how it encouraged both reading and using one's imagination.My kids (both girls, ages six and nine) enjoyed it and my wife and I also thought it was just great.Update 4/11/2008 - My oldest daughter is about halfway through the book and reports that the movie stays very true to the book for the most part."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,elvinjones,0,misc,2008,9,"il divo is the greatest Italian movie from so many years and better then the works by elio petri, that have made in the past movies with political characters like ""todo modo"" in this movie characters are not only hyper-described in a grotesque way but there's a great work of acting by the actors that made this movie not only a blasting pamphlet Giulio Andreotti is the main character (and i have no words to describe the greatness of our contemporary major actor, toni servillo) but is a ferocious tale about power not against one person. Truly Andreotti (described in the decline years) was the quintessential symbol of power in Italy, the way to made politics following the hypocrite way of evil to do the good. Now things are changed and not in best. The greatness of sorrentino is that he doesn't choose the realistic style of the denounce movie. All is grotesque, over-style, but is necessary to show the real face of my country. Be artificial to tell the essence of Truth. All the actors are in state of grace Servillo over all and Sorrentino direct the movie thinking over the poverty and the childish indulgence of our cinema. The country of disgusting Muccino and Moccia have a real talented genius finally!!!! welcome this healthy movie. I'm proud"
Summer Hours             ,gradyharp,1,drama,2009,8,"SUMMER HOURS (L'heure d'été) is more of a reverie than a story for a film. This very French film touches the subject of family - the meaning and influence and contradictions - in an examination of coping with the death of the matriarch and her wishes versus the intentions of the siblings. Writer/Director Olivier Assayas seems less interested in allowing the viewer to get to know the individuals of the story than he is with conveying the vacuum of death and the aftermath of dealing with it in the setting of a family of grown children. The film opens as it closes - in summer with scenes awash with French countryside living. Three children have gathered with their families for the 75th birthday of their mother, the elegant and wistful Hélène (Edith Scob) whose adoration of her famous painter uncle presses on her mind as she senses her own mortality. One son, Frédéric (Charles Berling) is her confidant in hearing her wishes about the dispersal of the house and furniture and art that mean so much to her. Her other son Jérémie (Jérémie Renier) has traveled from his new home in China where his tennis shoes company has stationed him: his fondness for his mother is apparent but his need for financing makes him view the wishes of his mother in a more practical light. Her daughter Adrienne (Juliet Binoche) has traveled from her preferred new home in New York City and views the wishes of her mother with a similar practical and somewhat distant stance. Some time later the mother dies and the children gather for the funeral and for the discussion of what to do with the 'inheritance'. The interplay between the sentimental Frédéric and the pragmatic Adrienne and Jérémie bring about questions of placing the art and furniture with museums and the selling of the house of their youth. Gentle undertones of sibling relationships and questions about the quality of memorabilia versus the practicality of getting on with living provide the final movement. The film ends in a coda that returns the younger generation (Hélène's grandchildren) to the beauty of the gardens of the now empty French house. The thread that holds the film together is the presence of the longtime housekeeper Éloïse (Isabelle Sadoyan), the gentle being that understands it all. Though the film is beautifully acted and photographed there is very little development of the various characters, a fact that leaves the viewer with the feeling of simply peeking through a windowpane to watch a French family walk through a moment in life and in death. Nothing much happens here: the film is more a reverie, but a very beautiful one to relax and enjoy. Grady Harp"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,The-Kissable-Writer,0,drama,2009,7,"How many percent of the earth is populated by writers? And does the same ratio count for the figments of imagination that inhabit our little screen? How many writers use their work to conquer their demons, usually to get rid of the grenade fragments left over from growing up in a dysfunctional family? Michael Waechter just finished his latest novel; serious literature. A merciless word storm, written in pure gall, a not to be misunderstood way of slaying his demon namely his terror-prone father. Previously only occupying himself with sugar sweet love tales, this indicates a radical change in Michael's authorial style as well as in his way of dealing with his troubled existence. This is where the characters' journeys start, for our protagonist it's a search for a way of forgiving his father, his path is ridden with the verbalizing of a ton of words unsaid too long and energetic arguments, as the audience gets sucked in further and further the - in the beginning only skin-deep - dramatic tension mounts. The picture uses it's runtime skilfully, the development of the 'original' characters occupies nearly all scenes, once in a while the director permits us a small pause to catch our breath and reflect upon what just went on. The new generation (children Christopher and Leslie) clearly are being presented to us as a reincarnation of Michael and his young ante Jane, of who it's fair to say they grew up close enough to almost be brother and sister - the unmistakable physical resemblance alone says enough. The only significant difference is the nature of fathers, they have the luck of having a loving, gentler father who unfortunately is away a lot on business, where as Michael's father is the hard, domineering type, the kind of father who maybe loves his family a little too much to be healthy for him, or his family for that matter.Herein eventually lies the human quality of the character and the redemption. Hereby we can wholeheartedly accept - even though it appeared not to be true for a very long time - Michael forgiving his father, which culminates in a catharsis-classic: the burning of his newborn baby book in the fireplace, and we can even rejoice in Michael regaining personal freedom.Now, for those who are not convinced the father deserves being forgiven, that's not really the core of it all. The point is this: even deeply rooted hate, however justified, has to be overcome in order to be happy. Hate is so powerful it can and will easily consume the one who holds the grudge and it often destroy families. In my opinion the whole film is centered around Christopher, in order to save the child's still pure soul, Michael is forced to take that last, hard step towards full maturity.A simple movie? Maybe. Simplistic? Absolutely not. Above everything else, this movie is oh so full of truth and genuine emotion."
Goodbye Solo             ,john-zeigler,0,drama,2008,10,"I saw CHOP SHOP at the film forum and loved it, so when a friend told me to go see GOODBYE SOLO, I took the recommendation. SOLO was different from what I expected. It was a lot funnier than CHOP SHOP. I laughed so hard, especially in the beginning. Toward the end, things start to get a lot more emotional. It's a life-affirming film with such a subtly of power that it's haunting. Once the film was over and everything sunk in, it stayed with me, even after leaving the theater and into the night. This is proof enough that Ramin Bahrani has made something original and vital. Like in CHOP SHOP, you can feel the soul of these characters. I can't wait to see what he will be working on next. I hope these actors go up for huge awards or make great careers for themselves, and I hope that Bahrani keeps making movies as good and as sublime as this one."
Gran Torino             ,isabelle1955,0,drama,2009,NA,"Gran Torino is a rather one dimensional vehicle for Clint Eastwood, who has been one of my favorite actors since Rawhide. I freely admit I was disappointed by it and I don't share the general adulation of other reviewers, amateur and professional.My viewing experience was also rather strange. At 53 I'm well used to being a very unimportant part of the demographic - I 'get' that I'm not supposed to be a movie fan. That important role is left to the 18 to 30 age group. (We'll ignore that I have 2 kids in that age category who go to the movies one tenth as often as I do<U+0085>) So finding myself in a movie theatre full of people far older than me was a slightly unnerving experience. And I haven't shared a movie viewing with such a vocal audience since Brokeback Mountain, and, just like BBM, the audience laughed heartily. I'm still digesting quite why. Gran Torino is mildly amusing in places but really, it's not that funny. It's tragic. The genuinely hearty laughter from the 'mature' audience at all the racist jokes left me mildly bemused.Eastwood plays embittered Korean War vet, and ex Ford car plant worker Walt, who has been recently widowed. He's being patronized by a wet-behind-the-ears young priest who promised his late wife that he'd keep an eye on Walt for her. He's hung on in the old neighborhood even as it's got rougher and tougher as various migrant groups have moved in, his family are pretty much waiting for him to die so they can inherit whatever goodies there are, and, the final insult for our politically incorrect hero, a family of Asians (Hmoung) live next door. And they are not heavily into lawn care. Walt pretty much thinks an Asian is an Asian and they're all equally undesirable as neighbours, after all he fought them in a war. He's an old school racist.When the son Thao (Bee Vang) attempts <U+0096> very ineptly <U+0096> to steal Walt's muscle car, a '72 Ford Gran Torino, as part of a gang initiation he doesn't want to do, Walt gives him a series of chores as retribution, and a tentative father-son relationship ensues. Thao's brighter and westernised sister Sue (Ahney Her) becomes the conduit via which Walt and the neighbours start to interact. The point is somewhat labored that Walt lives alone, alternately ignored or patronized by his family who clearly find him tedious, while the Hmoung all seem to live in one big happy extended family with granny cheerfully spitting on the front porch. Walt digs out his old war weapon and chases off the gang when they harass Thao, thus becoming an unlikely neighbourhood hero. Grateful, they smother him with food and hospitality whether he wants it or not, but trouble is brewing that will eventually lead to tragedy. Alongside the story of Walt, the gang and his neighbours is the coming of age tale of the eager young priest (Christopher Carley), and Walt's failing health.So far so good. The movie isn't too badly written and its heart is in the right place. It seems a little out of date now <U+0096> with the economy in freefall and construction jobs being shed faster than a Labrador's hair, I doubt Walt could really get a totally inexperienced kid a job on a building site no matter how well he knew the Irish foreman <U+0096> and I found Walt's attempt to teach Thao 'manly' interaction at the barber's shop fairly excruciating <U+0096> wherever these guys live it's apparently still 1957. Walt hates everyone including his own sons and grandchildren but the thought that they might have gained their family values from him never seems to occur to him.The cinematography is good with the house interiors, the neighbourhood, the yards and the church all looking genuinely authentic. But the movie sags in the middle and feels very contrived, all the characters are one dimensional and the acting is best described as adequate. If this were not Eastwood, and he were not 78, I doubt this would be scoring 8.5 out of 10 (as it is at the time of writing) on IMDb. In fact, I doubt it would have gotten made. It lacks any real bite, and is fairly predictable. It's not actively bad, but it's simply not as good as it could be or as many IMDb reviewers seem to think it is, and Eastwood is in danger of becoming a parody of himself. There is a level on which I think it appeals to the audience's basest instincts, and I'm still disquieted by all that hearty laughter from my cinema companions. But maybe it's me."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,tamemlin,1,comedy,2010,1,"I cannot understand why this film has received such a high rating. It's slow, moany and not in the least bit funny. Jason Segel is not leading man material. And neither is his penis.The characters are all unlikable, one dimensional bores. There's no set-pieces whatsover, just a long string of static scenes that have no edge. You don't even get many shots of beautiful Hawaii. It's just really weak film-making.The one plus-point is Mila Kunis, who is a cut above everybody else, and Paul Rudd does his best to improvise some life into his weak role. But there's still no laughs to be had here. Avoid this trash."
The Reader             ,MartinHafer,1,drama,2011,9,"This is a very strange movie in that there are MANY moral dilemmas and situations that clearly are unsavory--yet the film takes a completely neutral stance in presenting the plot. I am sure this offended some but it did make for a very memorable film. As for me, I am still not sure what I think about this strange style of film making.The movie begins with a 16 year-old boy being seduced by a much older woman. The morality of this and their subsequent affair never seems to matter---it just is. During this time, the older woman (Kate Winslet) was often quite moody and the boy's welfare really didn't seem that important. Also, she would force him to read to him before they had sex. Why is an important part of the film--and frankly, though it was apparently supposed to be a twist, I figure this out immediately. However, this didn't spoil the film.One day, Winslet disappears. Exactly why you really don't know. The boy grows and is now in law school. As part of one of his seminar classes, he and the class go to court to observe. The case involves some Nazi war criminals--and it turns out Winslet is among the defendants. And, the fact that she had other 'readers' finally makes the young man realize why. Winslet (this is NOT much of a spoiler) is illiterate. Yet, she is so ashamed of this, she is willing to accept a much longer sentence to hide her illiteracy. And, during her long incarceration, the ex-lover (now played by Ralph Fiennes) makes it his life duty to record book after book for her to enjoy while incarcerated. There's a bit more to the film than this, but I'll leave it up to you to see for yourself.The movie has some excellent acting, though I did wonder why the leads were played by non-Germans--while some other major characters were German-speaking actors (like the Swiss-born Bruno Ganz). I wonder why they didn't just have Germans in all the roles. Perhaps they thought it was more bankable with Fiennes and Winslet. The moody music and direction were perhaps the best part of the film, however---very evocative and well done.As for the plot, I cannot completely reconcile myself with the fact that the film appeared to possibly condone or was indifferent to evil. Sexual exploitation of a teen and the holocaust are BAD....REEEEAAAL bad! And that made me a bit uneasy, as I enjoyed the film and the odd plot. Also, I felt that it was a shame there was so much nudity, as I would love for teens to see the film--it would be great to show them to instigate discussions and provoke exploration.A weird and unique film. Hard to really describe and one you may enjoy but also one that may prove too challenging--as I could really see this causing some viewers to become angry, depressed or too emotionally taxing.By the way, was it just me or am I right that it seems that Fiennes' character wasted his life? And, interestingly, Fiennes also starred in the excruciatingly dull ""The English Patient""--another VERY morally ambiguous film about the Nazis and moral choice"
Goodbye Solo             ,fly4awhiteguy17,0,drama,2009,2,"This movie is simply painful to watch. I don't mean artistically painful as in the emotionally stimulating, thought-provoking manner of movies like Crash... but rather like the mind-numbing pain of standing in the customer service line at Walmart for 2 hours, just to get your money back.""Goodbye Solo"" glories in the mundane, but not in a crafty or interesting way, like Quentin Tarantino does. All of the main characters feel like they were cast directly from the site PeopleofWalmart.com. Now, imagine focusing in on the minutia of these people's lives, through various often unintelligibly-thick accents (African, Hispanic and Ebonics) for 90 painful minutes, and you get a good feel for what to expect in Goodbye Solo.To make matters worse, this film was poorly edited. Cuts between scenes are sluggish, and frankly, amateur. It felt like they were trying to stuff in extra seconds of screen time at every angle, desperately reaching for it's 90 minute run-time. There are exceptionally long moments that just linger on-screen, with no interest, no action, and worst of all, no real purpose. Cars will drive in and then out of a shot, while the camera lingers, showing nothing but pavement. We see unnecessarily long scenes such as filling a car with gas, without purpose. We watch extra characters stand and stare blankly for an extended period, then slowly walk out of frame, while the camera looks at an uninteresting and empty scene. The cinematography itself was acceptable (though not inspiring), but completely ruined by horrible editing.I made the mistake of watching this movie after seeing all of the rave-reviews on IMDb (7.5/10) and Rotten Tomatoes (94%), which usually help guide my movie selection. For the life of me, I cannot imagine how this movie was enjoyed by that many people.I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars for being utterly mundane. You deserve to be warned"
I Sell the Dead             ,Argemaluco,,misc,2010,8,"The horror comedy is much more difficult to work with as it seems.Many screenwriters and directors think ""comedy"" equals to ""incompetence"", and they think the quality from the movie will not care as long as it is funny.What they almost always forget is that it is equally difficult to make a good comedy and a good horror film, so they do not notice they are doubling the audience's expectations, and that they are risking themselves to fail them by double-entry.Needless to say that the result is not good in most of the times, but it is occasionally possible to find a movie such as I Sell the Dead, which is authentically ingenious on its genre combination.This may not be an excellent film, but I took a nice surprise with it and it kept me very entertained.The best element from I Sell the Dead is the cast.Dominic Monaghan knew how to canalize the fame he won in The Lord of the Rings trilogy in order to make a career in TV, appearing on series such as Lost, Chuck and Flash Forward; and even though I occasionally find him to be antipathetic, he brings a very competent performance in I Sell the Dead.Ron Perlman does not need an introduction to the fans of fantastic cinema, and despite the brevity of his character in here, he brings an entertaining development.Angus Scrimm (the Tall Man in the Phantasm saga) is perfect as a villain.And finally, even though the name of Larry Fessenden is not very famous on his actor facet, he was responsible as a director and screenwriter of two occult gems of the fantastic cinema: Wendigo and The Last Winter.In I Sell the Dead, Fessenden shows he is also talented as an actor.The screenplay is also worthy of mention because it tells us a solid story at the same time it satirizes some popular horror sub-genera, from vampires and zombies to other ones I do not wanna mention because I would ruin the surprise.But ""satire"" may not be the appropriate word in this case; the screenplay simply incorporates those elements on a natural way, and it leaves the characters to explore the situations with their dry humor.The fails I found on this movie is that some supporting characters are not very well drawn, and there are some things which feel a bit forced in the screenplay.However, I had a very entertaining time watching I Sell the Dead.As I mentioned, it may not be a great film, but it has enough positive elements to deserve a honest recommendatio"
I Sell the Dead             ,dagonseve,,misc,2010,5,"What's this? Another recent title? It'd be ridiculous for your fellow ghoul not to keep current with today's releases. I'll try to keep this one brief because I'm still unsure of my opinion in terms of the outcome.I Sell the Dead is about a man by the name of Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan, commonly recognizable as Charlie from Lost and also a hobbit in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) who confesses his grave robbing crimes to a priest named Father Duffy (your neighborhood friendly Ron Pearlman). Set in the Victorian era, Blake goes into detail concerning the exploits of his misadventures with his partner Willie. They soon come into contact with a rival grave-plundering gang led by the vicious corpsegrinder Cornelius Murphy. Several twists and turns are contained within peppered by obvious comedic elements. Unfortunately, I've seen better attempts at black comedy on BET. As I mentioned earlier, rating this film is not an easy task. Part of me thoroughly enjoyed the artistic approach and silly premise. On the other hand, I had a difficult time interpreting the pace. Several scenes felt disjointed and out-of-place, leaving me to ponder whether or not it was intentional. The acting is solid, of course. If you enjoy the mixture of comedy and horror (which, to be honest, I'm touchy about) then I would recommend checking this one out. Shut your brain off and enjoy the show...just don't expect anything groundbreaking"
The Merry Gentleman             ,rddj05,,crime,2010,3,"I applaud Keaton for taking his shot behind the camera. However, when I watched the film, I did not know he had directed it. But sometimes, as an audience member, you simply get the feeling about 10-15 minutes in, that you may not in very reliable, or skilled hands. That was the case with The Merry Gentleman.The problems mainly lay with the script. There are FAR too many improbabilities and convenient coincidences in the story to make it believable, and these start to become more and more noticeable as the film goes on. By the time I got half-way through the film, I still didn't have much of an idea of what the central motive of either character was, especially Michael Keaton, and after awhile, I began to stop caring. Michael Keaton plays a professional hit-man, though we never know for who, or why, or even anything about his targets. All we know is that he appears to be terribly sad about it. He is suicidal (the way his first attempt is foiled is practically out of a Buster Keaton comedy), but I would think that a character who was a professional hit-man would come up with far simpler and effective methods to off himself than the ones he attempts in the movie. A gun, maybe? Also, if he's so tortured about what he does, wouldn't make sense for him to kill himself BEFORE you completes another job?? We never really find out much about this character as he slowly moves through the film mumbling a word here or a word there. Even in a scene in a hospital scene that appears to be inserted into the film to try and give the audience some idea of who this character is, we still get nothing...and that nothing takes a whole lot of time to get to. There is a strange plot twist in the 2nd half of the film, where writer tries to tie up the loose end of the abusive husband. All I can say is that it involves yet another convenient coincidence involving a business card to a local hotel.Kelly McDonald, a fine actress, is really the lead of the film, but even here the writer didn't give her character much logic to work with. The film opens with her leaving her abusive husband after he gives her a nasty shiner. Somehow, within a few days, she is suddenly in a new city, with a new job. Just like that. How this all happened, again is a mystery. Even though the black eye is something she'd rather hide and not talk about, she bizarrely shows up at an office Christmas party where she certainly must know that she'll be asked about it repeatedly (which, of course, she is) . Obviously not wanting to jump into any new relationships due to her abusive past, she rejects the advances of a few of her new co- workers, but then inexplicably falls for Michael Keaton's character after one brief run-in, who, in their first meeting, comes off as a bit, well....creepy. For a smart girl, she also seems completely clueless that a police officer investigating a case she's involved in as a witness, is interested in her romantically. The light takes a while to go on apparently.All and all, there's never enough of anyone's life to really dig into, but more a 2-dimensional picture of it all. The look and tone of the film is a bit of a mess. There is a slew of completely unmotivated camera moves and cuts that defy all logic, almost as if Keaton was terrified of having the film look too plain. As a result, it winds up being a mishmash of different styles that belong in a dozen different films. This could also be said of the mind-boggling score and music cues. In the end, it seems like the film really didn't know what it wanted to be; sometimes a gritty drama, sometimes a Billy Wilder comedy, sometimes a teary melodrama, and sometimes a Basic Instinct-type thriller. Though the last 20 minutes of the film do actually do manage to build some tension through proper pacing, the ending is simply befuddling. There's a difference between leaving an ending open because you want to challenge the audience into thinking about what might happen, and leaving an ending open because you simply can't come up with a proper or satisfying one. I can only imagine that this film got made because the writer knew Keaton, Keaton signed on to play the (quite undeveloped) lead role, and the financing followed from there"
The Dark Knight             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,action,2008,10,"I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10 6"
Surveillance             ,djderka,1,crime,2010,9,"EXTERIOR: DAY- HIGHWAYThree cars in line in a wide shot. A brown van with family (and kids), a red/white Duster with two coke heads and a cop car with two psycho cops. Cars in middle of the frame, clouds in b.g. grasslands in foreground. Oh, the cops shoot out tires on travelers cars so they can harass and dominate them. The tension in that shot sets the tone for the whole movie. You will see why. Ms. Lynch sure knows pacing,composition, tension, angles, wow!That Ms. Lynch made this for only 3.5 mil is really astounding. That the movie grossed under a 100K is baffling. The movie is not sick. The CHARACTERS are. All of them. And you can't help getting caught up in their lives.This is so well done...it hurts. And it shows what you can do on a low, low budget with professionalism. Cast, crew, lighting, sound, direction, all on the mark.I am going to write a script so Ms. Lynch can direct it...really.This kind of movie intrigues me like Pulp Fiction. It is character and dialog. Most films have boring dialog that moves the lame plot along. But not this hidden gem.SEE IT ! Don't talk about it. And show it to your friends.Bravo"
Lakeview Terrace             ,mr_popcorn,0,crime,2008,7,"A nicely done thriller thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's terrifying performance as the uptight father and a ruthless cop and some powerful support performances from Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. I am not familiar with some of Neil LaBute's previous efforts but Lakeview Terrace gives off a good impression. He handles the subject of racism pretty well. Its not overdone, its not too preachy, it just told a fairly good story and that was it. No pretensions, no melodramatic mumbo jumbo that has often plagued films that takes on such delicate topics on screen. It topped the box-office when it was released all thanks to Samuel J's star power and here's hoping more people will see this movie. If you want your daily dose of thrillers, then Lakeview Terrace is a must see. But don't expect much though, its just a little film taking on big, controversial subjects that is relevant in this day and age"
Death Race             ,mgayles2005,0,action,2008,8,"""Death Race"" puts me in a moral dilemma. Its deliberately trashy, shallow and inept, and for some reason I still like it. Making my feelings even more conflicted is the fact that it was directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a director who tries to turn movies into video games, and always fails. But as they say in Hollywood ""you're only as good as your last picture"" so Anderson is as good as anyone right now.Not too far into the future our economy has collapsed (maybe McCain won), poverty reigns supreme and crime has become unstoppable. The prisons are filled beyond capacity, and Americas number one form of entertainment is watching the inmates fight to the death. The fights to the death got old and America needed something new. Death Race was invented. The concept is the same as death fighting, only you slug it out in an armor plated car with machine guns. The last man alive wins, and if you win enough races, you win your freedom.Enter Jensen Ames, a former Nascar driver prior to his prison conviction, who loses his job when the local steel mill is closed. He goes home to his wife and infant daughter, only to have a masked man break in and kill his wife. Ames is framed for the crime and sent to prison.Ames is sent to prison, where the warden Hennessey, played with excellent restraint by Joan Allen, informs him that he must replace Frankenstein, the most popular death racer, if he is ever to leave the prison. Ames agrees, and the games begin.As a satire ""Death Race"" completely miss fires. The opening prologue informs us of the downfall of American society, and its never brought up again. Were informed that Death Race has become more popular then the Super Bowl with more then seventy million viewers but we never see one of those people watching. For some reason the drivers are paired with sexy women to navigate, even though they have a pit crew to do that. The women are in it for ratings, to make a statement about our own for sex as well as violence, but the viewers cant see the women inside the cars, so how do they help ratings? Just a few examples of the missed satire.But this isn't an Oliver Stone movie. When you buy a ticket to see ""Death Race"", you want to see some death and some racing. And you get both, but mostly death. The racing scenes are electrifying. The combination of great stunt work, special effects and art direction give this films action the boost of adrenaline it craves. Andersons vision is to immerse us in a ""Twisted Metal"" video game, and he pulls it off with magnificent results. He captures the sadistic mentality of ""Twisted Metal"" perfectly. One driver turns his car around just to shoot another driver.""You cant drive backwards"" his partner remarks<U+0085>I beg to differ. That scene will remind ""Grand Theft Auto"" fans of many rampages.Anderson keeps his eyes on the finish line and ""Death Race"" moves towards its conclusion in a heart beat. Despite my immersion in the story, it was way too predictable. The framed for murder set up is too obvious, and before you can even figure it out for yourself they give it away. And as for the ending, only a few things can happen at the end a prison movie, and you know what they are. But despite the twists you can see coming a mile away, they're still satisfying. ""Death Race"" is one of the few examples where a bad script can become a good movie.The acting is wonderful all around. Jason Statham is a read deal action super star. He's got the physique of Van Damme and a million times the acting ability. His character's quest to see his daughter gives the film its only sliver of humanity, and all a prison movie needs is a sliver.Joan Allen as the warden plays her character so tightly she could probably crack a cashew with her but cheeks. Hennessey is so tightly wound I often wondered is she was going to implode. And towards the end she gets a chance to deliver some perfectly timed profanity. Maybe the last four letter words you;; ever hear out of her mouth.Newcomer Natalie Martinez has infinite sex appeal as Case, the sexy vixen who rides in the passenger seat beside Ames. But more then a pretty face she gets a chance to act, and proves shell be around for years to come. Ian McShane is perfect as the simply named Coach. His job is to coach. His weathered face and gravelly voice perfectly fit's the prototype of a man who's spent a long time in prison. But he was good in a stinker like ""Hot Rod"", so its no surprise here.Director Paul W.S Anderson has always attempted to make his films into video games, and ""Death Race"" really does play like a video game. That's the films intention and it works. It satisfies the blood lust lurking deep within us all. Society hasn't gotten to the point where we watch snuff films but watching fictional people kill each other is still loads of fun, and so is ""Death Race"".¾ stars"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,BenAordure,,adventure,2011,NA,"Comments are so tough with the film that I feel alone in the camp of the ""positives"".OK this film is far from being a perfection and I think I will never understand the very purpose of it. I even hesitate to say what was the topic. I assume it was about the coming-out of the main character, but even that I am not sure.Plus, I can't say Jon Foster, the main actor, is captivating. So why did I like ?I think the main thing I appreciated in that film is the atmosphere of mysteries. As the title suggests it, all along the film provides an imperceptible mystery. Because it plays with suggestions and switches. The storyline helps for sure to plunge into this atmosphere as the storyline is a mystery in itself ! But there are other causes. The photography for example, which clearly remains in my mind. Although Pittsburg is not a beauty on its own, the director manages to capture some good photos of it. Also the director did well regarding the changing weathers and lights. Switching between sun and rain, lights, twillights and darkness.The soundtrack follows the mysterious atmosphere well too.Saarsgard plays an interesting character as he acts an ambivalent tough but sensitive bi-sexual. There is also the constant hesitations of the main character. Obey his father or not ? The dark haired girl or the blond one ? The girlfriend or the boyfriend ? We can also capture the questionings of all the others characters.All this provides a sentiment of interrogations.So this atmosphere the director manages to render leads us not to be surprised when the main character admits at the end he is confused, because this is the feeling we have too.Mysteries. This is what I appreciated in this film I gues"
Goodbye Solo             ,jeff_ginsburg,0,drama,2009,9,"Solo was a relentlessly optimistic character, regardless of the setback, he rebounded immediately. Or, he brought himself back to a sunny state by a deep and touching effort that was illuminated with care and beauty. The older man, William, on the otherhand, worked hard to maintain his life-has-beaten-me-down disposition. So when a happy/touching moment overtakes him, the director shares the ray of hope, the precious glimmer of being touched despite himself. So the film is filled with these gems welling from opposite natures pushing against each other. The buds of nature push forth despite the obstacles. Solo was the everchanging sunshine in this film.The pacing was not rushed and only 1 or 2x did I find myself saying ""I got it, move on"". The acting was genuine and I was amazed how everday, duldrum existence was portrayed with compassion among people who have little possessions, yet no glories imposed, no moments of drama asking for viewer's awe (i.e. Streepless).The cinematography was expertly crafted: people were positioned that complimented and complemented the background scene. The bleakness of the tobacco-industry sooted parts of town was not beautified, rather its interest captivated me in showing its richness in layers of aging infrastructure moaning as a tired, old beast. Again, I was consistently sated when I looked at the mis-en-scene.This film is a big reward for seeking out independent, small-budget films---something I seldom have with any film."
Gomorrah             ,MaxBorg89,,crime,2008,10,"In 2003, Giancarlo De Cataldo, a judge-turned-novelist, wrote Romanzo Criminale (Crime Novel in English), a largely truthful recollection (only the names were changed) of the Magliana gang, a Roman crime organization he had sentenced to prison. Three years later, Neapolitan journalist Roberto Saviano wrote Gomorra, a first-hand, non-fiction analysis of how organized crime controls everything in his native region. The book was the result of months of direct contact with the people who keep the System (the gangsters themselves refuse to use the word Camorra, which can be considered the local version of the Sicilian Mafia) and became a huge success, the downside of which was Saviano receiving multiple death threats from the people he'd exposed and being forced to live with a permanent police escort. The reason I'm mentioning both books is they were both made into successful films (Gomorra even walked away with the Grand Prize of the Jury at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival), with one crucial difference: Romanzo Criminale is very good, but does at times, as implied by the title, feel like a novel, a fictional story. Gomorra, on the other hand, using the same raw, in-your-face style as City of God, throws the viewer into a new, scary world - the real deal.Director Matteo Garrone, who co-wrote the screenplay with a bunch of collaborators (including Saviano himself), wisely decides to ditch the book's first-person storytelling, the only (possible) reference to the author being a young man named Roberto who helps businessman Franco (Toni Servillo) close a series of suspicious deals with various companies in the North of Italy (Venice is explicitly shown). Franco's line of work, which will sound amusing to anyone who's watched The Sopranos, is waste management, though not of the legal kind. His story is one of five that constitute the film's narrative: along with him, there's also Don Ciro (Gianfelice Imparato), who pays the family members of imprisoned crooks; Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo), a tailor whose life is at risk because of his contacts with the Chinese (Italians don't like competition) and whose work ends up being worn by celebrities like Scarlett Johansson (Angelina Jolie in the book); and then there are two different examples of young blood, one a loyal boy who runs errands for his drug-dealing neighbors, the other two young punks who have watched Scarface way too often (a reference to the fact that a real-life Camorra boss had his villa designed exactly like Tony Montana's) and think they can take over.An ensemble gangster flick, then. Not quite: this is no Altman movie, which means the separate plot strands never once cross paths. This is because Gomorra doesn't set out to be a real, straightforward story, but rather offer a series of bleak, extremely real examples of how the Camorra (or the System, though neither word is ever spoken in the film) controls everything. Aside from the documentary-style cinematography and anxious cutting, the highest degree of realism comes from the cast: the only really famous actor in the film is Servillo, familiar from Paolo Sorrentino's filmography; the rest have a theatrical background or, in the case of the kids especially, were taken directly from the street (the movie was shot on location, and rumor has it the mother of a Camorra boss asked for a cameo). This shows most clearly in the way they speak: with few exceptions (Franco most notably), the characters' Neapolitan dialect is so strong the film had to be subtitled in most parts of Italy. Garrone and Saviano's message is clear: this isn't your usual genre flick, it's something else - something palpable, something real, something terrifying.Gomorra's top achievement is that it doesn't play to the stereotype of Italy being nothing but the home of gangsters. On the contrary, it pinpoints a sad fact, its intent being to denounce and make aware, never to glorify. Sure, it opens with a shootout that could remind of Goodfellas (still one of the best first-hand crime tales) or The Sopranos, but even those masterpieces are too smooth and polished next to the gritty, unsettling universe that emerges from this film. It's dirty, brutal, scary. And it simply has to be seen. "
The Express             ,ctomvelu1,,misc,2009,7,"Loosely based on the life of the first black football player to win the Heisman Trophy, this follows a chap named Ernie Davis -- a name most viewers are unlikely to be familiar with -- throughout his school years. When he reaches Syracuse College, he finds he is one of two black players on his team. His coach is played by Dennis Quaid. The period was just far enough back in time that there were very few black football players, and in some states, blacks could not stay in the same hotels or attend social functions with whites. All of this is dealt with in a forthright manner, although some facts have been slightly altered to punch home the drama of the era. Quaid's coach is a gruff old man with a heart of gold, a role Quaid likely will be playing more and more often as he ages. You may not recognize many of the actors in this, but they are uniformly excellent. Worth a watch, even if you dislike footbal"
Four Christmases             ,jcb163,1,comedy,2008,1,"Sophomoric humor, disjointed plot, obnoxious delivery, lack of direction, and poor pacing married to a feeble attempt to intertwine a serious philosophical issue throughout its unbelievably contrived and stilted storyline (the issue was whether or not to bring offspring into the world, but by the end you have come to have so much disdain for the main characters that you are practically screaming, ""Please, don't breed!"" by the time they do). Overall, just a superbly painful movie to sit through. Further, it was most disheartening to see a stellar collection of supporting actors (Duval, Spacek, Voight) wasted in a horrendous vehicle such as this one. My recommendation is that if you can watch it for free . . . you will still have paid too much. This is a Christmas movie quickly destined for the post-Christmas gift exchange department.On a brighter note, my wife hated it more than I did."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,Twins65,,adventure,2013,NA,"I must 1st admit I've not read the book, which apparently is way better than this film adaptation according to the general consensus here at IMDb. I was warned to stay far away from this movie.But I FINALLY saw it anyway, almost 7 full years after Sienna Miller made entertainment headlines trashing Pittsburgh in an interview while filming there on location. The film wasn't easy to track down, as I found a DVD through an interlibrary loan. I'm glad I watched it, but can't really recommend it.As indie movies go, I thought it had decent production values, including respected actors (Nolte, Sarsgaard, Suvari & Miller). I was unfamiliar with the work of Jon Foster (but his brother Ben can really bring it at times), and thought he was just OK as the lead. Perhaps a more dynamic young actor would have brought more to the production, but he's not the reason I'm giving this a below-average rating.The story was decent enough, but it just never really felt like I was watching a movie set in '83. Outside of Sienna's beat up VW Beetle and Sarsgaard's convertible, there was nothing to peg this as ""early 80's""! I realize Pittsburgh has had roughly the same look for years, but couldn't they at least have thrown in some more ""visuals"" or music from that era to bring home it was 1983? The producers could have used more early 80's indie rock during the movie if they couldn't afford the rights for major label material from that era. And that punk club scene looked more like something you'd see in a retro themed inner-city dive in Chicago these days than a packed bar in Pitt. 30 years ago. I'm giving this 1 extra star (4 instead of 3) for having the punk band play a cover of The Replacements' God Damn Job off their '82 EP ""Stink"". I never, ever thought I'd hear that cut in movie! This movie is worth a look only if it pops up on IFC or Sundance at some point, but I've never seen it playing ther"
Nim's Island             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,adventure,2008,5,"My friends and I decided to see Nim's Island tonite, I work at a theater and have walked in on a couple parts and it looked cute, so I figured it might be a fun watch. Honestly, Nim's Island is a good family film, decent enough for a watch, but I'm a little disappointed with what I was expecting. Just I think the ideas are a little beyond out there and I don't think this is the type of film that is going to keep a lot of kid's attention. It's just not memorable, it has it's cute moments here and there, now Abigail Breslin pulls in a decent enough performance to make the film watchable, but again, like her last film Definitely Maybe, it seems like she's getting the star's bug, which worries me because she has so much potential and her performances she doesn't seem to care too much since her Oscar nomination. But it's Jodie Foster's performance that majorly disappointed me, it was too forced and made the story more ridicules that what it already was.Nim is a little girl who lives on an island with her dad who is an adventurer. Now they have not told anyone where they are and their living place, good idea if they need help, right? Well, her dad goes on a research assignment, and gets hit by a nasty storm stranding him in the middle of no where. When Nim gets an E-Mail from famous author, Alex Rover, who she thinks is a real life hero, Alex wants answers about volcano's for her next book, but Nim wants help since she's alone on the island and her dad hasn't returned. Alex has one problem, she's agoraphobic, but gets the strength to go on an adventure and help Nim out with the help of her famous character Alex Rover to get through this Indiana Jones ordeal.Nim's Island is a cute movie, I would never ever say in a million years that this is a bad movie, because it is worth a look. Just I would recommend that you wait for the rental, this is not the Horton Hears a Who of the year, it's a movie that is forgettable unfortunately, it just needed more help with the script and the actors needed to bring it a little more down to Earth since the story is supposed to be fairy tale like, you'll see what I mean if you see this movie. But like I said, wait for the rental, it's a nice family film, but isn't the best movie of Spring 2008.5/10"

The main character of this movie can tell it very well<U+0085>It's a nice movie about this subject and it shows us the frightening world of Las Vegas casinos'.

The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,stensson,1,misc,2008,8,"I don't really understand this amount of objections towards this movie. It doesn't try to moralize. It doesn't have a mission. Instead it's a fair attempt to explain the different terrorist characters through dialog and interaction. Why did they start the movement, why did they stay there and why were some of them hesitant? The time and the way of behaving in the West Germany of the period is well reconstructed. And especially Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wakalek are splendid.The terrorism of the era is a riddle, but here you get some clues, Subjective, but anyway"
I Sell the Dead             ,Llakor,,misc,2009,7,"I Sell the Dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. This has advantages and drawbacks. The 85 minutes of the film breeze by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes gory, occasionally all three at once, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the film's parts.The story, such as it is, follows professional grave robber Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's partner-in-crime Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just had his head chopped off for murder and Arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeit for the same crime. Arthur insists that he is innocent of murder, but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when bribed with Irish Whisky by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman).Since the movie is a series of grave-robbing anecdotes confessed by Arthur, it becomes a sort of horror anthology - a series of disjointed tales, all linked by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie) and a similar theme (grave robbing). Like most horror anthologies, there is no consistent mythology, because all mythologies are true and happening simultaneously even when they contradict one another.It probably didn't help that I saw this film the same night as Trick 'r Treat, a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that I Sell The Dead falls into. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified, consistent story than I Sell The Dead which is intended to be a united narrative.The other problem with the film (and I recognize that this is insane nit-picking) is the way the film plays fast and loose with history. Grimes is killed with a Guillotine. We might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a Scottish Maiden, a precursor to the French Guillotine, but the Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set a good hundred years later since Burke and Hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829. Grave robbing as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the Anatomy Act (1832) so the film must take place before then.I know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy off of. And it's not like the history of grave robbers or body snatchers or resurrectionists (call it what you like) is a boring story.The most frustrating thing is that writer.director Glenn McQuaid clearly does know the history, especially the good bits. As an example, when Grimes first takes on Arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to Arthur that as resurrectionists, they don't steal the clothes from the dead, because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor, punishable by a small fine, while stealing clothes is a felony, punishable by deportation or possibly even death. So you would expect Wille and Arthur to strip the corpse at this point (and for the rest of the film) but of course they don't. You could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script, but not when the writer and the director are the same person.My point isn't that there should have been a lot of buck-naked corpses in the film, my point is that if you are going to bring up this quirk in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is, than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion, even if that means that Willie and Arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and stuffing them back in the empty coffin, so that they don't get deported for stealing the walking corpse's clothes, otherwise don't bring up the matter at all.Historical nerdiness aside, I Sell The Dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more."
W.             ,munky_funky,0,misc,2008,1,"After watching Stone's latest biopic, I feel like I have lived through George Bush's life. No I have no new understanding of the man's life, I just feel like I waisted 40 years of my own life all in the matter of 2 hours. This movie adds a whole new meaning to boring. This movie managed to show us every aspect of George's life besides those that might be interesting. We got to see some girl friend??? of George's step on a cob of corn. Why?? Is there some symbolism here. We get to see George be out Texased by some Democratic rival for state senate, but when he is going to make his out Texasing comeback against the Governor of Texas, we are just informed he won. Why not show it? But by far the worst two things about this movie have got to be the actress representing Condilice Rice and the choice of background music. First, Condi. I am not a big fan of the woman, but my god, what was the decision to present her as a mentally challenged freak with facial ticks. And why does she act more like George's secretary than a deputy of the NSA and then future Secretary of State. I do not know who the actress was as of yet, but I can guarantee you that I will never watch another movie that she is in ever again. She alone made me hate this movie more anything else in any other previous movie. Now the music. Stone should know better. The sappy crap music reminded me of the dramatic under filler for the series Jericho. It was the music that destroyed the whole series of Jericho. And for all you peanut lovers out there, I can care less about your peanuts. I am glad Jericho was canceled."
Ponyo             ,dave-it,1,animation,2008,7,"As a long-time fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films, I went to the film right on the opening day. When I went out of the theater I had this strange feeling that something was missing, this ""magical"" feeling I was experiencing in all Miyazaki films before, but I couldn't say why it failed this time. After I thought about the other Ghibli movies, I may know the reason: this film had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animation film. However, two elements were lacking: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of ""Totoro"", so a complicated story as been told in ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect to the main characters, because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really hate to give only 7 stars for a Miyazaki film, because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away, but this time it was simply not this wonderful ""ghibli experience"". 1"
The Escapist             ,bob the moo,,crime,2009,NA,"Frank Perry is twelve years into a life sentence when he learns that his estranged daughter has become a junkie on the outside. Unable to do anything for her from his cell and unwilling to wait till he gets out, Frank comes up with a base plan to escape from the prison and brings several other prisoners on board to assist him. The escape itself can be worked out to detail and timings but in the meantime it is the days leading up to the escape that prove to be the more testing in a world of betrayal, power, rape, murder and drug use.Watching the trailer for this film some time ago I was left not particularly fussed about whether I got to see it or not <U+0096> it just looked like I expected and offered little. The generally good reviews made me check it out when it was released on DVD though and I'm glad that I did because this is a much better film than it looks on the trailer. It is not that the plot is something different from a prison movie , although it is a little, it is the manner of delivery that makes the film work as well as it does. The concept is strong but it is the editing and structure that are the driving forces here. We start the film in two places. On one hand we are with the group as they start their escape attempt, while on the other hand we are some time before this when Frank gets his motivation to escape.What this structure does is increase the tension by having two dramatic threads happening at the same time, with the escape itself delivering the pace to pay off against the build-up that is happening at the same time in the other thread. Rather than building up to the escape then the film does both at the same time and it is an effective and engaging technique. The point where one thread catches the other isn't totally convincing in some regards and I'll not be the only person to express a slight doubt at the dramatic punch of the conclusion but, with being caught up in the story so effectively up till this point, it does work and the way that it slightly undoes the impact of some of the film that had gone before is not a killer of a problem so much as it is a minor niggle.Wyatt's direction is roundly good and, as co-writer, he makes the most of the structure and material. It helps of course when your debut feature has an impressive collection of actors and performances <U+0096> and Wyatt's does. As he also showed in Red recently, Cox makes an engaging leading man when given the chance. Fiennes is not quite so good as he perhaps overdoes his swagger and toughness <U+0096> still looks the part and does well but again he is a slight niggle. I liked Cunningham's turn as well as Cooper <U+0096> although the latter had a bit of a wet and less engaging character to work with. Brazilian musician Jorge was a bit of a weird find but did OK. Mackintosh is engaging and convincing in how he acts knowing he is technically untouchable due to the actions of his brother. Lewis is not in the film for much of the running time but his ""less is more"" approach produces a real menace when he is given the camera.The Escapist is a comparatively small British film full of faces you'll recognise but nobody who is a real ""leading man"" in film terms, directed by Wyatt making his feature debut after a few shorts to his name. However it is cleverly structured and delivered with a real sense of quality in the story, direction and performances. It is not perfect but it is much better than the trailer suggests and I was pleasantly surprised by how much it engaged me and how much I enjoyed it."
Fireflies in the Garden             ,IAN-Cinemaniac,0,drama,2008,3,"I'm an American living in Europe and usually when I see a film with such a fine cast released here before it is in the States an alarm goes off in my head. Normally that means the film is junk and they want to make some money back before word gets around. I read the 2 other IMDb reviews and thought maybe it's not too bad. I then read the Hollywood Reporter, and Variety's reviews, which were not as kind. But I decided to take a drive over to Maastricht, Holland to form my own opinion of FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN. The first 15 minutes I thought, okay maybe this cast can rise above the seemingly Lifetime special material. But in the end it was clear they couldn't. I've seen much finer Lifetime movies (because of my wife). I can't understand WHY the cast agreed to making this movie. The characters were inconsistent and the script was sloppy. It seemed as though a reel had gone missing, some footage had been erased or maybe they had forgotten to film 30 pages of the script. Characters make huge changes for no apparent reason. Plot points are mentioned but never followed through. I could go on forever but I'm not sure about what. There is no substance to FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN. It's a pure waste of your time and it's talent. Clearly they thought they were making a solid family drama like ORDINARY PEOPLE or IN THE BEDROOM but they certainly did not succeed on any level. So unfortunately my theory about the US dumping its cinematic junk on the rest of the world for a quick buck has proved true again."
Saw V             ,tachilaki-1,0,crime,2008,6,"Well, even though I was quite wary of this sequel (as I am of any series that goes past a third installment), I must say that Saw V is still pretty good. However, this might be one for fans only.The reason I say that is because the story this time around is not really all that necessary. Saw IV wrapped up the entire mess pretty good, leaving Special Agent Hoffman to carry on Jigsaw's legacy. This entry just reveals more backstory that, while still somewhat interesting, is not something anyone really needs to know. It doesn't wrap up any holes or really reveal anything new.In any case, this is a good entry, and I am amazed that the producers could keep it up for this long."
Kisses             ,reb_vodka_042099,1,drama,2008,NA,"I caught this movie in the 49th Thessaloniki Film Festival in Greece just yesterday, and I have to admit it was an unexpected gem, since you can't really have high expectations out of the movies in Film Festivals...Sweet, kind-hearted, honest, brave, wonderfully-outlined characters, wonderfully-developed scenario, all in all -an amazing film. I wish I could stumble upon movies like this more often. The cinematography and the direction are splendid. The Bob Dylan soundtrack tribute not only brings this movie to life, but makes it all the more stunning, as is the rotation between color and black-and-white; the film obtains color when the two protagonists are happy and it turns back to black-and-white when they are unhappy.I'm pretty content to have caught this diamond of a movie amongst the piles of rocks. Congratulations to all involved for truly bold film-making."
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,tedwilliams,0,animation,2008,1,"With the MASSIVE advertising this is getting on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that ilk, my son was bugging us to see it. Between DVD and the theaters, I've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or no kids. It was a ""when it this stupid thing going to end?"" kind of experience? OK, it's aimed at toddlers (or it better be - it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive, and slow-moving. Then once you're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over, there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but there isn't one - it's serious, though it's hard to tell what they're trying to accomplish. The 3-D effects... yeah, if you've never seen a Viewmaster they're a big deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it appears to be the same process). Even my son was bored by the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said ""wow"" at the end. Bad in every respect."
WALL·E             ,buiredintime,0,animation,2008,10,"I can't say enough about how good this movie, that you probably haven't read, so I'm going to keep this short.This is the best thing out there in theater's right now, and might just be the best animated film of all time, whether you believe that or not, is your own opinion, but what Pixar has done here, can put companies like Dreamworks, Sony, and Blue sky to shame.Wall E also may go down as the most lovable character ever to grace the movie screen, I praise Ben Burtt and Andrew Stanton, and the people at Pixar for what they did, and will continue to do.This is why Pixar is the top studio in the world.10/10 4"
The Brothers Bloom             ,toqtaqiya2,1,action,2012,8,"The Brothers Bloom is a shining comedy with a wonderful cast. It's an unusual film which in some ways reminds one of Wes Anderson's work. However, it's much more entertaining than any of Anderson's films. Leading the picture are Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody. They're both excellent as the two con men brothers. Ruffalo is especially charming as the older brother, but Brody is no less effective as the depressed younger brother. With them are Rachel Weisz and Rinko Kikuchi. Weisz managed to make her character seem cute, odd and very likable. Weisz is really at the center of the film. In addition, writer-director Rian Johnson really wanted Weisz in the role of Penelope Stamp. Actually, Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of admission. She's such a good actress, and she's one of my favorites. But there's so much more to like here. Rinko Kikuchi, who became famous because of her dramatic role in Babel (2006), had no problems playing a comedic role. The adventure of the main characters takes them to several picturesque locales. Despite all the traveling the humor keeps on coming, often in unusual ways. The cast do a very good job but most of the credit should go to Rian Johnson, who hasn't made a bad film yet. His work is intelligent, original and delightful. When I began watching it I didn't realize that The Brothers Bloom is, in my opinion, one of the best comedies of recent years. This is because I watched it to see Rachel Weisz, since I like her work. But this film is easily worth recommending. Also, I can't believe that this film underperformed at the box office. And how come it wasn't publicized much? What a sham"

Of course some of it's a bit far fetched but come on... Aren't MOST action movies? James MacAvoy did an amazing job playing the average joe who is suddenly told he has the ability in him to be a ""wolf among the sheep"" I enjoyed his American accent. Angelina was great. She does very well in roles like this and even though she doesn't have too many lines she pulls off her character who TRULY believes in what she does very well. Plus, she's hot.

The Duchess             ,eagleroost,1,misc,2009,9,"Flawless. This is so much more than a pretty costume piece. Yes, there is only one linear plot, but Kiera Knightly takes us so deeply into the story of her character, The Dutchess, that we are completely absorbed.This is no comedy of manners, as we are used to in so many period pieces. This is the story of a girl excited about her future, learning blow by blow what it means to be the wife/property of a powerful man. I was impressed that Kightly was able to portray the pain of her marriage and the deep love of a mother. Ralph Fiennes was perfect as the Duke. A man so used to his own power and privilege that it allowed him to live with no consideration for others. You don't like him, but you do understand him. I saw the love interest of the Dutchess, not in terms of an undeniable passion, but more as an attempt to snatch some shred of joy for herself in a life empty of love. In that respect, it was played convincingly. I am not sure that men will be able to relate to these themes, but women who have been married and have children will have their hearts torn by each painful compromise and decision. Somehow Knightly and/or the director manages to lead us through this tragic tale in a way that is moving instead of depressing. Despite its historical nature, this is not a family film as the sexual themes are for mature audience"
Trucker             ,John-310,1,drama,2011,NA,"Grossly under-rated film. True its theme is old stuff, but Michelle's performance should have garnered more attention. I just saw it on TV and didn't even know it existed. I hope the cable exposure gets it some more attention. Nathan had a great relaxed feeling to his acting and was pretty charming as the friend. Ben Bratt was surprisingly believable in the thankless role of the Dad... better writing could have elevated his role, but that would require more depth than the writer may have at this stage...I was riveted to Michelle and didn't know how it would end up decision-wise...I thought the set up for her decision was a bit over contrived to show her change.. could have been far more subtle . Her beautiful facial work could have handled it without the extra drama. Might have been more powerful.Still... she deserved at least an indie nomination"
Stop-Loss             ,E Canuck,0,drama,2008,8,"Just saw this film in an advance screening and once the tension and threat (very real) of the opening battle scenes were borne and past, the film grew on me, as the story became one of the soldiers at home: their war aftermath and their war that just won't quit or let them go.It occurred to me at one point this was quite like watching a ""Deer Hunter"" for the Iraq war. There were certainly similar aspects, including aspects of the soldiers' relationships with each other and with others at home, and in terms of the casualties and injuries that continue to pile up well after leaving the battlefield.Stop Loss is perhaps a more political film than the ""Deer Hunter"" was, because of the timing of its release, while the issues of the war in the film are still very much on the boil in the USA. I think it intends to position itself in a relevant and timely place, and time will tell whether it has staying power as a lasting and powerful war or antiwar film.There is enough humanity, good drama and strong acting in this picture that it may deserve a place in the lineup of memorable or important American war films.

Righteous Kill             ,villarreal-cesar,0,crime,2008,3,"One word, no, actually, two words to describe this film: TOTAL Disappointment (obviously for Robert Deniro and Al Pacino). If you're a fan of these two actors, and films like Heat, I recommend you NOT to see this film. And if you do, expect the worst (maybe that way you won't be that disappointed). The acting was sad but the worst part: the roles they play, they don't fit with their age. Tell me, how can a 68 year old or a 65 year old be a cop, lift weights, try to get in a fight with 30ish year old guys, jump a fence and not break both knees?? It doesn't fit, it doesn't look cool, it looks ridiculous and disappointing! I mean c'mon, learn from actors like Anthony Hopkins, he is 70 and still does films that kick ass like Fracture. He doesn't go running, fighting or anything like that, in the contrary, he does films that FIT HIS AGE! Anyways, this is just my opinion... 1"

Now Abel will do anything to ruined the couples lives even if it comes to murder.Directed by Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Nurse Betty, The Wicker Man ""2006"") made an highly entertaining movie. Jackson, Wilson and Washington offers first-rate performances. This movie is really an twisted black comedy than an actual thriller. The film is often very funny and tense.

DVD also includes featurettes and deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director. ""Lakeview Terrace"" managed to be an box office hit but it could have been more if Sony marketed this movie right. It received mixed reviews by the film critics but so... in a way, it is matter of personal taste. It's certainly worth an look and it is one of my favorite movies of 2008. Don't miss it.

"Surfer, Dude             ",equazcion,0,comedy,2008,3,"Whoa, dude, it like, totally doesn't exist.This has got to be the slowest and most shallow film I've ever seen. The plot is so thin it's nearly invisible. Once the conflict is set up it's mostly abandoned, and when the resolution comes, it's abrupt and shamelessly contrived. The story is resolved within a span of 5 minutes at the end, and nothing that comes before has any bearing on it. Also, despite the claimed genre of ""comedy"", this only barely qualifies. Aside from a few funny lines here and there, this is really not a funny movie. It doesn't even seem to be intended as such. Perhaps it was supposed to be a ""surfing movie"" instead, which it might have accomplished, if not for the remarkable lack of actual scenes involving people surfing.This is more like a long stoner fantasy. Really, it's like seeing the dream of a passed-out stoner. You can just see one waking up and going, ""Dude, I just had this dream, where I was Matthew McConaughey, only I was like, this famous surfer, and then these corporate dudes were trying to bring me down, but I didn't care and decided to sit on the beach for a couple months."" Or to draw another comparison, it's like listening to an hour and a half of psychedelic music, in that the sober people in the room will be bored, but the stoned people will see all kinds of depth and colors.This seems to have been made by stoners, for stoners. The only reason I can come up with for this getting made is that it was written, greenlit, directed, and in the end only appreciated by people whose minds have been burned out by too much sun and too many drugs. It's so slow and uneventful that you could watch it and follow the story accurately while simultaneously doing your taxes.But hey, maybe I just don't have enough laid-back beach bum in me to appreciate something like this. It was after all a good-looking production, with good acting, lots of hot women in bikinis (and a couple without), and pretty beach scenery. Though again, if, like me, you insist on things like an actual story and interesting events occurring in your movies, you're probably best off skipping this. "
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,howesjf@aol.com,1,misc,2008,1,"This is Hollywood at its worst. A totally unbelievable and predictable piece worthy of any afternoon soap opera. The story is not believable and the characters are flat. Why would the tall good looking British actor go for the short overweight Carmen, when he has the opportunity to date a tall elegant blonde. At a whim all the girls jump onto planes to Greece, never mind the cost.The first Travelling pants movie, while not a masterpiece was infinitely better than this. For the first half the movie jumps around from character to character making it hard to follow ( if you even care by this time). The pants themselves do not even figure much in the plot. Best parts are the Greek scenes and Lena's Greek grandmother. Costas gets accepted at London School of Economics which says a lot for the benefits of the EU"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,0,animation,2009,4,"The qualities: Superb graphics, expressive, beautiful and stylish; Solid characters, both intrinsically and visually; A compelling atmosphere, and mood in general.The flaws: A chaotic script, confusing and unprofessional. They were too ambitious to keep as much as possible of the novel's sub-plots and secondary characters, but didn't know how to organize them according to the screen-writing rules.A linear direction: everything flows on too uniformly, the important scenes are not accented and developed enough. As such, it gradually becomes boring, and during the culminating moments it's positively anticlimactic.The disadvantageous comparison with ""Oblio"". That one had spark!

The House Bunny             ,neil-476,1,comedy,2008,7,"The set-up is simple: airhead bimbo Shelley is conned out of the Playboy mansion for being too old, and ends up as house mother at a sorority house which is due to close because its handful of misfit members are incapable of attracting new members. Fortunately the one thing Shelley is good at is attracting people, so she teaches the girls how to look attractive, and they teach her that there is more to life than appearances.The script tries to have its cake and eat it by making Shelley dumb as a fencepost while, at the same time, being sharp as a tack. This hardly matters, because Anna Faris makes Shelley a character whose attractiveness (as a person) far outweighs her shallowness (she is indeed vapid in the early stages of the film).Some of the early humour doesn't work too well, and there are the usual cultural mistranslations for a British audience which is completely unfamiliar with the whole sorority business, but this doesn't matter either: the generalities work just fine even if some of the specifics don't come across.The message is clear, but not overdone. A lot of the humour is very effective - Faris is a gifted physical comedienne - and this is, in my view, another comedy which succeeds because it has heart. You root for Shelley and the girls because they are inherently decent, nice people, and you hiss the rival sorority (who have designs on taking over the other sorority house) because they have lost sight of the virtues espoused by Shelley and her girls - this, incidentally, gives the movie an unexpected cheer-out-loud moment towards the end).The single use of the F-word is very funn"

The Secret Life of Bees             ,ferguson-6,1,drama,2008,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read Sue Monk Kidd's novel, I was expecting a sappy, soulless, chick flick that would have me rolling my eyes for a couple of hours. Instead, director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball) delivers a very engaging film with a message and some very strong performances.Dakota Fanning plays Lily, who accidentally killed her mother at four, and has since lived with her white trash, redneck despicable father (Paul Bettany). Lily and her nanny Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) runoff to some small town dot on a map thanks to a clue Lily's mom left on one of her few remaining personal items. They arrive at the home/business of August, June and May Boatright (Queen Latifah, Alicia Keys and Sopie Okonedo) who harvest and bottle the best honey in town. What follows is a smörgåsbord of odd family life that slowly gives hope to young Lily.Based in 1964, the film dips its toe into the Civil Rights Act and the ongoing racism of the south, but focuses more on the strength of love and family ... even in a Pepto Bismol home! The performances are all very strong but three standouts are Dakota Fanning, Paul Bettany and Sophie Okonedo.Ms. Fanning is now 14 years old and she delivers a remarkable performance ... and what feels like the first where her screaming skills aren't overused (War of the Worlds, Man on Fire). She strikes me as a young Jodie Foster ... one who has just transitioned from child actor to real actress. I can't wait to see where her career takes her. Mr. Bettany is such a shock here as he typically plays a well dressed, under-spoken Brit (which is what he is in real life!). As a southern redneck whose bitterness rages against the world, he not only pulls it off, but manages to make grits seem even worse than I previously thought. Ms. Okonedo (so amazing in Hotel Rwanda) pulls off the always difficult task of making a ""special"" adult seem very real and vital. A most touching performance from a top notch talent.This is a good story with strong performances, though to take the next step as a film, it needed to dig a little deeper into its wide range of characters and settings. Still, definitely worth seeing."
Untraceable             ,jdesando,1,crime,2008,NA,"""You want the scent? Smell yourself."" Hannibal Lecter If you're longing for Lecter, get some good Chianti and watch Silence of the Lambs for the umpteenth time. The serial killer in the enjoyable Untraceable is not half as interesting as the cunning Hannibal, but then again the real interest is cybercrime, the Internet's ability to draw the world to a site, which if not regulated, can serve snuff as easily as sex.The menace of the Portland, Oregon, police and FBI is a cyber-psycho who tortures his victims on the Web in real time, all of whom die more quickly with each hit to the site. Although brutality is not as explicit as in Saw or Se7en, the film effectively suggests our communal relationship in cyberspace and ultimately our responsibility to restrict the criminal potential, admittedly an extreme case here.Diane Lane plays agent Jennifer Marsh, a sometimes cool, too many times emotional cyber cop, whose initial scene shows her competent in her job. Yet her antagonist proves almost invulnerable to her and the rest of the force. Most of the film is a cat and mouse (electronic this time) game during which the cops almost get him, but not quite.The denouement is a disappointment after the first third's emphasis on the electronic drama; it all devolves into some primitive communication, standard intuition, visual observation, and plain old luck. Marsh's continually emotional response is neither favorable to the women's movement nor objective police work. Or maybe I've just been preconditioned by TV's cool CSI-like investigators.Director Gregory Hoblit's pacing is much better than his direction of Ms. Lane; Anastos Michos's cinematography is spot on for a dreary, menacing Portland. In the absence of Silence of the Lambs and the presence of so much junk at this time of year, Untraceable has the only trace of a ""B"" movie thriller for a while. And don't forget the fava beans."
Iron Man             ,darkmax,0,action,2008,9,"Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.It's well worth its ticket price. 5"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,jemps918,1,drama,2009,7,"Written for the screen and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, The Secret Life of Bees is set in 1964 South Carolina, when the Civil Rights Act was still being enforced and not taken very well in the south, where racism was still at an all-time high. Against this backdrop unfolds a heartwarming, girl-power drama based on Sue Monk Kidd's novel about 14-year old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) who accidentally killed her mother when she was little. Lily runs away from her abusive father T. Ray (Paul Bettany), taking with her their housekeeper Rosaleen Daise (Jennifer Hudson). They find solace in the Pepto-Bismol-hued home of the Boatwright sisters August (Queen Latifah), June (Alicia Keys) and May (Sophie Okonedo).Fanning is now tall and gangly but is still riveting on screen with her amazingly controlled emotional range; she seems to be one of those actors who can do no wrong. Bettany is a surprise, playing a vicious redneck that can still manage to elicit some twisted form of pity from the audience for his lot in life. I was hoping his story could have been fleshed out further. Latifah has come a long way from comedy and veritably anchors her scenes, while Keys transitions wonderfully from musician to movie star playing the beautiful but haughty June. Okonedo played the retarded twin May with great sensitivity and depth.A Hallmark sort of movie with a clear target market, The Secret Life of Bees is a warm and toasty pause from the usual Hollywood fare.

The Ruins             ,zardoz-13,,adventure,2008,1,"The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie ""The Ruins"" is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of ""A Simple Plan,"" adapting his own bestselling novel, sticks steadfastly to the standard clichés and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense, we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore, unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed, ""The Ruins"" provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines. The set-up for ""The Ruins"" resembles the 2006 horror movie ""Turistas"" where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed, ""Turistas"" generated some legitimate thrills and chills. ""The Ruins"" spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. The rest of ""The Ruins"" borrows from another movie: ""The Descent,"" a superb, 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind, too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic ""The Lost Continent"" about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (1961)about a New York florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop.. ""The Ruins"" unfolds in the scenic, sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the ""X-Men"" movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of ""The Covenant""), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of ""Sleepers"") and Amy (Jena Malone of ""Pride & Prejudice""), are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool, but a helpful Teutonic, twentysomething tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson of ""Copying Beethoven"") recovers it, and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party, and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept. First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going, you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left, and they haven't done anything adventurous, our two couples along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend, Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear, you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat. No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted, and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually, the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, ""The Ruins"" turns into ""Bug,"" the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison, it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame. ""The Ruins"" ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it."
The Burning Plain             ,vdoherty,1,misc,2009,2,"It's hard to describe what a complete waste of time this movie is (unless you're watching it to catch a few glimpses of an unclothed Charlize - in which case you're done within the first minute.). No wonder it hasn't hit the big screen - in one word, it's terrible. If you were you were at a theater, you would be demanding your money back. This movie drifts back and forth and back and forth until you're dizzy trying to figure out who does what and when. Without giving it away, I'll just tell you that you'll be quite upset when you reach the worthless ending. We watched this on Direct TV and can tell you that we should have done laundry instead"
Wanted             ,szymonpc@yahoo.com,1,action,2009,8,"I guess this is my first moment I want to comment on the movie. The reason for that is all those negative comments.People don't like the idea of a man making a giant leap across buildings, about the ""plot of the world"" and the ridicule in the movie.But at the same time I guess they DID like Trinity's jump in Matrix, destiny (sadame) in any Japanese movie or comedy of Mr and Mrs Smith.COME ON PEOPLE! This is NOT James Bond, Bourne or Die Hard. This is exactly the opposite. This movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies. It's all a sarcastic view of today's action movies. Just like the bullets - bent to the fullest. For me it's more of an action comedy. The ideas are so stupid that it's funny. Why? Because it was fit in the action movie. I mean come on - the loom, the bullets, the healing stearine, the rats... How can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious? This is not trying to do that. That's why I liked this movie - for its intelligent sarcasm and probably because of all the negative comments from people that expected a ""mature action movie"" and didn't understand the movie. 1"

There aren't too many comedies out there that aren't vulgar or have nudity in them so it was refreshing to see something that was light-hearted and family friendly.

The Duchess             ,jaredmobarak,1,misc,2008,6,"Keira Knightley's period drama for the year 2008 is a well-crafted one, but lacking in anything new and exciting. The Dutchess is your run-of-the-mill tale of unrequited love amidst the artifice of a marriage of utility. It all begins with a gathering of teenagers, playing their games in the yard while the adults talk inside, planning the futures for their children behind closed doors. When Georgiana's mother tells her how she will be the next Duchess of Devonshire, you are almost shocked at her reaction. So happy and excited that a man could love her after only two meetings, she cannot wait to leave and start her new life <U+0085> seemingly forgetting all about that boy in the yard for whom she obviously has feelings for. This is a time of regimented rules, of lives orchestrated for success and not allowed to spontaneously evolve. A decision that I don't think she could have said no to anyways just set up her entire life's journey, one full of happiness, wealth, and eventual heartbreak.I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into the film. I had heard the stuff about how Georgiana was the Empress of Fashion and thought maybe this would tell about her designing sense while also her life. Maybe it was going to be a romance or a tale of deception and intrigue, a behind the scenes look at royalty. Instead of any of those, The Duchess ends up really being just a bio-pic disguised as an historical drama. At times it seems like some interest is about to show face as we learn early on about Her Grace's penchant for politics and desire for all people to be free. It actually seems like we're about to watch her fight for women's rights and equality, but instead the topic is glossed over and she becomes the face of the Whig Party, not a vocal piece to the puzzle. Even the fashion aspect is thrown to the side. The Duke mentions it once and she is introduced at some sort of fashion show later on, but after a funny speech, it is back to the pomp and circumstance of the royal way of life.Whether the film succeeds or not doesn't detract from the fact that the attention to detail is quite nice. Director Saul Dibb has gotten a crew to recreate the time period, actors to inhabit their roles, and an all-around authentic look. I love the moments looking through the windows towards the outside. The glass is fogged and warped as it was back then and the compositions frame the characters of importance with the clear portions, while the others are distorted in the imperfections. Pacing-wise, the film never really drags. It is all composed nicely, spanning the 6-8 years from marriage to the bearing of an heir. The film itself is not boring; it is the story that becomes mediocre and obvious while the cast still intrigues throughout it. Once the relationships and affairs all become public knowledge to the audience, it is just a matter of what will happen next? Unfortunately, that is a question that didn't interest me as much as what could have been looking at different aspects of Georgiana's life, rather than just the marriage itself.Knightley must be given credit for pulling off another turn in a corset, long dress, and numerous wigs. Almost appearing to be a glutton for punishment, she just seems to flock to this type of role. But with good reason, she is solid throughout, showing her youthful exuberance as well as her stubborn disgust at the injustices put upon a woman in that time period. Much smarter than one would expect from a girl sent off to become a Duchess for the sole purpose of conceiving a male heir, Georgiana is a fascinating woman.Her husband is played by the great Ralph Fiennes in a role that I am not used to seeing him in. The Duke of Devonshire is very much an automaton going through life fulfilling his duties. Unless with his beloved dogs, Fiennes gives off a cold dead persona, breathing as little life into the part as possible<U+0097>and that is a compliment, not an insult. He is the kind of guy that just walks away from the group when he is done or bored, he doesn't have to explain himself. Fiennes makes this man sympathetic somehow, showing the audience that beneath the harshness lays a man trapped into a life he cannot leave. He looks out the window at his children and wonders at how free they are. Here is a man in charge of everyone, but alone living for the title. He has an image to uphold and unfortunately that means he must be strict and decisive when it comes to events that could tarnish his reputation and image, events that the Duchess throws his way often.Don't get me wrong, some of the love triangles are interesting to see fleshed out with the wonderful supporting cast, it's just that I wish there was more weight to the story with those moments only complementing. Dominic Cooper's Charles Grey, the boy from Georgiana's childhood, adds a layer with the inevitable affair, and the character of Bess Foster, played by Hayley Atwell, is perhaps the most interesting of them all. At first the Duchess' best friend, she becomes her husband's mistress and lover as well, creating a dynamic unused to in films like this. The three live together, all for their own needs. One for his title and heir, one for the power to have her children returned to her, and the other, trapped in her life now, to have some semblance of meaning. It's definitely the most off-the-wall aspect of the story, but unfortunately not enough to make The Duchess any more special than the next period drama to come, or the last before it."
Nim's Island             ,DarkVulcan29,1,adventure,2008,9,"Abigail Breslin is one amazing performer, she seems to light up the screen with her presents, even if the movie is a flop, she somehow makes it memorable. But this movie is no flop, it had everything you would love, adventure, humor, and memorable characters. It is nice to see Jodie Foster doing comedy again, which she has not done for a while, not since The Brave One, FlightPlan, and The Inside Man to name a few. And Gerard Butler is also memorable in duel roles as Nim's father and the imaginary hero Alex Rover.The story begins with an 11 year old girl named Nim(Abigail Breslin) who lives on a beautiful Island with her scientist father(Gerard Butler). They both seem to live a happy and simply life. Nim also has her animal friends on the island. But when her father goes off in his boat for research, but a bad storm sets him in the middle of nowhere. Nim becomes frightened and emails her favorite author Alex Rover for help. Nim thinks that Alex Rover is an adventurer, like the books he is named after. But lines are blurred between fact and fiction, cause Alex Rover(funny performance by Jodie Foster) is a female novelist, with no knack for adventure, who in fact is a borderline agoraphobia. Who can't even venture out into her mail box. But Alex is willing to try to overcome this, in order to help Nim out, but will she help her before it's too late?

The Dark Knight             ,springsunnywinter,0,action,2008,10,"Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen. 998"
Frost/Nixon             ,ElMaruecan82,0,misc,2015,9,"There's a brief but memorable moment in ""Frost/Nixon"" where one of Nixon's most ardent haters, a researcher played by Sam Rockwell, is about to confront for the first time the man he holds responsible for the destruction of American ideals. This is his time to shine and honor his opinions by not shaking the 'Shakers' hand. Yet, despite a brief hesitation, he gives both hand and respect. That says it all, there's the politician, there's the man, and one of the greatest tricks a corrupt one ever pulls is to hide behind the mask of friendliness.No one can resist it, much less a TV audience. In my student's essay about the power of media -which is the film's essential theme- I wrote that the camera not only changes perceptions but actions too. As long as there is an instance of mediation between two people, something will cease to be natural, and the talent of those who control the media is to make it imperceptible. So, when Frost (Michael Sheen) decides to interview Nixon, with his own money because no American channel will accept to pay a British interviewer, he gives the fallen President a golden opportunity to talk to American people. Nixon (Frank Langella) advised by Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) accepts the challenge, a TV show will reach the people quicker and simpler than a memoirs book.It all comes to this : either Nixon shows a new shining image three years after the Watergate and his disastrous resignation, the only one in History, or Frost confronts a man to his responsibilities and forces him to admit his guilt. That's what Frost's partner John Birt (Matthew McFayden), Bob Zelnick, a TV journalist (Oliver Platt) and James Reston, Jr. (Rockwell) expect from the interview, anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges, the premises could be that of a boxing match. And ""Frost/Nixon"" is indeed a duel (the slash is relevant) with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos, starting with Frost, a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows, the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.But Nixon plays in another league, being the epitome of 'unpopular culture', a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams, including his own. In 1995, Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon, with no concession. Still, we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now, I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself, ambivalent to the best, with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'larger-than-life' President. Anyway, he's not an amateur and during the interview, he's like Goliath ready to frost David.Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable right-hand man (Kevin Bacon) who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV, he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960, so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview (we might as well call it a round) starts, Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate ""why didn't you burn the files?"" Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut, Frost was literally knocked down, tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers, we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment, before he could recover.The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win, yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a dead-end and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome, and by throwing himself in that crazy project, Frost lost his show, 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career, maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend, Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks, she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview, destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed, the two men bet a lot in this interview, and it's like two destinies crossing one another.The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon, one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process, on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots, or use his adversary's weapons against him, not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once, the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close, yet so different from each other.It is between the two men and the others are only spectators, filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match, and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men, and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes, truth hurts, but how relieving it can also b"
Surveillance             ,whitcom-1,1,crime,2008,8,"A good thriller is my favorite genre and I was hooked into this film within the first few seconds and stayed involved for the entire ride. It kept me guessing throughout. The contrast between eerie cop shop and stark, beautiful prairies is a stylish treat for the eyes. The performances are believable and compelling. Well cast, without exception. The little girl is surprisingly good. Her even performance made me wonder about what had happened to her and drew me into the story. When she wasn't on screen, I worried about her safety. The ending is a clever, eerie choice. I was taken completely by surprise and I usually predict a telegraphed ending a mile away. In this case, any other choice would be a cop-out (pardon the pun). I was glad that the director resisted the temptation for a blood-fest. It could have gone much further in that vein. Instead the tension relied upon intelligent visual storytelling. Kudos to everyone involved. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. 1"
Wendy and Lucy             ,ferguson-6,1,drama,2009,6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Absolutely stunning performance from the beautiful Michelle Williams, who somehow doesn't look beautiful here and is very believable as the on-the-road loner in search of salvation at a cannery in Alaska. What doesn't work is everything else.I understand the minimalist approach, but this story doesn't differ much from if you asked a junior high student to write a story about running away from home with her dog. Sure the serpentine belt wouldn't get mentioned, but losing the dog, even if only momentarily, would probably be a sub-plot.Don't misunderstand. It is a very well shot film and realistic to the point of dread, but we are never really provided any reason to care about Wendy or Lucy ... other than basic human caring.Will Patton adds a nice, but brief, touch as the auto mechanic and Wally Dalton somehow captured my interest more than Wendy. For the full impact, you have to know that Wally Dalton plays a Walgreens security guard who stares at the parking lot for 12 hours a day.Michelle Williams deserves the kudos for her performance, but I believe the film itself is much overrated."
Space Chimps             ,fabulousrice,,animation,2010,1,"This film ranks among the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life. Not a single joke was funny, not a single image of the film nice to look at or worth remembering. The last minutes of the film, where the ""bad guys"" of the film are present the most, were almost unwatchable considering the awful designs of the creatures, and the absence of wit and ideas in the plot. I had the feeling I was watching a badly designed video game whose graphics are below average. At times watching it felt like torture for me and if I hadn't had a principle of never walking out on a film I would have left the theater. Simply put, it is one of the worst and ugliest films I have seen"
Flash of Genius             ,Radio_Lady,0,misc,2008,9,"There's an old expression that states, ""It's not the money, it's the principle of the thing."" Robert Kearns fought for that ideal for more than three decades of his life.""Flash of Genius"" <U+0096> presumably an expression inventors use to explain the moment of genesis of an idea <U+0096> is the true story of Detroit engineer and inventor Bob Kearns. On his wedding night, he had an unfortunate accident. He was removing the cork from a bottle of celebratory champagne. The cork flew up and hit him in his left eye. The resultant scene was bloody but somehow prophetic <U+0096> Bob Kearns came out of that incident legally blind in one eye.His marriage survived and the man went on to father six children. Meanwhile, Kearns was keenly sensitive to the workings of the human eye. Kearns observed the pattern of the blink and he had a fascinating revelation. Kearns postulated that our brains introduce a discontinuous pattern whenever the eyes blink <U+0096> quickening and slowing as necessary.While driving in the Michigan rain, he observed that the windshield wipers on vehicles of that era only had two positions: ON and OFF. Quite often, the wipers ran too swiftly for light rainfalls, and too slowly for downpours.Their marriage was affected deeply by his tinkering and the aftermath of the invention process. It was a single-minded effort that eventually took over Kearns' entire life. At one point, it brought him to the edge of madness. Kearns swept aside his involvement with his loving wife, Phyllis, and his six young children as he became more and more obsessed with designing and marketing a windshield wiper that paused during its sweeping motion, as the eye pauses during blinking. By rearranging the already-existing mechanical and electrical circuitry, Kearns invented and patented the ""Blinking Eye"" windshield wiper. His goal was to manufacture these wipers and sell them to the automotive companies.At the time, the behemoth Ford Motor Company engineers had already begun their own investigations into concocting an intermittent wiper system. Kearns was invited to show off his invention and given a Ford car on which to install it. Initially, the game plan appeared to be that a Kearns family business would indeed be born and Kearns would realize his dream.That, however, was not to be. This movie documents what followed when the Ford Motor Company suddenly quashed its deal with Kearns, and surreptitiously began installing its own version of the intermittent wiper. What follows is the courageous but truly demented tale of how Kearns' was left with a single life purpose -- to get the Ford Motor Company to acknowledge they stole his idea <U+0096> his greatest work. It may only have been a windshield wiper system to others, but to him, it was a work of art on par with the ""Mona Lisa.""First-time director and former producer Marc Abraham read the original story by John Seabrook in the New Yorker magazine and decided to make it into a movie. A script by Phillip Railsback followed. Eventually, actor Greg Kinnear received a copy with the unlikely working title of ""Window Washer Man."" Kinnear quipped on TV last week that the property sat on his desk for months while he avoided reading it, thinking it would involve some kind of a caped superhero with a squeegee!I thought the movie was profound but some moviegoers might also find it quite grim. Anyone who has had dealings with large corporations knows the scope of their unyielding grasp <U+0096> you just have to look at modern companies and trace their history. Some have met their demise because of poor decisions. However, I don't believe it is ""bad karma"" that finds the large automakers in difficult straits these days.My impression is that Greg Kinnear has never had a better part and I honestly hope he will be noticed for it. He has already won the Best Actor Award at Boston's Film Festival. Actress Lauren Graham plays Kearns' long-suffering wife Phyllis, and Dermot Mulroney (with a mane of dark hair over his forehead) is fine as a duplicitous and self-serving partner named Gil Privick. Alan Alda has a small but significant role as Kearns' lawyer Gregory Lawson. The various young actors who play Kearns' children at different ages were quite natural and believable.Hamilton, Ontario, Canada stands in for Detroit, Michigan in this film. Visiting family members from the Detroit area told me there is a lot of recent film activity in Michigan. Unfortunately, this movie was apparently not part of a trend that is said to be bringing films back to US locations. As a reviewer, I support that completely.I give this movie a ""B+"" on Ellen's Entertainment Report Card.Universal Pictures Official Website: http://www.flashofgenius.net/MPAA: Rated PG-13 for brief strong language.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,halodarkly,0,animation,2008,7,"I went to see ""The Clone Wars"" with carefully measured expectations, given the very, very mixed critical reaction. Although I say ""critical"", it's always best to remember that angry nerds with broadband are not film critics. But even the venerable and generally even-handed Roger Ebert didn't have much good to say about it.After the strange feeling of seeing the ""Warner Bros"" logo and hearing ""As Time Goes By"" in place of the Fox logo and fanfare, the film gets off to an inauspicious start - a rendition of John Williams' Star Wars Main Theme played by The London Philharmonic's cheapest non-union Mexican equivalent. And instead of the opening crawl, we get a montage and voice-over in a 1930s serial style. This will probably work well in the TV series, and there's nothing wrong with it, but seems strangely out of place in the cinema. This may be just because the traditional Star Wars crawl is so ingrained in film-goers minds, but it was an undeniable jolt. But from that point forward it gets better.Visually it's like nothing I've ever seen - instead of the style of CGI animation that we're now used to, the characters are made to look something like hand-painted wooden puppets. In a close-up shot you can actually see the brush strokes where the clone troopers have been ""painted."" It's a brave creative decision, given that Pixar, Dreamworks and others have had such great success with the more traditional style of CG animation, to take such a different direction. After I became accustomed to it, I really liked it. The animation has good ""weight"" to it - nothing ever suffers from the disconnected CGI unreality that often plagues the digital effects in live-action films (including 2002's ""Attack of the Clones""). The environments are amazingly well realised, including a hand-painted sky which conjures up a nice balance between traditional and CG animation.Sonically, it's Star Wars all the way. All the classic sounds are there (lightsabers, blasters, walkers and so on) and are well orchestrated to the action. Musically, they've gone some way to doing what I had hoped they might - using John Williams' themes, but taken in a new direction. There's a much more pronounced world music feel, and I really enjoyed that. When the score moves to a full orchestral piece, it sometimes falls a little flat. But it certainly serves its purpose, with only the main theme pulling me out of the moment.Plot-wise... well, it's Star Wars. There's a MacGuffin that must be found and returned to gain a tactical advantage in the war. Any further discussion of the plot would probably be wasted... and not just to avoid spoilers - it's all about the action. So... is there action? Oh, yes. Quite a lot of it. Too much, in fact. As a TV series in 30 minute installments, it should be amazing. But welded into one feature-length adventure, it's a bit overpowering. The visual inventiveness helps hold interest as yet another battle unfolds, but the fact that it's essentially 3 or 4 episodes joined together does show. Not enough to make it a bad film... but when the end comes it *seems* to be an anti-climax purely because there's been no let-up for the previous 30 minutes. As such, the end seems to arrive very suddenly. Had it been structured a little more like a feature, it might have managed a better finale. But, taken on its own merits, the action is very well realised.The new, kid-oriented character of Ahsoka is not particularly annoying - and that's about as much as you can ask from the this sort of character. Aged above 15, I'm not the target audience for Ahsoka's rite of passage story. Jabba's son is virtually inanimate... barely a character at all. Jabba the Hutt's uncle Ziro is bizarre - a sort of tattooed, New Orleans drag queen in huge slug form - but neither particularly annoying nor offensive as some reviewers have claimed. A kind of Vivien Leigh-as-Blanch DuBois (or maybe Truman Capote) to the Sydney Greenstreet-inspired Jabba.Overall, this is a good, fun animated adventure with excellent action sequences, that works well despite some pacing issues. It deserves credit for developing its own unique visual style, and daring to take liberties with a well-established franchise. In the end, its this willingness to challenge that much-loved formula that will provoke the ire of many a middle-aged Star Wars fan, as they clutch their Millennium Falcon scale replicas to their portly man-bosoms. But it may find more favour with the newer generation of fan who have less attachment to the memory of what they think they saw in a cinema, and a childhood, a long, long time ago."
The Reader             ,The_Film_Addict,1,drama,2009,10,"There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.After a six year celluloid dry spell, Stephen Daldry returns to the director's chair in a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. It's superbly crafted.With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Deep within Heidelberg, Germany, Michael (David Kross), a young pubescent teenager haven fallen ill, is comforted by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a hard working woman who is twice his age. Taken by her generosity, Michael revisits Hanna to offer his gratitude. What begins as an awkward reunion escalates into a seductive, forbidden affair that intensifies when Michael begins reading to the distant, empty Hanna, who is deeply awakened by Michael's spoken literature. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. Nearly a decade later, unable to forget his passionate summer while studying law, he attends a Nazi trail, and to his dismay, hears Hanna's distant voice.""The Reader"" is a complex film; maybe a little too complex for some. Though the film pertains to Nazism and the ""sins of our fathers,"" in essence, ""The Reader"" is a film that reflects the emotions inside all of us. During a lecture, Michael's professor comments, ""Societies like to think they operate on morality but they don't."" In this cynical age, how far from reality is that statement? During Hanna's trial, she's questioned why she participated in the Nazi party's horrendous war crimes, broken she replies, ""It was my job."" Oddly enough, that seems to be the justification most people use. Surprisingly, though, ""The Reader"" isn't about her exposure as a war criminal, but an exposure on an individual who took the wrong path. She's not a bad person; she's simply made wrong choices. However, when it comes to having involvement in the Nazi's liquidation of the Jews, how ""wrong"" can you get? ""You ask us to think like lawyers,"" cries on student, ""what are we trying to do?"" A distraught Michael replies, ""We are trying to understand!"" But, just who exactly is trying to grasp a deeper understanding: the court or Michael? How can Hanna's past be forgiven? Director Stephen Daldry brings the much needed emotional layer that a character such as Hanna Schmitz desperately needs. Although her actions are beyond unforgivable, strangely, we sympathize with her. Maybe it's her other shameful secret. Maybe it's superb character development.""The Reader"" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances. In one of her finest hours, Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime. It's a haunting and heart-breaking. David Kross, who's only 18, is impressive as the teenager with raging hormones; it's such a daring performance. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. Completing the role of Michael, as the tortured grown man, is Ralph Fiennes, who balances Michael's despair through his melancholic emotion when he encounters a grown Jewish woman, played by Lena Olin, who was also at Hanna's trail. Although her scenes clock in less than 10 minutes, Olin, too, is breathtaking.When ""The Reader's"" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I had witnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grown Michael asks Hanna, ""Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"" Heartbroken, she replies, ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead."" She's right. 4"
The Burning Plain             ,barrys82,1,misc,2011,7,"The Burning Plain, a romantic mystery about a woman on the edge who takes an emotional journey back to the defining moment of her life. Written and directed by Guillermo Arriaga (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel). It is a heart breaking, touching movie. It follows the formula of having a main story with various sub-stories that in the end their paths are crossed. The rhythm is a little slow, it continuously changes from story to story making it hard to follow and a little boring at some moments. The cast is good. Charliza Theron, Kim Basinger John Corbett, Robin Tunney, Jose Maria Yazpik, everyone delivering very convincing performances although some of them are a little overacted as well. In conclusion, If you've seen Babel or 21 Grams or Amores Perros, all of them written by Ariaga, then you know what to expect with The Burning Pla"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,Norway1,0,animation,2008,7,"I took my kids, ages 6, 9 and 11 to see this. With that in mind, here's my take, based on their reaction and my own experience.My background is: I saw SW on the big screen back in 1977 and have been a fan ever since. Today I am a member of the Star Wars fan club (Hyperspace, on sw official site) and follow along with SW news, buy the video games and novels, and have a VAST collection of the toys (invested over $5,000 I'm sure - but hey, I have kids!). So I suppose you could say I am a ""fanboy"" or at the very least a more than average fan. :) I knew this was being made for television - NOT for the big screen - and thus viewed it as a pilot for a ""made for kids"" (Nick or CN) television series. With the budget and baggage that implies.With that background, and thanks to some scathing reviews (AICN Harry, CHUD, etc.) my expectations were phenomenally low before entering the theater. (Basically, I was just watching this for the kids' sake because they were begging me to take them.) Verdict: It was actually pretty good! Yes, there were parts that sucked, there were even a few things I hated (just like there were in the prequels and ROTJ), but for the most part, I was very impressed and even blown away by the shear scope of this made-for-TV movie! I couldn't believe the quality (again, for a TV-show). It was funny, exciting, even engaging at times. And considering the budget and target audience, it was really very good.Here's what didn't work for me:1) As much as I tried, I really didn't like the new teen-padawan, Ahsoka. She was annoying and imo inconsistent with the established rules for Jedi: They are always (Anakin being the sole exception) enlisted as infants or toddlers. They grow up being indoctrinated by Jedi teachings. They learn respect, humility, patience, etc as ""younglings"" long before being assigned to a Master. Thus Ahsoka's rebellious high-school attitude is very much askew.2) The bantering may have been OK, but the pathetic (American High-School style) nicknames got old REAL fast. Not one single time did Ahsoka call Anakin by his real name (Skywalker or even Anakin). It was always ""Sky Guy"" - complete disrespect! I can't recall one single time Anakin referred to Ahsoka by her name either (though a friend of mine disagrees), he was always calling her ""Snips""! WTF? And the final straw was them both constantly referring to Jabba's son as ""Stinky"". All. The. Time. (Just thinking of it raises my blood pressure.)That's pretty much what I hated. There were some other very minor annoyances, but easily forgotten in the big picture. Now, here's what really worked:1) Beautiful animation. I dig the style. I've read lots of reviews that diss on the animation and even on the style. While I agree that the characters look like they've been chiseled out of wood and hand-painted, I really liked it. Yes, the quality is no where near as good as Pixar or Dreamworks, (and close-up shots look more like a video game cut scene than a movie,) but this was MADE FOR TELEVISION! The budget was probably about a tenth what any Pixar film costs to make. So put it in perspective and appreciate what they can do with such a low budget! It would be more fair to compare it to an episode of Jimmy Neutron (not the movie, the TV show). If you still think it sucks, then at least you are making a valid comparison. It's not Shrek 2 or The Incredibles. It's Hoodwinked.2) The music! So many have complained that ""This is not John Williams"" but why does that have to be a bad thing? Williams' music was respected, and even used in the opening and closing sequences, plus a few times between. The music was GREAT! It was engaging and beautiful, and at times had me wanting to hear the rest of the song! Seriously, I can't imagine it being any better. It baffles my mind that people can complain about it. Really. I don't get it.3) The Clones. We see clones as Imperial (um, I mean Republic) officers, wearing the green officer garb (woo hoo!), and the ground troops showing ways of making themselves unique (mostly by tattoos and haircuts). It's just as it should be and makes them more human and real.4) The humor (overall)! I laughed my eyes dry every time a droid had any dialog. I didn't much like the slapstick humor in the films, but as a cartoon it fits a lot better. Like when two clones are surrounded by an army of battle droids: Droid: ""Surrender"" Clone: ""But we have you outnumbered."" (Droid looks around, ""What?"" (counts droids) ""One, two.."" And then out of the sky comes two clone ships filled with men, blowing the droids away ""Kaboom!"" And when a droid is looking over a cliff through binoculars to see the approaching clones, but loses his balance and falls down the cliff. His droid commander says, ""Come back here, soldier!"" Very funny stuff! Yes, it's ""kiddie humor"" but it works here and got me laughing.In addition, the story was engaging for a TV cartoon. Compare it to a throw-away episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender (my fave kid-TV show by far) and it stands up pretty well. Remember ""The great divide"", ""The Fortuneteller"", ""Avatar Day"", ""The Beach"", ""The Ember Island Players"", etc. etc.For a TV show, I would rate this 8 out of 10, but for a ""movie"" only 6 out of 10. And since it's kind of both, I give it a 7.I can't wait to see more of this series on TV! But hope Ahsoka dies a long and painful death. :)"
A Christmas Tale             ,hasosch,1,comedy,2009,10,"When the Vuillard family comes back from church, on Christmas eve's day, they suddenly realize that Simon the painter is missing. Father Vuillard suggests that his children go to search him, because he has an inclination to drink and gets easily into fights. Since Ivan's wife does not want to go, his former lover Elizabeth goes. Driven by a woman's infallible instinct, she finds Simon immediately in one of those rare bars that are open at that time in Paris, the owner and the guests being mainly Muslims for whom there is no reason to close up during the Christian holidays. And now there comes one of the most wonderful scenes between man and woman in the history of movies: He has already ""piccolé"" as the French say (is pretty intoxicated) when Elizabeth sits to him at the bar. Simon is just going to order another beer with ""side-kick"" (probably Wodka), and Elisabeth says first: Do you not think you had already enough for today? - He answers: This is none of your business. There she responds: Well, I am feeling in the same mood as you do and therefore drink the same as you drink. So, there are sitting until almost 4 o' clock in the morning in the little bar and are drinking beer and Wodka, having wonderful discussions because soon, they are on the same ""level"", and, on top of all, they are even going to get reconciled letting passing revue what went wrong in their common past, and we hear out of Simon's, and soon also out of Elisabeth's mouth some of the most astonishing confessions that they would probably never have been able to utter in any other environment (there is a joke in French between ""s'enivrer"" = getting drunk and ""environment"").In Douglas Sirk's ""Written on the wind"", there is a similar scene between Robert Stack and Lauren Bacall. Robert escapes a family ceremony and goes boozing in his favorite restaurant, Lauren follows him. But unlike the scene in Desplechin's movie, the confrontation between the two marks only the definite end in their mutual understanding. Rainer Werner Fassbinder, in a book-fragment on Sirk's work, wrote: ""Robert starts again to drink. Now, it shows that Lauren Bacall has no solutions for her husband. Instead of going to booze together with him, instead of trying to understand some bits of his grief, she gets more and more pure and causes one more and more to throw up"" (translated by the present author from: R.W. Fassbinder, Filme Befreien Den Kopf. Frankfurt am Main 1984, p. 16).Another wonderful example of women-power happens between Faunia (Emmanuelle Devos) and Henry (Mathieu Amalric) who plays her lover. Henry, being a drinker, lets himself provoke to analyze the miserable situation of their dysfunctional family in an extremely theatric way attacking directly the husband of one of his sisters who sits besides him. After he is knocked down by this husband and lies on the soil, Faunia seems to be amused by not startled at all about this situation. When he gets on his feet again he throws her his car-keys on the table and says that she has come in the wrong moment to meet his family and that he wants her to ""scram"". But she sets up one of her absolutely disarming smiles, shoots him with a short but highly intellectual comment and asks him if this would not be nice of him to bring her now a coffee. Henry's face looks like a tank was driven over it.Arnaud Desplechin's movies are as far away from everything that is produced by or imitated from Hollywood as they can be. They are symphonies of style where the rhythm seems to tell the different interwoven stories rather than they are connected by an inner succession. This film consists practically exclusively of a super-all-star cast of the most famous still living French actors. A true highlight"
Pathology             ,Jawnny,1,crime,2008,1,"Usually, i'm not into making comments about movies but with this one i will an exception. In the beginning i was like ""Hey man, this could really be a good movie"" A group of pathology students with some nasty thoughts! Let's see where this is going! Well, what i was about to witness was something REALLY bad and PREDICTABLE. In the scene where Gallo says to Ted to show up that we wouldn't want to miss that one, i thought, ""oh well that Juliette girl is gonna be dead that's fore sure!"", well it happened. On the next scene where the all thing blew up, i thought ""well this couldn't end like this, that Gallo boy is gonna live and kill Ted's girlfriend!"" and what happened? Well the Dr. Gallo did that. On the last scene i was like ""Ohhhh, how about now? don't tell me Gallo is gonna show up and talk about his killing and that Ted's friend, that shy boy is gonna help him killing him!"" Well once again, for my worse expectations... that happened again. This is the MOST PREDICTABLE movie i have ever saw. This is really terrible. My advice? Stay away from this movie and save some one hour and a half of your life."
What Happens in Vegas             ,jackmuley,1,comedy,2008,7,"I know what you're thinking-- this is too high of a score. And I would have agreed with you. That is, until I actually saw this movie.I had no desire whatsoever to see this movie, and when the reviews came in that the ship was sinking, there was no convincing me otherwise. Then it came to the dollar theater and my wife pleaded. Her reasoning was that even if it's awful it's only a dollar, right? So I resentfully went along with some friends of ours. Surprisingly, half-way through the movie, I'm not annoyed with it. In fact, despite every urge to call it crap based on pre-judgments, I find myself laughing out loud. It wasn't a fluke either. Our whole theater was laughing. Because it's a funny movie.It was a good comedy-- no question. Usually I can't stand Cameron Diaz, but she seemed fine to me. Ashton Kutcher was his usual stupid yet charismatic self, and Rob Corddry was the highlight for me. Every single time he got on screen I was guaranteed a laugh.So for those of you looking for a comedy that is actually funny, look no farther. This movie just fell victim to being rated on the same scale as the Godfather, when people should really rank it from 1-10 based on what they expect from a comedy.Wishing I could-- 7.5 out of "
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,markmorgan,0,animation,2008,5,"If you expect Madagascar 2 to be as mild mannered as the prequel then you will be very disappointed. If you think that you wouldn't mind jokes about an old granny being beat up in front of your kids, and you liked the first Madagascar, then you will probably like the sequel. The PG rating is 100% required as on the way home we had to explain to our 7-year-old son, it is never acceptable to beat up an old lady no matter how annoying they are (warning: some scenes were shocking and violently graphic for impressionable or young kids!) The first Madagascar is much more appropriate for children, hence its U rating. To make matters worse, the irritating King Julian is, unfortunately, back in abundance. There were some mildly amusing moments - for example the reference to The Twilight Zone when Mort was on the wing - and some of the slap-stick wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, many of the gags were quite predictable e.g. the one involving Marti, zebras and spit! Comments were quite negative as we walked out of the cinema with one guy saying that he fell asleep part of the way through! At one point my wife was so despondent she wanted to walk out of the cinema, however having paid the money we felt obliged to sit through it. The plot was a bit like 'Lion King' on drugs and didn't seem to flow that well! It's certainly not a wow factor film, most intelligent adults and kids would find better entertainment watching a fish tank! You might just about manage to keep the kids in their seats with this film but don't listen to the advertising hype because it's nothing to write home about!"
Death Race             ,tubby1,0,action,2009,3,"Jason 'one-dimensional' Statham appears in another film of brainless action and mind-numbing car races. The script is cheap recycled material, which exploits the unimaginative crash-bang-wallop of the film.The films key audience is the young-gamer, gizmo's generation. The film is created as a fast-paced action computer game hoping lots of crashes, burning cars and weaponry will entice. For the majority Death Race is way too brash, ugly and destructive to appeal, indeed the car scenes are messily edited and repeated.If the stereotypical and annoying characters are not enough to halt proceedings the endless one-liners should do the trick. This is where I can give Statham credit, he does have the ability to churn out cheesy and ill-opportune 'one-liners' with an ounce of believability and authority, which his co-cast cannot do.Death Race is unashamedly one-dimensional and the idea that placing a few guns on tops of cars will appeal and make this an engaging film is hard to fathom. However, nowadays if you want to make money throw in some cars, guns, girls and booming hip-hop and you seem to generate an odd following."
The House Bunny             ,jaywensley2004,1,comedy,2014,9,"""The House Bunny"" owes a lot to several movies of the ""naive wins out"" type. The best of these is ""Being There,"" the least is ""Dumb and Dumber."" The main character is guileless and often childlike, but not stupid. Anna Faris as ""The House Bunny"" portrays my favorite variation on this theme...the trusting romantic who lives simply but understands complicated. And she does so very, very well.Faris is a natural in this type of role, her particular form of charisma is of the wide-eyed woman/child. If you've ever seen a Marion Davies' movie, you've seen the origin of this character. Alyson Hannigan did a brilliant turn on this role as Michelle Flaherty in ""American Pie"". And Anna Faris' Shelly Darlingson is another great interpretation of the type. Shelly is all about rainbows and unicorns, but she understands thunderstorms and glue factories, and Faris makes the existence and success of Shelly believable. That said, the main plot of ""The House Bunny"" is outrageously unbelievable. But its ""that kind"" of comedy, hyperbolic and over-the-top. I would never recommend this movie for its depth of story, but Faris' performance, with the bonus of early Emma Stone, makes ""The House Bunny"" a movie that delivers smiles and cheer"
Street Kings             ,atifrahman,,misc,2008,9,"Here's another movie the critics dismissed that turned out to be a great movie. I was initially hesitant to go see the movie because of the negative reviews, but went to see Forrest Whittaker, Hugh Laurie and Keanu Reeves. I think most critics can't look at Reeves and not see Bill Preston Esq or Neo. However Keanu Reeves shows range in the movie and heads up the movie wonderfully.This movie is a fast-paced LA Cop movie. It starts off great and never slows down. Money well spent at the Theater, and I'm the kind of guy who'd walk out of a movie that does not engage me. I would watch it again. 3"
Iron Man             ,sacflyzone,0,action,2008,10,"Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film. 6"
Yes Man             ,bbSouthstreet,0,comedy,2008,8,"I am the biggest Jim Carrey fan I know, whenever a Jim Carrey movie comes out in theaters, I have to see it no matter how bad the premise sounds. I was there for his worse (Fun with Dick and Jane) and I was there for his best (Horton Hears a Who, The Number 23 and Bruce Almighty). As far as this new Jim Carrey venture goes, this is one of his best.Besides Jim Carrey, the movie has a good deal to offer. We have Zooey Deschannel, beautiful and talented, singing new age music in the fictitious band ""Munchausen by Proxy."" Zooey was perfect for this movie because the crew could've had someone lame like Maggie Gyllenhaal or Cameron Diaz play in this. Zooey is really one of those new actresses who is daring and free spirited in her roles, thank God she starred in ELF and got noticed.Okay, now on to the story. A lot of people say that this is too like ""Liar Liar."" Now I have to disagree and agree, it's a little similar with ""Liar Liar"" but not too much similar. The story, I find, is more realistic than Liar, as it gives a story we can relate to. I'm sure a lot of us are still brooding over that boyfriend/girlfriend we broke up with, and we just become zombie's after that, avoiding anything fun or exciting. The movie offers a good point, if you don't feel like going back to your old life, try a new and exciting life. The plot is kinda simple, but that's what comedy is about, being simple and taking a break from the serious plots like ""The Departed"" or ""The Dark Knight."" So when going to the movies and asked if you'd want to go see ""Yes Man,"" there is only only answer for that. Guess what it is."
Good Dick             ,arooby,1,misc,2009,9,"I just gonna say that i have not written a comment before..i just liked to read about the titles i had an interest for...This movie made me write a comment! It was totally weird, simple but also meaningful. The story is about a girl that has get isolated to her house because she is afraid to be socialized for her own reasons(i am not gonna reveal) till a guy working on a video club shows a sudden interest on her and tries to get her off her miserable but also ""charming"" life.The movie achieves its target having a very interesting plot and emotional at the same time...It has to be said that both of the main actors play really well and give a realistic view of the life where not all the things are like a fairy tale.If u wanna watch a movie sexy,emotional and weird this is ur movie!"
Street Kings             ,sagans_moon,,misc,2010,10,"This is a real find - one of those sneaky films that slipped through the box office and past the critics, despite being a great movie. I'm sure it will find it's audience though, because it's class all the way.Keanu puts in one of his best performances and seems to be only improving with age. I know he cops a lot of flack for his performances at times but understated doesn't always mean wooden. He is capable of great subtlety, if you care to pay attention. If the guy looked like Sean Penn instead of Keanu Reeves, I'm sure he would get more credit than he does. The support cast are superb. Hugh Laurie is particularly noteworthy, laying on the smarm.Gritty, compelling and gutsy. If you yearn for a return to the hard-edged cop movie, don't miss this hidden treasure."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,cowboysfan816,1,drama,2008,1,"I went to see this movie tonight and you would think with all the movie stars in this movie, that it would have been a hit. It was a strikeout to me... It took forever between scenes, it was like watching two snails roll in dirt. Keys was not believable in her role and Hudson was no Ella. Her smart remarks got a few giggles, but her acting was very weak. Lily of cousre did well in her parts. you sure can tell real actors from people who are famous and just want a role in the movie. Queen seemed to try and act older due to the womens age of course, but all she did was talk slow like she was trying to hard.Her words of wisdom was so slow and apart in the lines that you knew were she was going with it before she finished. This movie should have been a Sunday night movie are something on PBS. The plot was to far apart to really make someone want to get into this movie. I found myself looking and waiting to see if it was going to get better and it never did. This movie is like looking at a guy or gal and thinking wow their nice looking, have a good job and appears to be so kind. But, when you finally find the nerve to go up to them... their breath stinks. It kinda throws you off guard at first, so you try and over look it, but the more you turn your head to look the other way...the more they turn towards you even closer...yeah, thats how the movie is. The only think I enjoyed was my popcorn and nachos..."
"Surfer, Dude             ",Quinoa1984,0,comedy,2009,5,"I rarely do this, and I either feel vindicated or embarrassed doing it, but I went into Surfer, Dude prepared to not like it at all. Matter of fact, I rented the movie (from my library on a 25 cent charge) with the intent to have a good laugh at it, and maybe get in with my wife on a Mystery Science Theater 3000 style poke-and-jab job. As it turned out, by the near of the end of its slim 82 minute running time, we felt the same way: it's not hate-worthy. It's simply too filled with well-intentions to simply stomp and kick the crap out of. While one can argue a lot of misplaced ego-trips go that way (i.e. M. Night Shyamalan) I didn't really sense hubris or too much faulty technical craft going on.It's simply what it appears to be: a bunch of surfer dudes, and I include in that group the filmmakers and McConaughey, got together after many years of prep (you read that right, many years, like seven according to the DVD making-of) and made a movie for themselves, and the California surfer community. Indeed there's been a minor cult that has risen in California around the movie; screenings spring up with masses of dirty and stoned surfers trudging into the theater ready to soak up the waves. At least, that's my assumption having never been to the California surfing community nor a surfer's cult movie screening. I can't help but wonder if it was for the 'plot' or the 'comedy'.So why isn't the movie hateful? For one thing, for all of his incessant I-don't-need-to-wear-a-shirt-ness, McConaughey is a likable guy as Steve, a guy who has a craving for a wave, all the time, every time it's possible. There is not much conflict to speak of except this: either Steve rides the wave, or he doesn't, and for much of Surfer, Dude he actually doesn't ride waves but rather try and fend off a corporate leech that wants to sign him up for a reality TV show gig. That's basically the whole movie. Oh, and Willie Nelson shows up as a goat farmer who smokes lots of doobs (of course), and Woody Harrelson pops up from time to time as a, uh, manager of sorts who smokes a lot of doobs (of course) and is sometimes hard to differentiate from McConaughey if not for the shirt situation and, uh, other actors like Jack's father on Lost.Here's what it comes down to: there are plenty of totally cringe-worthy moments, scenes where laughs are attempted and fall flat, and some lazy cinematography and music and a story that is so easy to read through you know who every character is and what their destination will be within ten seconds of seeing him or her (and that goes for miss wannabe Baywatch star too). And yet, it's also a laid back movie for a niche crowd that doesn't try to please to audiences that aren't meant for it. Maybe I wasn't meant for it either, and I do like some of these actors and comedies with stoners and surfing and waves and uh virtual reality plots hatched by... oh what the hell, it's a retarded puppy of modern movies. It may be stupid, but it's still a puppy"
College Road Trip             ,joecantongamingguru,1,adventure,2008,5,"This film goes to show that you can be on top of the world and fall all the way down. With ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"",""Wild Hogs"" and now ""College Road Trip"" under Lawrence's belt, i don't know how much more he can take. This movie is pretty standard ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" film. With all the sight gags and kiddy jokes about pigs and dancing, and, of course the soft spot for tolerance. Donny Osmond was straight forward in this film and Lawrence was really exaggerated as a goofy dad. Raven Symone played a OK part, but not a real big leap forward for the young actress. Of course, this doesn't mean the film is all bad. The movie, in its quirky way is funny. With its zany comedy style, like animal humor and kiss jokes...this film reaches to little kids. If you have young ones, this wont be bad for them, but for you...its okay."
Stop-Loss             ,DarknessNamed,0,drama,2008,7,"Stop-Loss, produced by MTV Films and directed by Kimberly Peirce brings us a new a movie part of a small genre of military films that have popped up, not to glorify the horrors of war but to look at a different aspect of the soldier's psyche. In this case we are introduced to Ryan Phillipe's character who has experienced immense amounts of violence, blood, and sadness during his tour in Iraq and the numerous missions he took part in. His plans to disembark from the Army are halted when he is ""stop-lossed"" by the U.S. government and is re-enlisted against his will, prompting him to go on a journey to Washington to seek help from his senator whom he feels can help him get out of this situation. Performances all around were well done, and they help to make up for the major issues I have with this film. Ryan Phillipe and Joseph-Gordon Levitt stand out among the cast and help to keep the story from becoming dull or slow-moving. Now to the real issues, setting aside that Ryan Phillipe goes from Texas to Tennessee, to New York City, all on a tank of gas AND a motorcycle, there are glaring issues that need to be addressed about his character. He sells his car for $1000, using that money towards a set of Canadian identification, yet moments later he is standing on the Mexican border ready to walk across it. If Ryan Phillipe was so dead-set on going out of the country, why didn't he just use the Canadian papers that he had sold his car for, and dropped in $1000 for? Did he just go to Mexico because it was convenient, after he rode to Texas in a DAY for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's funeral on his new motorcycle? And why does he decide to go back to the Army after all? We see no sign of emotion on his face when he is sitting on the bus, was it all just a dream? You would think that a person who goes AWOL, which by the way is a very serious offense, would have a little more signs of resistance or emotion in their eyes when they are sitting on the bus of the thing which they swore minutes earlier was wrong and was something that they would never return to. Channing Tatum was also told to bring Phillipe in, in 14 hours or else Phillipe would face federal charges, Tatum fails to do this, yet Phillipe is SITTING ON THE BUS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE AS IF NOTHING IN THE MOVIE EVER HAPPENED. No charges filed? No demotion was in order? Nothing? This movie would have been a lot better if he had just shut up, and gone to Mexico, the ending is a clear discontinuity in terms of the characters and the emotions of the whole movi"
Saw V             ,zegrosowl,0,crime,2008,7,"To say the least, I was NOT disappointed. I enjoyed the film as much as I thought I would. Going in, I had some doubts, what with a new director and this being a fifth installment in a horror series (they usually start sucking by the 3rd). As soon as the opening credits start, you can already tell that a different director had his hands on the project. Acceptence doesn't take long to sink in though. As expected, the film meets the typical Saw requirements. Multiple traps and more revealing back-story. Simply put, Saw V should not disappoint the loyal Saw fan. I know I'll be back for the next installment with bells on.Seeing that this is the fifth film, you simply MUST see 1-4 in order to truly understand all the flashbacks. I don't want to give anything away, so all I will say is this: The very last trap in this film is one of my new favorites. . . "
Pride and Glory             ,Slaughterlouse,,crime,2008,6,"Colin Farrell, Edward Norton, Noah Emmerich, and Jon Voight all deliver great performances. There are many intense scenes throughout the movie, and Norton and Farrell match them with their own intensity. Voight is believable and realistic as the patriarch of the family of cops and the chief, trying to keep his family in order as he thinks it should be.Despite the inspired performances of the main characters, however, Pride and Glory falls short due to awkward pacing, pointlessly convoluted side-stories revealed in equally pointless scenes, and a general lack of focus. Pride and Glory tries to tell two or three stories at once, but fails to really punctuate any one of them, leading to a fairly emotionless climax and no discernible, unifying theme. The result is a forgettable movie and a hint of buyer's remorse; if you're a big enough fan of Ed Norton or Colin Farrell and want to see either of them put on a great performance, catch the matinée, or even still, wait a few months and rent it. 1"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,maxdetroit,0,action,2008,6,"Sorry, but after reading all this negative comments, I like to give you my thoughts on this. When I walked out of the movie I was not really satisfied, because some things bothers me, like the monkey-rope scene and some other ridiculous and illogical things. But, then I remembered scenes from the first three movies, like jumping out of a plane with a rubber boat and then bob run with it down the Himalaya. Or Indy hanging on top of submarine and then swims with it through half of the ocean (isn't such a thing going underwater sometimes?). Well, what I want to say is that in the old Indy films there where tons of ridiculous stunts and it always was very cartoonish and yes, often cheesy. But as I child I liked those movies for that. They are just adventures with a lot of action, mystic and fun, not more.We have all grown up (with all that logic and reason), and we want the movie to fascinate us again like the first three did as we were a child. The disappointment is programmed. The movie is still an Indiana Jones Movie, it has so many running gags and links to the first three ones, it's truly a tribute to the fans. (Even that Indy starts Mutt to call 'Junior' was a nice one.) Maybe this one is too much of an Indiana Jones movie, because it just delivers elements that can be found in the first three movies too (the car chases, insects, falling down of waterfalls, e.g.) - but what else do we want? Also I didn't think the CGI was too much, I even found it was decent. And yes, this one was made to make money. The first three were also made to make money. Films are supposed to make money - so what? So, maybe just watch the first three again, then relax and just sit back and enjoy this one. It's not supposed to be drop dead serious and realistic. And when I look back, I wasn't bored throughout the whole movie, it was very entertaining. It's maybe just the long time between this and the last one, some things have changed, if we like it or not. But I am thankful that this movie was made.The only thing I was missing was the whip - it has one scene in the beginning and then Indi uses it never again in this movie. I always liked the whip, because it's not a normal weapon for a hero, and makes Indi a little more special. 900"
"Surfer, Dude             ",antaru_1976,0,comedy,2009,9,"Here is this movie and here I am, someone who liked it. A movie which got huge slaps in the face by critics pointing that this isn't more than something stoners would make for other stoners; and myself who never touched weed or any drugs.Even so, I liked Surfer, Dude. Better to say: I loved it. Because it helped me rethink what is important in life and what isn't.The main character (Addington) represents everything that people living in the cage of the consumer / mass society can only dream about, or should be dreaming about.He is the free man, part of and living with nature. Not a 9 to 5 office worker like the most of us, not someone having only twenty-some days off a year. Not working for the profit (which actually goes to other one's pocket), he is living for living, enjoying life, experiencing the mystery or magic of nature.There is a big contrast in the movie. The artificial vs the real. The video game and reality show versus the real surfing and life under the sun. Inside and outside.Addington is like a creature from another world, but at the end of the film it feels like he is the one from planet Earth (with the goat shepherd and the fisherman) and on the other hand we who made the fields chessboard looking, made the trees stand in order and in the exact same distance from each other in the forest, we are the aliens, or robots. He is the relaxed one we are the frustrated ones. He does only the positive things, and none of the negative ones, not even for money. ""Not feelin' it. Not into it"". This thing is double stated with the soul/Seoul people scene after the cast, at the very end of the movie.Actually I recommend Surfer, Dude for those, who feel frustrated after work or feel like there is more to life than doing overtime for surplus production.Yes the plot is simple, but has important questions. I accept the statement that the flow of the story is very slow, too. And overall, it could be a little bit better, like everything else.But the stills are beautiful. And in its slow way it gives me a long smile instead of periodic laughter.Chill out with the movie, dude. And think about your life for a minute."
The Brothers Bloom             ,tedg,1,action,2011,NA,"The structure here selects one of the few models we have for dramatizing inner complexities. The grand problem is that people are fascinating, but we need a narrative skeleton to ""see"" into them. One choice is to take a standard narrative device and open it. The standard device is the detective film, where an on-screen character takes action and uncovers truth, sharing it with us. The ""con"" twist on that is that we are cast among the unknowing. It is a powerful shift.In the usual con form, the viewer is not specifically represented in the film, but the writer is. This variant has a con partnership of two brothers. One writes the life of the other, so successfully that the one written is void of a self. The ""writer"" decides to write an anti- reflexive story to fix this, and this is what we witness. The writer literally needs to die. The thing is surrounded by references to James Joyce, who invented the intent (at least) of writing himself away.It surely is cleverly constructed and has some attraction just on that score. But alas, this is yet another example of where narrative insight does not produce narrative power. The film does not engage. It lacks magic and we do not enter the opening that has been made. It is easy to blame the actors, but the filmmaker just lacks the skill.But, I would advise you see this because of Rinko Kikuchi. I have not been seeking her out, yet. But I sure stumble into her work in viewing great films. She may be Japan's best living actress, now trying to carry that into non-Japanese forms. So far, the roles have been friendly, and here she simply radiates.Her role is as the silent observer and demolition expert. She places herself in a vague sexual relationship with the writer-brother, just by walking into the narrative. She must die as well, and blows herself up to ""trigger"" the end. She wears strawberry blond hair.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting element"
Changeling             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,misc,2008,10,"Clint Eastwood, the master of making depressing films now makes his trilogy: Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and now Changeling. Based of the horrific chicken coop murders from the 1920's in California, we get a deeper insight into one of the mothers of the victims, Christine Collins who is portrayed by Angelina Jolie, queen of the never ending tears. I'm just playing, she does a terrific job and is just so heart breaking to watch her story on film, she gives Christine a lot of character and depth. The film is even made a certain way, a lot of dark colors, it seems as if it was made in old Hollywood, which was a very intelligent way of setting the mood and time of the film. We have some very fine performances pretty much from everyone in this movie. The one flaw I did feel is that the script does have some lines that are a little over done, a little too dramatic, but it really works for the film and story.Christine Collins is a single mother in the 1920's, she's a strong woman who is even ahead of some of the men in her line of work as an operator manager. But she's so busy with work that she tries to make time with her son, Walter. One day they are going to go to the movies, but Christine has to go to work, she says she'll meet Walter right back at home, she's late of course and when she gets home, Walter is missing. She calls the police, but they say she has to wait 24 hours. After a few months, the police tell her they've found her son, she couldn't be happier... that is until she sees a boy who is not her son. But the police will not fess up and admit they messed up, so instead of helping Christine, they treat her horribly and throw in her in an insane asylum and quite looking for her son, but the town's Rev. Gustav Briegleb will not give up and expose the police for the horrible people they are and will do anything to help Christine find her son.Changeling is a great film, one of the best of 2008, you know this is going to be a big contender for Oscar season. I really enjoyed this film, I have to admit it had me in tears, all that this poor woman went through to find her son, the pain and mental mind, well you know the f word, that the police put her through, I felt so horrible for her. Jeffrey Donovan just plays the ultimate jerk who just keeps playing gaslight on Christine Collins forcing a child who is not her son down her throat. Although I think this film could have been a good comedy if they gave her an Asian baby or something and try to convince her then that that's her son, lol, OK, that was so bad, sorry. But seriously, this is a great film, I do highly recommend that you take the chance to see it in the theater if you can.10/10"
Four Christmases             ,fkozmet,1,comedy,2009,1,"This movie is unwatchable.With the impressive cast, this movie promises to entertain, but instead annoys and disappoints. You at first begin to dislike the scenes, and then as it goes on, you begin to dislike the characters, and as it goes on further, you begin to dislike the actors, even if you've liked them in other movies. The movie is so bad, that it makes even the movie house popcorn taste bad.Even after the movie moves on to a watchable scene, the reappearance of a minor character from a dreadful scene brings back the feeling of dread and spoils even the watchable scene. And as a Christmas movie, it has as much charm as listening to a tone deaf singer work their way through all your favourite Christmas carols. You find yourself hoping that you're able to suppress the memory of this movie when Christmas does come around.Bah, and humbug."
The Incredible Hulk             ,MovieAddict2016,0,action,2008,7,"In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success <U+0096> breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced.Then, of course, the negative word of mouth caught up with it <U+0096> and by the following weekend it had dropped a colossal 60%. It was quickly left floundering in theaters and only turned a profit thanks to worldwide intake.Marvel wasn't quite sure what to do <U+0096> the film's huge opening indicated an inherent interest in the material, but fans obviously didn't enjoy what they were seeing.Ang Lee's film was, to be fair, admirable in its scope and ambitions <U+0096> it wasn't your typical comic book action film. But, at the end of the day, most audiences don't want two-and-a-half hour psychological explorations when they go to see a Hulk movie <U+0096> they want big battle scenes and lots of bruising action, both of which the 2003 Hulk <U+0096> for the most part <U+0096> failed to deliver.I count myself among the masses that disliked the 2003 film <U+0096> not because I was a fan of the comics and not because I was disappointed in its treatment of the material; not even because I thought it was boring, necessarily. I simply thought in spite of its aim to be an intelligent movie, it was quite silly and pretentious <U+0096> the end fight sequence was appalling, for example. It was a film containing moments of genius cornered by lots of unnecessary scenes and scenery chewing by Nick Nolte.So, with this in mind, the ultimate question is: does the 2008 Hulk deliver on its promise to be bigger, bolder and better? Well, in short, yes <U+0096> it's still not a great film by any means, and it has its fair share of flaws (most notably the last twenty minutes which, despite a cool battle sequence, go overboard in their destruction), but at the end of the day, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster with a cast that's probably a little better than it deserves.Edward Norton would have been my last choice as Bruce Banner <U+0096> not because I think he's bad for the role, but rather because he is such an unexpected choice. Renowned for his anti-mainstream approach to film-making and his artistic credibility, his placement in a comic book franchise sequel/reboot is puzzling to say the least <U+0096> it would be like Christian Bale taking on a role in a Batman or Terminator movie (oh, wait).The thing is: Norton delivers a solid performance. I'm not sure if it's better than what Eric Bana tried to achieve (I'd say Bana's performance is a bit more complex overall), but I think that's partly due to the film's length and also because it's so action-packed. For what it's worth, Norton tries his best to inject some humanity into the character; the whole Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde aspect is more prevalent here than in the 2003 film. In that movie, Bana's Banner admitted to enjoying the transformation into the Hulk; in 2008, Norton is struggling to conceal and control it.William Hurt replaces Sam Elliot as General Ross, the man responsible for Bruce's predicament. The movie is essentially a cat-and-mouse game, with Banner hiding away in Brazil for over a year, until Ross finally discovers his location <U+0096> prompting Bruce to flee back to North America in a last-ditch effort to find a cure for his ""disease."" He reunites with Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler), and finds himself at odds with an overzealous combatant named Blonsky (played by Tim Roth), who eventually transforms into Abomination.My problems with the film are most present in the latter half. The first 45 minutes is a lot of fun and is rather cleverly made <U+0096> the fight scenes are engaging and Roth establishes his anti-hero villain. But suddenly halfway through the movie, Blonsky turns into an unmotivated cliché of a bad guy, and by the end of the film you lose all care and understanding for the character. Once he transforms into the Abomination and goes on a citywide rampage in search of an equal foe (in this case, the Hulk), his reasons are puzzling.This is where the film truly falls apart, because suddenly General Ross is responsible for millions of dollars' worth of damage and civilian casualties (without spoiling any surprises, he is responsible for Blonsky's transformation), and he's flying around in an Army helicopter following the city's destruction, but nobody really seems to care. He never loses his job, even after he tears up a college campus in search of the Hulk earlier in the film. It may be pointless to criticize a comic book film for lapses in logic, but since the film strives for a sense of realism in its early scenes, the switch to excess halfway through is a bit disheartening. The 2003 Hulk had the same problems, incidentally <U+0096> I'm wondering if it's a flaw of the comic book or just the character itself; perhaps it's too hard to retain realism when you've got a 12-foot giant green dude destroying everything in sight.If I'm being too critical, it's only because I enjoyed the film and regretted these aspects. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining summer blockbuster -- and that's really all it needed to be. 1"
Summer Hours             ,Chris Knipp,1,drama,2008,8,"Assayas says this film more or less sums up all his work so far, and that may surprise some, since it is so different, so indistinguishable in many ways from the work of other contemporary French filmmakers who deal with middle class life. And the impulse behind the film was something trivial and occasional, a request from the Musée d'Orsay to do something, as they'd asked Hou Hsiau-hsien (the result was Hou's 'Flight of the Red Balloon'). Hou's film uses the d'Orsay so incidentally I can hardly remember how it fits in; but Assayas takes the idea of a museum quite seriously and literally. His story is about a family, and a mother who dies in her mid-seventies leaving behind a house and a collection of museum pieces, works of art, furniture, and fine objects.We begin with a scene quite conventional in French films: the seasonal family gathering. The 'Heure d'été' (summer hour), is a moment when adult siblings Adrienne (Juliette Binoche, the star of Hou's 'Balloon,' though including her again was not a d'Orsay requirement), Frédéric (Charles Berling, his third time in an Assayas film, and a kind of alter ego here), and Jérémie (Jérémie Renier) with parts of their families, have come to the family's beautiful country place to celebrate the 75th birthday of their mother Hélène (Edith Scob). Hélène is one of those perfectly slim, elegant, erect French women. She spends a lot of time telling Frédéric, to his annoyance, about the valuables the children will inherit when she dies, including a handsome 19th-century desk, display case, and other objects, the sketchbooks of her famous uncle, the artist Jean Berthier, two Corot paintings, and two large sketches by Odilon Redon. They will want to dispose of them all, she says, and the house. She has certain requirements. The D'Orsay wants the furniture; the sketchbooks must be kept together. Some objects she is giving to him.After this sequence, Hélène is dead, perhaps a year later. She has gone to San Francisco for the start of a major traveling exhibition of Berthier's work, and there has been a presentation in France on his personal life (including the fact that he was gay, and other controversial information) which shook her considerably. And her involvement in the production of a book, a catalog, and the traveling exhibition all wore her down and left her devastated and empty when they were completed.It is against Frédéric 's wishes, but when the siblings meet again, it's obvious Hélène was right and the possessions and the house must be sold, and the old housekeeper, Eloise (Isabelle Sadoyan) must be released. Jérémie, who works for a company that makes running shoes, is going to take his wife and kids to live in China permanently. Adrienne, who is a designer, lives in New York, and she's going to marry her American boyfriend and stay there. They can't go back to the country house regularly any more. It seems Frédéric gets a raw deal, because he, whom the dispersal of family heirlooms hurts the most, is going to have to deal with the nuts and bolts of the process, because he's the only one who lives in France. But that's the way it is, and what's more Jérémie needs money to set up in his new life in China.Assayas goes into the details, even showing a meeting of the curators and administrators concerned with the donation at the Musée d'Orsay. They are particularly interested in the furniture and the Redons (the Corots are sold elsewhere). One official objects that these things will just go into storage.This is a suavely composed picture, but it still comes across as the most elegant of instructional films, if such existed for showing at posh schools to teach children of the wealthy how to deal with inheritances in the world of globalization. Yes, globalization is what Assayas is talking about, though the word is used in his comments on the film, not in the screenplay itself. Assayas' didacticism this time is admirably straightforward, and at the same time, the ideas are presented in what for Assayas is an unusually warm context. One of the touchstones is the old housekeeper, Eloise, who returns to the house when it's been shut up, and goes to Hélène's grave to deposit flowers. The important point is that this is not about the traditional family squabble over inheritance. Though Frédéric is saddened, there is no argument, and he and Jérémie pointedly (maybe too pointedly) part friends. There are other little details that are accurate and practical. It's pointed out that Adrienne's plan to sell the sketchbooks in New York through Christie's won't work. The French government is unlikely to let them out of the country. Frédéric is away a lot too, and for whatever reason he has to pick up his teenage daughter, caught stealing, and holding pot. But the final scene, which again is warmly didactic, shows that daughter with her boyfriend and a bunch of her friends invading the old house one last time, saying a sad farewell..As I'm not the first to comment, this is one of Assayas' simplest films, but it's also one of his most touching and meaningful. Instructional film though it may be, it deals with subject matter that can move the hardest heart. If you don't care about losing a parent, you will surely be touched with the thought of losing the places of your childhood--and family money. If love won't get you, money will. And there is a final meditation by Frédéric at the D'Orsay where he and his wife Lisa (Dominique Reymond) look at the objects they've donated (not in storage) and consider the other trade-off: a contribution to history and the public's culture has been made, but the objects are like prisoners now, shut up in a cold space, robbed of their human context in a family's life."
Street Kings             ,shanayneigh,,misc,2008,NA,"I kind of enjoyed this movie. Technically, there's nothing wrong with it. The acting is OK, although I'm not a big fan of Amaury Nolasco's. The story is somewhat engaging.But it fails completely with the whole ""who dunnit"" thing (I don't want to give too much away). It's blatantly obvious from the very beginning who did it, so the filmmakers attempts to give the story some twists and turns in an effort to confuse the audience as to who did it are completely dead in the water. It's a shame, really. The whole movie, you're just sitting there waiting for the inevitable showdow"
The Strangers             ,bbman911,,horror,2008,2,"I was so excited to see this movie I took the day off work to go see it...what a waste. I kept thinking ""Here we go"", ""Okay, this is it"" for the movie to actually get going...but I was wrong each time.The director spends too much time getting us to like the couple in the movie, but honestly does a terrible job at that. The opening sets the stage for a terrific movie. A 911 call saying ""there is blood everywhere"". Really? After seeing the movie, I expect to only see blood in two places, not exactly everywhere.Most of the ""strangers"" actions are done to scare the audience, not the characters in the movie. How many times can the ""strangers"" be seen in the background but the main characters don't realize it...how is that scary to them if they don't know they are there??? The trailer actually is a bit scarier than the actual movie, especially once you see the ending... I still can't believe that the director/writer/et al actually watched the climax of the movie and said, ""that nailed it, perfect!!!"" So anticlimactic that they felt obliged to thrown in a cheap ""gotcha""/starting scene right at the end of the movie. (wait did I accidentally see ""Scream""?) 1"
Frozen River             ,buzzbruin,1,crime,2008,NA,"For a first time director, a superb job, The general theme is single mothers fighting for their very life. Living on next to nothing,trying to raise their children with almost no resources but their own courage. They are at the very edge of society living in forbidding land of ice snow and frozen lakes and rivers. Both Melissa Leo and the native American woman must make terrible choices in order to live. Despite what the main stream critics have said, the picture is photographed wonderfully and there are no cheap props other indications of cheap film. The actors are fabulous and the characters are interesting, true to life and the story makes sense. This film is a classic, and I hereby nominate both female leads for Oscars. see this film ASAP!!"
The Duchess             ,milofromtheblock,1,misc,2008,7,"The Duchess is a superior slice of costume drama which manages to craft interesting, multi dimensional characters and an involving storyline from the well worn confines of the genre.Keira Knightley plays a very similar role to the one she played in Pride and Prejudice, a feisty, modern woman trapped in a male dominated society. However, whereas Lizzie Bennett's heart and character inspires affection, the Duchess of Devonshire's fosters only reproach and punishment from her traditional and patriarchal husband. Her performance is a standout and demonstrates why she is so highly rated in the face of many disappointing roles in other films. She brings both strength and weakness to the character. Able to deliver withering put downs at her husband and others, whilst showing the pain of her loveless marriage etched into her face.If Knightley is the lynchpin of the piece then it is Ralph Fiennes that elevates it above a crowded genre. Resisting the temptation to play his character as evil, instead he simply plays him as a man of his times. In Fiennes' hands the Duke feels no need to win any bouts of verbal jousting with his wife as he is secure in the knowledge that, as a husband, he is in complete control of the relationship. The Duke also clearly sees very little wrong in his treatment of his wife and acts, as he sees it, in a logic manner making the whole film feel more believable and, as a result, tragic.In terms of the cast the only misstep is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who lends the wide eyes of a political dreamer but doesn't have convincing chemistry with Knightley and plays one of the more one dimensional characters in the piece. However Hayley Atwell impresses by playing her character so well it is possible to describe her as scheming, and manipulative as well as sympathetic and loyal without it seeming a contradiction.The film is deliberately paced so as to give characters and events time to breathe, encouraging the mood that the marriage is a car crash in slow motion, inextricably drawing all the characters further into the muddled mess of their relationships. Overall it's a fully recommended slice of real life costume drama that draws a multi layered drama full of compellingly deep characters from what could easily have been a one note story. 1"
Summer Hours             ,writers_reign,1,drama,2008,8,"This is a haunting film that's difficult to classify combining as it does the melancholy of Uncle Vanya with background music by the Dave Brubeck quartet. The central metaphor may seem a tad labored but it's also effective: the film opens with a lyrical shot of a large, rambling country house in which young children beguile the summer afternoon in innocent games; at the end, with the matriarch dead, the house in the process of being sold and the contents dispersed to places like musee d'Orsay, the house and gardens are overrun with teenagers throwing a wild party complete with rap. In between is some class acting from the likes of Edith Scob, Charles Berling, Jeremie Renier and a blonde Juliette Binoche as mother and siblings respectively. This is a film in which pain is always below the surface and there are virtually no blow-ups signalling the unleashing of home-truths all round. This family is already fragmented long before the mother dies and has the feel of Sautet at his best - Cesar et Rosalie, Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud, Un Coeur en hiver - heady company sure but this movie can stand comparison."
The Square             ,mdayne0225,0,crime,2010,10,"It is funny that the Edgerton brothers collaborated on this film since it reminds me a great deal of another movie crafted by two brothers. If you have ever seen Blood Simple, a Coen brothers production, this movie will remind you of it. Two lovers hatch a simple plot to steal money and run away together, but are thwarted by unforeseen circumstances, blackmail, misdirection and unforeseen deceit. The acting in this film is superb, starting with the leads and certainly Joel Edgerton who does a 180 from his character in Kinky Boots.I highly recommend this movie.

Four Christmases             ,Parks,1,comedy,2009,3,"Sigh. Another potentially funny Hollywood comedy hits the skids when it encounters a message. The message here seems to be, ""Families Are Hideous And Awful, But Everyone Should Be Forced To Have One"". No, I don't understand the logic of that either.The families are made up of 4 sets of familiar comedy archetypes - the yokels, the interfering women, the religious kooks and - um - the fourth set who the writers couldn't be bothered to make interesting or unusual. I suppose you can't blame them for losing interest - I know I had.Phoned-in performances and a faxed-in script result in a charmless, pointless holiday film. The only good thing about it is the charisma of the leads, and a funny appearance by Jon Favreau. But seriously, you would be better advised to watch National Lampoon's Xmas Vacation again instead."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,moviewizguy,0,misc,2008,7,"A rebellious street dancer named Andie, part of Baltimore's most intimidating dance crew, the 410, who is given a chance to attend the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts.

Determined to prove her skills, she assembles an eclectic crew of classmates that includes Chase, the schools best dancer, to compete against the 410 in the premier underground dance battle in Baltimore, The Streets.I quite enjoyed Step Up, although the plot was clichéd and predictable, but the dance moves were good. Now picture that, times TEN! Anyone crazy enough to see this movie for the plot should not see this film. Why would anyone see this movie? The dance moves.There are double the dancing sequences and double the greatness! I was won over by it. The charming two leads and the lovable characters add as the cherry on top. The plot? There's nothing there. Been there. Done that. However, if you set your expectations right, you'll be surprised to turn out that you like this movie.Obviously, if you're an older person, you may not like this movie as much as if you're a teen. Of course, the demographics for this movie is to attract teens. All in all, this is about a notch or two better than the original, but plotwise, it's the same. Watch this movie for the dances. Not the plot. Otherwise, the piece is entertaining."
Frozen River             ,claudio_carvalho,1,crime,2009,6,"In Massena, New York, nearby a Mohawk Reservation and the Canadian border, the middle-aged Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) is left by her husband a couple of days before Christmas. Her husband is a gambler and stole the family savings and the car, driving to an unknown destination and leaving Ray alone and without money to raise her two sons. When she sees the Mohawk Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham) driving her car, she follows the woman up to her trailer to retrieve the car. Lila lures her telling that she has a buyer for the vehicle, but she actually wants to use the large trunk to smuggler illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States through a frozen river in the Mohawk Reservation. Ray unsuccessfully tries to convince her boss to promote her in her part time job; without any alternative to make honest money, Ray decides to associate to Lila to raise enough money to pay for her dream house and do not lose her down payment. ""Frozen River"" is an overrated little movie with a realistic and depressing story of two women that smuggle people to raise money to support their families. Melissa Leo has a stunning performance in the role of a desperate mother that is going to lose the house she has dreamed to raise her sons after her addicted husband stealing the family savings. Unfortunately the plot is short and for viewers that live in Third World countries, the drama is Ray is original only in the environment. Her financial situation does not justify the smuggling and is equivalent (or worse) than poor people acting as mules transporting drugs for example. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rio Congelado"" (""Frozen River"")"
What Happens in Vegas             ,AnnaShade,1,comedy,2008,NA,"Despite the surly comments of others, this movie is not a waste of time. When I first saw the preview, I was completely doubtful as to the quality of this movie. I mean, accidental marriage in Vegas? Ashton Kutcher AND Cameron Diaz? Like, together? It was a bit scary.However, after watching it I realized I'd had a lot of fun through the movie. It's only and hour and a half, so it's not going to stretch on forever. Kutcher and Diaz provided enough funny moments to make the movie fairly amusing, but what really surprised me was their chemistry. Maybe it was because I was so negative about it before, but they went together well. There were also a few sweet moments and a few with more tension, which was good. Unfortunately, I found some other parts of the movie sweeter than the end, but it wasn't that bad.The screenplay is nothing new, but then what movie is THAT original? Not many. The point is, it's fun and a good time if you want to spend an hour or so relaxing. Even my brother (who is a die hard action fan) didn't mind the movie.No matter how original or unexpected a movie is, if it doesn't entertain me, I DON'T CARE. This one was entertaining. Isn't that the point of films? Oh, and the soundtrack was a blast!"
Cook County             ,larry-411,1,drama,2008,NA,"""Cook County"" was part of the Lone Star States section, focusing on Texas filmmakers, at the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. I attended the World Premiere last weekend and felt that I was witnessing the birth of a future indie classic.Anson Mount (""The Battle of Shaker Heights,"" ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"") and Ryan Donowho (""Imaginary Heroes,"" ""The O.C."") are cousins traveling down a path of drug-fueled self-destruction. The difference is that one wants out while the other is too far gone to care. Having a meth lab in the house is quite a convenient way of staying obliviated and Bump (Mount) takes full advantage of it. Abe (Donowho) might have been all too happy to play along if not for the fact that he sees his niece, Bump's daughter Deandra (Makenna Fitzsimmons in a career-launching role), being neglected in the process. Enter the prodigal son, Bump's brother Sonny (Xander Berkley), fresh out of prison. Sonny is determined to play peacemaker but his loyalties are divided.The Texas backwoods set is almost another character, providing the perfect den of iniquity for the nonstop party. Natural lighting and hand-held camera, with frequent extreme closeups, enhances the claustrophobic feeling and brings the viewer right into the stench. I almost felt uncomfortable at times, as though I was invading their space. The soundtrack is haunting and the action unrelenting.This is a true character-driven piece that can be difficult to watch at times but is hard to turn away from, like a wreck on the highway. Mount's performance is a tour de force and one of the best I've seen in a long time. Donowho is the perfect puppy dog who gets caught between a rock and a hard place in challenging his cousin for the safety of the girl. His work has always impressed me and this is by far his most challenging role, and he nails it. As intrigue creeps in the story becomes absolutely unpredictable. Writer/director David Pomes has crafted a masterful work which kept me guessing right until the end.Kudos to the production team for getting every element right in telling this truly original story. I had no idea where ""Cook County"" was going and I suspect that's what life must be like for lowlifes like this."
Twilight             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,misc,2008,5,"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10 2"
College Road Trip             ,Dragoneyed363,1,adventure,2008,7,"I honestly don't see what the big fuss over College Road Trip is. It wasn't a bad movie, in my opinion. It was actually really lovable, and even though it was certainly mediocre most of the time, and I felt as if at some parts they tried too hard to please the audience with mediocre jokes, it was still very entertaining, and contained a pretty good amount of laughable, and that's laughable in the humorous way, material.It was also nice seeing Raven Symone in this movie, because I am always used to seeing her in what she's famous for, That's So Raven, and it was enlightening to know she played a role, because I love her in that show. Also, even though Martin Lawrence isn't one of the best actors, and definitely isn't one of my favorites, he's not a terrible one, and if you ask me everyone in this movie could act well for their roles, to some extent. There were scenes where I felt as if the antics were outdated and some lines were just not pulled off to the best of the casts' abilities, but when it was over I ended up having fun with it, and that's what it was meant to be in the first place.It was of course no masterpiece, and it could have been handled a lot more professionally than it was, but doesn't a ton of movies fall under those categories, and yet, many people enjoy them. Overall, it was a good little movie, that isn't as horrible as the rating and negative comments let on to be, so if you're any bit interested in seeing this movie, go ahead, because it wasn't bad or disappointing at all."
Trucker             ,OliverGbyrne,1,drama,2015,NA,"This is a very raw film. Trucker Diane who always lived by her own rules , rather selfishly not caring about anybody but herself get her life turned upside down when her son,Peter whom she have not seen since he was a baby needs to stay with her a couple of weeks while his father is in the hospital , sick, fighting for his life. Diane has no Motherly vibe in her body (Or she thinks) and she his not to please about having to take care of the boy. The kid hate having to stay with a woman who do not seem to care one bit for him. The two of them will have to figure out a common ground to at least ""Tolerate each other"" On the plus side Diane has the help of her friend played (And rather well at that) by Nathan Fillion to ease the long way ahead for this mother/son relationship to evolve into something ... well that looks like a mother/son relationship. Michelle Monaghan is outstanding , she his truly Oscar material in that movie. She his a very flawed woman who lived her life head on not caring for any one she might bump into along the way. Her truck is her home , her house is simply a rest stop so of course the arrival of her kid and all the responsibility that comes with it is not welcome. Monaghan performance is great because it literally turns an unlikeable person likable. She find the humanity in that broken woman , that little light that will eventually grow to help her create a relationship with her son.Diane is rude,vulgar,selfish but you still wants her to find her way and she his fascinating for all her flaws. If this film was more known I would have scream ""Oscar nomination now!"" Young Jimmy Bennett is quite impressive for his young age as the kid. He his not the typical kid you will find in these type of drama , he his raw , angry and he his not afraid to curse at his mother.Well , he feels real. We also see the more sensitive side of him in every scene with his father.Great Job all around. The mixture of Monaghan and young Bennett creates a wonderful dynamic, it is a train wreck of a relationship and to see it evolve into something remotely normal is quite a ride. All supporting actors does a good job but this film is really Monaghan show and you will not want to keep your eyes off her. This film is a hidden gen that should be seen by more people. It's a drama that drops all the sugar coating and it is so refreshing in these day of age. I give this film a 9 out of 1"
Flash of Genius             ,jdesando,0,misc,2008,NA,"Just imagine over 30 years ago inventing something as useful as the intermittent windshield wiper, a device everyone uses when it rains. Now that's immortality for inventor Bob Kearns, professor and engineer.What is more astonishing is he was almost forgotten after the Ford Motor Company usurped the design and promoted it as its own. The dramatic tension is Kearns' fight for recognition involving years of personal and familial losses. The two moments of inspiration, the ""flash of genius,"" one a personal eye injury and the other driving in the driving rain, are dramatically satisfying if not downright underplayed (appealing to my minimalist sensibilities).The film is exciting when Kearns is developing the device with those design inspiration moments fleshed out and the partnering with Ford slowly materializing. The film slows down as if in a school zone when at least a third of the Kearns' time is spent struggling with wife Phyllis Kearns (Lauren Graham) over the cost to them in time and trauma to go after Ford. The dutiful wife suffering the ambitious husband has been played in American cinema and theater too much to be fresh, no different here. The scenes with family, especially his wife, evoke my usual response: All right, already, I get the point. Now get on to the good stuff.Similarly, Kinnear plays Kearns so low key as to be soporific. Although I don't doubt Kearns was an introverted geek, a dramatic rendition would have enlivened the character without compromising his essence."
W.             ,sparkle_fade95,0,misc,2008,5,"This movie was only able to scratch the surface of the man who will define a decade of disaster. With two hours of film, I was able to deduce little more then I already knew about W. and especially about his presidency. Stone barely mentioned 9/11, he did not get to Rumsfelds or Powells resignation, even though both characters were central features of the movie. Not even one glimpse of the 2004 election and only one sentence about the infamous 2000 elections. Lame. It really should have been a movie from George H.W. view since he was a dominating factor in every scene. His father might have been his biggest influence, it certainly was the biggest influence of this movie, but it didn't go far enough to explain the decisions of W. administration. That is were this filmed failed and why its just plain boring."
Four Christmases             ,Simon_Says_Movies,1,comedy,2009,2,"O come all ye faithful. That certainly seems to be the attitude that studios have at the holidays, sputtering out yearly Christmas flicks and luring all the little 'children' to their theatres made of gingerbread<U+0085>no matter how god-awful that movie may be. Those thinking that Four Christmases must be four times the fun of a normal Christmas movie, are about to get a truckload of coal at their front door, because you'll receive nothing but four times the pain, four times the tripe and four times the garbage.2008 marks the second year in a row a Vince Vaughn yuletide film has met the silver screen. I will not claim to have seen Fred Claus but I can honestly not envision it being any worse, and if it is then all those involved must simply hate the holiday season. Ironically it truly is the films gimmick that is its greatest determent. Of course if the film had been remotely funny then this would have been an asset, but being forced slog through two hours of atrocious slapstick and mean- spirited comedy is not how I wish to spend my valuable vacation time. With such talent involved, the absolute failure of Four Christmases is all the more lasting and if not for Vince Vaughn who gets the films only (and very, very few) laughs, the Grinch himself would have loved it.Following the only clever scene in the film in which Brad (Vince Vaughan) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) meet in a bar (although not to the end which you may expect) they plan their annual holiday trip down south for sun, relaxation and as an added bonus an ocean between them an their families. But following heavy fog in their home city of San Francisco their flight is delayed, and thanks to a pesky reporter are featured on the news, which of course their families are watching. Thus begins the hilarity, with the duo visiting each of their four divorced parents including Brad's father (an awful Robert Duvall) his professional fighter brothers Denver (an awful John Favreau) and Dallas (Tim McGraw) and his mother (Sissy Spacek). And on the other side, Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen) her baby loving sister Courtney (Kristin Chenoweth) and father (Jon Voight, who adds the only gravitas to the film). As the couple hops from home to home their relationship is put to the test. Will they learn the true meaning of family?In its wholeness, Four Christmases is really a spiteful and mean- spirited film where all the characters do, is fight. Kate and Brad fight, Kate and Brad fight with their families and their families fight amongst themselves, and I for one don't want to be watching material like that around what is supposed to be a joyous time of year. They openly avoid their families and their families really want nothing to do with them. Not a single person in this film seems like a real person and never encounter problems or family quirks that might hit home (and really people, if it does, take your family to see a shrink) in addition to having no characters which are in any way likable. I mean this truthfully, after the first Christmas I was ready to leave, and the same slapstick surfaces again and again like the appetizer you accidentally dropped in the egg nog at an open house; Baby spittle scenes, UFC takedowns and crude sexist jokes seem to make up this films backbone.A few times throughout Four Christmases the quip ""You can't spell families without lies"" appears. If this is what the Christmastime spirit is going to embody in the future of Hollywood, then you might as well just shove the ol' tannenbaum in the trash right now, which coincidently, is exactly where this piece of dreck belongs as well.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
Stop-Loss             ,ffrudderiii,0,drama,2008,2,"It is unfortunate that between this film, In the Valley of Elah, Lions for Lambs, and Home of the Brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The boozing, the fighting, the short-fuses, the broken marriages, guys freaking out and digging a foxhole in their front yard when they're drunk, etc etc etc.Does it happen - yes, but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies. I think that it is unfortunate that these directors/producers/writers choose to grind their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way. In this particular film, Kimberly Peirce didn't even throw us a bone, like showing the new children that were born while a family member was deployed, or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the GI Bill, or the couple who can afford a house, or start a new business, earn their citizenship, etc etc etc. Instead, we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this film only want to show you the bad side.A couple of issues with the film itself: 1) somebody screwed up by putting Phillippe in for a Bronze Star with V after he led his squad down a tight alleyway after having been baited by a gunman in a taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) the humvees didn't have any turret armor, so we are supposed to believe it is a near the beginning of the war, yet every soldier and their brother has an ACOG and every possible attachment for their M4? sorry, don't think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as a Lieutenant Colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked an he turned 40 in May, so the timing isn't too off. 4) He strikes two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying that he wouldn't return to Iraq (upon having learned that he had been stop-lossed). So he's a fugitive. Then, when he finally turns himself in at the end, and they take him back, he keeps his rank and deploys with the same unit? Sorry don't think so.I can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the Army and the Infantry. Do some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes, and really things just aren't like that for most soldiers returning. I wish the director had made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting off with her agenda and then making a film.Of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best one is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more a commentary on the sad state of Generation Y+ than it is about the Wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush Administration. If you really want to see this film wait for cable or Netflix it, don't pay cash directly to rent i"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,Absyrd,0,drama,2008,10,"After having developed pretty much the most successful directorial career of the decade, Fincher just refuses to hold back his enormous talent, always picking the risky projects and churning out an exhilarating piece of work. He's come a long way as it is, and then comes along the curious ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"". The title speaks for itself. The result can be anything between a predictable romantic drama, or a stirring, magical, unforgettable, heartbreaking, intelligent, challenging experience. I'm sure you can tell which direction I'm headed.Oh, what a curious case indeed. The film begins as a child, born on the day of the end of the Great War (symbol of the beginning of life?), is abandoned by his father outside a boardinghouse dedicated for seniors. It is quickly revealed that he was born ugly and wrinkled (not quite the appearance of a child, but ""still a child of God""). We don't find out immediately that he will lead his life physically aging backwards, but it is gradually revealed as he grows older, when his back begins to take shape and his wheelchair is rendered useless. What ensues after developing his bizarre nature, however, is the true core of this absolutely spellbinding masterpiece. There is always a lingering dread that his relationships will never work beyond their limited time frame, but its characters are driven by soul, not any shallow desires. The heart of the film is the relationship between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Will their love survive their difficult circumstances? Mortality is the key theme of this picture, the adamant difference between young and old age. Transience is man's greatest weakness. Although it's a pretty glum and straightforward thing to say that nothing lasts, the film does not depict itself through false optimism, but rather through hope. Hope that beneath these torn souls, there is the chance of wisdom and love overcoming mortality, and it culminates a damned poignant realization. There is also a playful theme to summarize the entire film -- no matter which way you age, life will always f-ck you. Tell that to the millions of women undergoing their midlife crisis, I guarantee the results will not be pretty. I'm getting off- track now, so let me just say this is possibly the best film of the year, and many years to come. 1"
The Objective             ,karlykins1967,,horror,2008,9,"For me, this was simply one of the best viewing experiences I have had in a long time, and believe me I watch a helluva lot of films! The cinematography was glorious, with astounding landscapes shot perfectly; also the score and sound effects track was simply out of this world, giving the film incredible ambiance and atmosphere throughout, and conjuring up perfectly a sense of esoteric mystery and making the unseen threat seem almost palpable in the desolate surroundings. In contrast to some of the other viewers' postings here on IMDb, I thought the acting was very realistic and believable, and the script well structured with good dialogue. Sure, the small company of soldiers here didn't have all the flashy catchphrasing and smart character interactions (""bughunt"", ""we're on an escalator to hell - going down!!"") that we all love from ""Aliens"" (as has been pointed out in other postings) but that was because it wasn't necessary nor would have been appropriate in the scenarios in ""The Objective"". Also, more films than ""Apocalypse Now"" have utilized to good extent the voice-over narration technique, and this is one of them. There's no more dialogue here than necessary, and like the other soldiers in the company, the audience is given just enough information in the voice-over to allow them to piece together just what they ""need to know"". The main problem some viewers seem to have with this film is that the plot line leaves the audience thinking at the end, with no easy answers and nicely tied-up resolution. That is a great thing - it is not lazy film-making whatsoever. I feel sad for the person in the postings who had to ask such inane questions as to why the key character was shown at the end where he was and doing what he was doing and how he got there (note how I neatly sidestepped giving anything away then?!) The answer is: because it is a FILM and as such, constraints like time, budget and artistic convenience mean that not every single action needs to (or should) be shown to us. Many things in life itself are not totally explained or resolved to the individual - and just as here, it is up to each viewer to come to his own ultimate conclusion and piece together a few fragments of their own. Bear these comments in mind before viewing, and if you are a viewer who enjoys a neat and tidy happy ending, then please look elsewhere. Otherwise, enjoy a simply excellent piece of film-making and cinematic experience!!"
The Dark Knight             ,the-movie-guy,0,action,2008,10,"(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10) 802"
Hancock             ,kathleen-pangan,0,action,2008,8,"Hancock was a pretty interesting as well as entertaining movie. It definitely wasn't your typical superhero movie; and it wasn't originally a DC or Marvel comic. It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times, and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a ""mask"" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted. I think the best part of Hancock is that it's about a superhuman who is just very human. It was a lot of fun. 1"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,bobertdos-1,1,adventure,2008,5,"I have been using IMDb to obtain feedback on movies for several years now, and what I find is that people here tend to be a little too bias toward A-list, blockbuster movies. Chihuahua does not fall into that category by any means, but that does not warrant dismissing it outright. It is true that the film's cast could have been put to better use, but given the parameters set by the Disney-style writing, they did what they could and it was enough to let me enjoy their performances. I read a review on here that commented on the inaccuracy of geographical information. I agree that if Disney is going to make a film like this, it is unfortunate that they do not take the time to educate their young audiences a little. We wouldn't be talking doctorate level research here, just basic fact-checking.The plot of this movie was not deep, but not many Disney movies NEED to be in order to cater to their young audience and family demographic. I am a twenty-something and I am able to tolerate Disney's material, because I accept it for what it is: shallow, vapid entertainment designed to convey squeaky-clean ideals to impressionable youth. Sometimes, they take that squeaky-cleanliness too far, like making light of the dog fights, but overall, it is all rooted in the same objective: to maintain their target demographic and intake revenue.To the people who reference the different caliber of Disney's entertainment ten or more years ago, I concur with you. It would be good for Disney to trace its roots a bit and return to basics, but it would take a lot of cutting through green to accomplish that.I enjoyed this movie. There was a comment on the discussion board mentioning that the trailer distorted people's initial impression. I am one of those people. Once I got into the movie though, I applied my usual preconditions for judging Disney films and had a good time. It was cute and in Disney's typical fashion, it contained half-baked attempts to teach the kids a thing or two (inaccurate or vague as they were).Go into it knowing it's Disney and will thus inherit the characteristics of all their work, and you'll be fine."
The Women             ,delwinchester,1,comedy,2008,1,"Imagine a film the complete opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having an all male cast, it has an all female cast. Instead of being set in the barren deserts of Arabia, it is set in the bulging metropolis of New York City. And instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most pointless, boring and forgettable.The film concerns Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a perfect wife and mother, the envy of all others in her high society Manhatten social circle. She is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child. But I don't want to be too hard on her, Mary does all this whilst taking a liassez-faire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her. This idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way.Mary's husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough. She is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little.Mary needs to bounce back though, for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself. She does this through rehab, hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes; though amazingly for this kind of film, not a montage. Mary succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now. She decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated, as she didn't dote on him enough.The films one saving grace is that it doesn't go down the ""all men are evil"" route."
The Objective             ,mail-1030,,horror,2008,7,"This a smart Sci-fi/horror/ War Movie in a similar vein to R-Point or Outpost, a bit of popular myth (this time on a Erik von Dankin tip)... set against the backdrop of the most modern of wars.It's low budget and fairly obscure, punching above its weight with superbly haunting location shots (Atlas Mountains Morocco) and tight audio FX / Soundtrack. The Special forces soldiers are believable too, kudos to the military adviser, and the acting's not bad too.The best think about 'The Objective'is the brooding pacing, It never scared me, more just left of field enough to make you think - this is and a bit different, that's a bit odd, this ain't Hollywood etc... and all the better for it... not surprising then to learn its from one of the directors from Blair Witch...On the flip side the heavy narration gives it a TV movie feel and though it kind of works in the end hmmmm, I dunno there was still a bit much. Narrative's a bit al over thae place, and whilst some might shout ""rubbish"" or IMDb fav ""worst movie ever"" I'll go for ""fun for what it is"" and that is on a par with an extended version of your fav X-file's/Outer limits episode.... Absolutely Recommended I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Objective'"
Four Christmases             ,Neenee-b,1,comedy,2008,5,"After last years foray into Christmas movies with the comedy without the comedy Fred Claus, Vince Vaughn is back this year again with another festive attempt - Four Christmases with Reese Witherspoon.The plot involves a couple Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Witherspoon) as they struggle to spend Christmas Day with all for of their divorcée parents.No matter the logistical problems of visiting four equally quirky parents the most unbelievable part of the whole movie was believing that the cuddly (fat if you are not a fan!) Vaughn could pull a girl like Reese Witherspoon but oddly enough it did work and there was some chemistry there despite set grumblings that the two did not get on very well.As with all comedies chemistry is important but so is the comedy. Vince Vaughn is a known to stray from the script and when this works it is hilarious but when it doesn't it truly fails. His one memorable scene and in fact the only laugh out loud scene in the whole movie is the nativity scene.I would give the movie 5/10. It was released well in time before the main Christmas Films in order not to completely bomb at the Box Office.The movie was good but I would wait a year and rent it next Christmas. It is the Christmas comedy which forgot all about the Christmas...and the comedy."
Shutter             ,claudio_carvalho,0,horror,2008,4,"In North America, after getting married, the photographer Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his wife Jane (Rachel Taylor) travel to Japan for a job opportunity with Ben's friends Bruno (David Denman) and Adam (John Hensley). While driving on a lonely road in Japan during the night, they have a car accident with Jane hitting a girl first and crashing a tree. When they awake, the police do not find any body and Ben believes that Jane imagined the situation. Later when Ben reveals his latest pictures, he finds some mysterious shadows, while the couple is systematically haunted by the ghost of the girl. Jane investigates and finds that the victim was Ben's former shy and weird girlfriend Megumi Tanaka (Megumi Okina), who worked as translator for Ben. Later Jane discloses deep and hidden secrets about the relationship of Megumi, Ben and his friends Bruno and Adam.The American version of ""Shutter"" is a mediocre remake of a great Asian horror movie. Actually it is ridiculous, with the author poorly using the same storyline and transforming a creepy and dark story in another Hollywoodian standard of silliness  shallow screenplay but with beautiful actresses, handsome lead actor and wonderful locations in Japan. If the viewer has never seen the original ""Shutter"" (2004) (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440803/), watch it instead. If the viewer has already seen the Thailand's movie, prefer watching it again. It will be better than wasting time watching this terrible remake. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Imagens do Além"" (""Images from Beyond"")Note: On 25 February 2012, I saw this film again."
Kisses             ,rooprect,1,drama,2014,NA,"On Christmas Day two kids run away. Trust me, they had good reason. ""Kisses"" takes us on the next 24 hours of their lives as they wander through Dublin looking for a guy named Barry who will supposedly take care of them. At the same time they are running from the imaginary ""sackman"" who, the girl insists, takes young children and animals, throws them in a sack and beats them to death for fun. The story of these 2 runaways is charming, terrifying, bleak, beautiful, and just about everything else in between.There is an instantly recognizable poetic quality to this film. That means: things are not necessarily spelled out, but instead we are made to piece together a backstory based on images, events and clues. Like the story of the 2 kids following the trail of this mysterious Barry fellow, we learn piece-by-piece exactly what's going on.There is a subtle yet strong structure to this film. It is told in chapters with each chapter ending with a kiss (hence the name ""Kisses""). Each kiss is symbolic and meaningful. Another interesting thing to note is the way the film changes between black & white and color, almost imperceptibly, yet in a very symbolic & meaningful way.If you haven't guessed, this film has a lot more going than what's on the surface. Add to the mix a very appropriate soundtrack of Bob Dylan songs (in particular, great use of ""Shelter from the Storm""), and you've got yourself an artistic treat.The dialogue is mostly between the 2 young figures, and I was surprised at how authentically child-like it was while figuring in some absolute pearls of wisdom. One of my favorite lines is what the girl says to the boy as they're wandering off into the night: ""You were right. There is no Devil. Just people.""The 2 young actors Kelly O'Neill (""Kylie"") & Shane Curry (""Dylan"") are, of course, what bring this film to life with a magical quality as only 2 genuine kids can display. It came as no surprise to me when I found out that these 2 were not actors. They were chosen from a bunch of kids that had been found at malls, schools and other such places. The result is a powerful film with a lot of honesty... not a pretentious art-house romp but an artistic film with real humanity.If you enjoy meaningful ""slice of life"" movies as seen through the eyes of kids, then definitely check this one out. Also be on the lookout for ""48 Angels"" about a young boy who wanders off in search of Jesus, ""Io non ho paura"" (""I'm not afraid"") about a boy who finds a deep hole where another boy is being held prisoner, the Wim Wenders classic ""Alice in the Cities"", and my favorite ""Kikujiro"" about a boy in search of his mother... accompanied by the grumpiest, foullest scoundrel in all of Japa"
21             ,pyrocitor,0,crime,2008,7,"Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold, it should come as no surprise that 21, a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers, and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable, it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student (Sturgess)'s desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However, this opening proves overlong, overly predictable, and largely unnecessary, dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing, clearing away such unnecessary subplots (such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends) could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. Some viewers may take offence to the ""Hollywoodizing"" of the MIT team, with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads, a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However, the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas, and once the film gets going, it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour, his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the ""troubled but well meaning hero"" archetype. As one might expect, Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team, and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance, but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role, she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class, much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security, gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here, 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film, but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However, fans of similar works will not be disappointed, and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity, 21 should prove an ideal watch.-7/10"
Mamma Mia!             ,trevorwynne,1,comedy,2008,1,"This is my second review of Mamma Mia as I now have had the chance to watch it as a movie rather than a screen version of the successful stage show.I think that being eager to have the distribution rights Universal gave Judy Craymer (the producer) a free reign to make the film as she wished. Ms Craymer, with no experience of films or filming, believed that she had an epic musical on her hands. She roped in her stage director, Phyllida Lloyd, who has never made a film before and had no idea how to transform the show from the confines of the theatre onto the big screen. She also roped in her stage choreographer and many other stage crew who also have no idea of the transformation from stage to big screen and the result is an amateurish production that relies totally on the ABBA feel-good factor and a participating audience.Ms Craymer's idea was to cast big-name stars who, despite the film being a musical, had no singing or dancing abilities. If that was not bad enough, she also hired a cinematographer who had problems getting the light correct and camera angles right. Everything about the film is terrible and an embarrassment to watch at times. The screaming girls at the beginning. Brosnan looking more like James Bond in drag. Julie Walters hopelessly over-acting. Meryl Streep and Christine Baranski behaving like girl guides on their first date, despite supposedly being mature women in their 40s or 50s. The ensemble who were more like young children in a school play than professional dancers. Even in their brief cameos, Benny and Bjorn grinned at the camera as though it was the first time they had ever been filmed. Catherine Johnson's lacklustre script that sounded more like a working class play ""We danced on the beach and kissed on the beach and dot dot dot!"" to quote a ludicrous example. Brosnan occasionally talking as if he was on the football terraces, particularly when he cheered Meryl on during 'Souper Trouper'. Did anyone check the continuity on the film, as there seemed to be so many disjointed examples particularly whilst Meryl Streep was singing 'Mamma Mia'. At the end when the main stars were dressed in spandex suits they could not contain their laughter. When Meryl sang the moving ""The Winner Takes It All"", she and Brosnan stood motionless whilst the camera whizzed around in the air. The ""Voulez Vous"" scene when you could not even work out what was happening on screen, as the camera angles were so erratic.Even though I have seen the stage show many times, I have no wish to buy the DVD when it is released, as the film was, to put in generously, nothing other than a disastrous amateurish production and probably the worst ever transformation of stage musical to screen. Doubtless, the crew, cast, distributors, financers and ABBA are not bothered. They still got their ""Money, Money, Money"" and are laughing all the way to the bank."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,two-cents,0,misc,2009,6,"I heard this movie was great, exciting, and gripping...and therein I was set up for disappointment. It was beautiful, cinematic, great sound track--but simply exhausting trying to understand all the relationships. After 45 mins, I stopped trying so hard to remember names and connections, the gestalt took over. That helped, but nevertheless without any familiarity of Italian politics, one really had to remember closely the framework that was outlined in the first five minutes. And similarly, there is a scene when his secretary describes what his hand movements mean--if he is tapping his fingers together, you will be dismissed within 5 mins, if he is playing with his ring, it means he is interested, etc....And then throughout the movie it shows his hands--but I couldn't remember the different meanings. It wasn't important, but what I am saying is that it's hard to know the forest for the trees--what IS important to pay attention to, and what isn't really essential. We found it very long because the storyline was rather vague and very gradual. The last 15 mins were excellent. This is a film made at a very high caliber, I just think the writers could have structured it a little differently. But this is 10 stars compared to most of what comes out of Hollywood. It was challenging but special"
One Missed Call             ,zardoz-13,0,horror,2008,8,"No, cell phones don't kill people in the creepy new supernatural nail-biter ""One Missed Call."" Instead, a vengeful ghost with a cell phone kills people. French director Eric Valette, who helmed the 2002 occult chiller ""Maléfique,"" makes his English-language film debut and shows strong visual flair with otherwise formulaic subject matter. Teaming up with scenarist Andrew Klavan, who penned the 1990 black comedy ""A Shock to the System,"" Valette and he conjure up a veritable buffet of chills in their atmospheric, above-average rendition of Takashi Mike's scary 2003 Japanese ghoulfest ""Chakushin Ari."" The original Asian horror film<U+0097>tame by Takashi Mike standards--ranks only a notch or two above Valette's sturdy remake. Valette's remake wraps things up about 30 minutes faster than Mike's original. A chilling cinematic experience in its own right, ""One Missed Call"" (*** out of ****) will give you more than enough goose bumps and make you dread the prospect of checking your cell phone voice-mail. Essentially, ""One Missed Call"" amounts to another of those damsels-in-distress epics, with Angelina Jolie look-a-like Shannyn Sossamon cringing as cell phones chime the same ringtone of death and the corpses stack up. ""One Missed Call"" opens with a great 'gotcha' moment. African-American babe Shelly (Meagan Good of ""D.E.B.S."") and her pet cat are relaxing in their backyard near a Japanese-style, goldfish pond when something stirs up the water. Inquisitive Shelly leans over the tranquil waters to see what is creating the disturbance. WHAM! She's toast! The kitty meows. WHAM! It's gone! Everything has to do with Shelly's cell phone. Like her friends Taylor (Ana Claudia Talancón of ""Fast Food Nation""), Leann (Drew Barrymore look-a-like Azura Skye of ""28 Days"") and Brian (Johnny Lewis of ""Underclassman""), Shelly received a voice-mail message that recorded the time of her impending death in the future. Grief-stricken Norton University psychology student Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon of ""A Knight's Tale"") finds herself up to her neck in dead bodies when she crosses paths with Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns of ""Saving Private Ryan"") who noses around the same crime scenes. Jack's sister, it seems, died under mysterious circumstances involving a cell phone. He discovered a red candy jaw-breaker in her mouth identical to similar candy extracted from the gullets of the other victims. Predictably, Beth demands that Jack let her accompany him on this occult outing. Things take a nasty turn in the last quarter-hour, and the conclusion leaves the film open to an inevitable sequel. Over the years, the cell phone has become the one virtually indispensable electronic gadget that everybody owns, so it was inevitable that horror movie makers would exploit this vulnerability with a haunted cell phone movie. In its weaker moments, ""One Missed Call"" imitates the ""Final Destination"" movies when the victims die. After a victim receives their voice-mail death message, they begin to hallucinate and see grey-face ghouls. ""One Missed Call"" qualifies as the kind of PG-13 rated suspense saga that scares the wits out of you rather than gross you out with gore."
Good Dick             ,garyml,1,misc,2010,10,I came across this film by accident. A very fortunate accident for me. The characters and the plot were very believable. I am a retired police officer having worked in the NYPD and in Colorado. I have met people like her and have spent a lot of time dealing with their issues. I was glued to my TV and when the film ended as I had watched one of the best films ever. The main plot was very well developed along with two or three sub-plots involving other characters. Culver City is filled with a lot of pseudo-intellectuals who all believe that they are somehow film experts and filled with all sorts of wisdom about life in general. This adds to the great direction as the viewer is watching life in that community as the main characters are developed.
Deception             ,tv00bjp,0,crime,2008,1,"Was looking for some decent after the bad '21' (how did that get to number 1 anywhere) and thought that this looked interesting from the trailer and since it had Hugh and Ewan i thought why not give it a shot. I couldn't have been more wrong.like we haven't seen the idea already in 'derailed' etc. Poor acting, poor script, clunky plot which didn't leave anybody guessing at all and still felt the need to spell out what was going on in big letters! rubbish. went to watch based on the two leads thinking they'd at least guarantee a decent film. very very very disappointed. The story was contrived and so unrealistic as to be laughable and during the first half hour or so there was actual laughs in the cinema. No tension since we didn't care about any of the characters, even Ewan was unlikable! "
Summer Hours             ,keenast,1,drama,2009,1,"This film, unfortunately is just another one of those sentimental and kitchy 'French' family dramas, bourgeois of course. With a camera that can't keep still for a second, that always has to follow one or the other person uttering platitudes over platitudes trying to inject 'energy' into a very very dead script. Not to mention the myriads of 'stories' told here - stories that are faster dropped and forgotten as one can count to two. There is absolutely no substance and sugar-coating will not make the cake taste any better.And before anyone starts pondering why the hell this film acts and looks like a commercial, here's the spill: it is a commercial. The 'work' was commissioned by Paris' Musee d'Orsay! Why a state-owned and tax-financed museum finds it has to go into the movie business doesn't even deserve a discussion - it's a bad joke. The bureaucrats in this museum - as one can see in this film - seem so utterly bored they think movie glamor is going to help them.A very sad tale indeed."
Flash of Genius             ,Chrysanthepop,0,misc,2009,NA,"I, for one, strongly oppose any kind of plagiarism because nobody has the right to steal someone else's work and claim it to be theirs. 'Flash of Genius' tells the heartbreaking story of inventer Dr. Kearns. While windshield wipers may sound like a small thing that hardly many give consideration to (as Kearns's friends have told him), it's not a matter of the object at hand but the effort that went behind it and why should credit go to somebody else? I admire Kearns for putting up a fight and keeping up the battle for justice and even though it cost him his family, he fought to the end. I'm surprised as to how little recognition 'Flash of Genius' received considering that the story is extremely relevant even for today's world.The director does a splendid job in telling this moving story. Greg Kinnear delivers a heartfelt lowkeyed performance which is among one of the best of his career. Unfortunately, he remains an underrated actor but I hope he keeps making the wise film choices and gets his due soon. Lauren Graham is wonderfully restrained and marvelous but she's risking getting typecast (she's played supportive wife in two other recent movies 'Evan Almighty' and 'Birds of America'). Dermot Mulroney too stands out as Privick. Where the technical department is concerned, the director has used a lot of subtlety with the cinematography, soundtrack and visuals. It is only later that we realize what an important symbol rain is in this movie. The washed out colour adds to the tense, stressful and sad atmosphere. 'Flash of Genius' is definitely a worthy watch not only because it tells an engaging story but a very relevant one."
Street Kings             ,dbborroughs,,misc,2008,6,"James Ellroy penned tale of a cop, played by Keanu Reeves, who is a loose cannon sent on the trail of the killer of his murdered partner. Protected by his captain because he can get things done and hounded by Internal Affairs, Reeves soon finds he is descending into a world that he really should not be part of. Reeves is okay, if a bit wooden as our antihero. Part of the problem is that he isn't given a great deal to do beyond allowing events to play out around him. To be certain he is a participant in events but there is a coldness to him that doesn't give a great many clues as to what is happening inside him. One would suspect he took the role because it offered him a chance to say some pithy lines, and behave in a more or less serious manner. The rest of the cast is quite good and one suspects that Forest Whitaker (as his boss) and Hugh Laurie (The Internal Affairs guy) took the roles because they got to play a bit against type. Good instead of great the films script, a long time in the oven, shows signs of being worked and reworked so much that the script becomes confused because too many hands lost track of what was going on. Rest assured that the central thrust and much of the dialog seems to be the work of Ellroy, the ending is most assuredly his in plot if not writing, but all of the details the additional writers have added have blurred what ever had attracted a long line of directors and stars to the project. Worth a look on DVD or cable where you're more likely to forgive the flaws."
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,faithq,1,adventure,2008,10,"Me, my husband and our two children ages 4 and 7 went to see this movie and we all had a great time! It kept everyone's attention for the entire length of the movie. It was hilarious, fast paced and heartwarming. I'm not sure why the movie got such bad ratings on here. I think people are being way too critical. The theater was full of couples without children, which was surprising to me, but it seemed like everyone enjoyed the movie and no one walked out!!! Before seeing the movie, I read the comments here and went into it with little expectations. I was happily surprised, enough so to take the time to register here at IMDb and state my opinion.

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,died_dead_red,,adventure,2008,NA,"Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely opposed to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star-laden premieres at Sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right."
Fireflies in the Garden             ,rajdoctor,0,drama,2008,6,"The movie was released with little publicity and it seems to be running with a low profile in Amsterdam.The story is about a writer Michael (Ryan Reynolds) who is about to finish his first autobiographical novel <U+0096> and he has come to attend the funeral of his mother Lisa's (Julia Roberts) death, who has a tormenting marriage with her husband Charles (Willem Dafoe) <U+0096> who is also abusive to his son Michael. The story goes back and forth with flashbacks and evolving relationship between Michael and Charles. There is a sub-plot of Michael and Lisa's sister Jane's (Emily Watson) childhood affair and Michael's relationship with Jane's son <U+0096> who feels isolated. In the end <U+0096> there is a get feel understanding between father and son. The movie ends there.The movie is good, but could have had been great. Ryan Reynolds looks fantastic, but Willem Dafoe steals the show with the negative role of father. Julia Roberts fits well in her small cameo as mother. While Emily Watson is good.The Director Dennis Lee has strong script and story line, but does not bring about the required finishing touch to the movie. The cinematography is excellent. The editing between current and flashback is very well handled. The movie was inspired from a poem (with the same name) written by Robert Frost and co-written by the Director Dennis Lee.Those people who have suffered child abuse by their disciplinary fathers would surely identify with the characters and may have tender moments <U+0096> that may make them cry.The movie does not become too heavy on the audience even though there are a few disturbing scenes.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,Ashley_The_Little_Rogue,1,adventure,2008,1,"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey was probably one of the best animal movie around, and everything that that movie was, this movie isn't. It isn't spectacular, it isn't breathtaking, it isn't adventurous, it isn't funny, it just goes to show how low Disney will sink to earn money from your children. Take it from me, I'm only 15 years old, and even I was holding my forehead with my hand and shaking my head, wondering: ""Why??... WHY?!"" It might be good for preschoolers who laugh at stupid jokes, but my goodness, I'd be surprised if this even makes 2 stars on the official ratings list. To put it all together, I not only want my money back, but I am going to torch this ticket in my fireplace tonight and forget all about it. @_@ 2"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,Saku_Tatsuya,1,misc,2008,1,"I honestly wish that I had seen the ""Dark Knight"" or at least ""Step Brothers""; seriously if you're going to the movies then see those films or the ""Star Wars Clone Wars"". But avoid this one at all costs; it will bore you to death.What's the plot? Unlike the first one, there was none worth mentioning in this one. Except for basically that Leena is bitchy about Kratos (I don't care if I spelled his name wrong; I hate the film too much to care) getting married to someone else, Carmen gets a major role in a play and her mother is pregnant, Bridgette goes to an archaelogical (sp?) trip then goes home to her grandmother then Tibby is being her usual bitchy self but this time she is worried about being pregnant with Brian's baby; and guess what? As predictable as it is, it turns out she isn't. But she ends up leaving Brian in anyway because ""she doesn't want to talk to him"" or some bullshit like that. But she ends up with him in the end; as I predicted.The characters are bland and annoying. Now in the first one, I liked Tibby. But in this movie she got really annoying; along with everyone else. The books just bored me to the core; but the movie was worse.I'm happy that I didn't spend my money on this trash; but I feel sorry for my mom because she did thinking that I would like because my stupid little sister does.Right now I really wish that I had a say in what movie to see; I would've automatically went for 'Step Brothers' because it's a comedy and I prefer comedies over chick flicks any day.At all costs, avoid this film"
The Strangers             ,lilwhitehand,,horror,2008,1,"This film is a turd of a turdwellian turdmeister to the turd power. Lets see, a lot of implausible stuff - baddies who can appear and disappear at will, one baddie maybe six feet tall the two others waifish and barely five feet tall against two healthily built people with a shotgun and a lot of magnum shells, victims who just don't want to lock their doors in the face of this sudden brutality, big open swaths of land outside their front door in which the victims could have fled in any number of directions and -o.k. o.k. no more. I guess the movie would have been over in twenty minutes if it tried to remotely approach a tiny little slice of believability.Me so tired of this type of film. Me bet newbies to the horror genre see this and think its the greatest achievement in a horror type thingy. When I think about this film I'm just amazed at how it really missed its mark. Sad thing or maybe the sickest thing is that I couldn't feel anything for the victims and did not care about their fates.Anything positive? Yeah. I got turned on to the sweet musical style of Joanna Newsome. If you can get something worthwhile from this movie than more power to you! Me go now."
W.             ,WoodrowTruesmith,0,misc,2008,2,"Instead of tearing W a new one, this film applied some Desitin, patted him on the back and said ""there, there."" I can't help but think that this, along with World Trade Center, represents a kinder, gentler, and newly boring Oliver Stone, focusing on inoffensive dramaturgy and lookalike casting (except Cromwell as Poppy Bush). It seems he now wants to be a Serious Prestige Director Who Gets An Oscar, rather than the passionate, irreverent wiseguy he was when he made his great films.So now Stone turns out a movie that will encourage any remorseful Bush voter to think, ""Well, of course I was right to have supported him...he meant well."" Give me a break.With the most stupidly corrupt leader in American history as his subject, a rage-filled, sadistic yet passive-aggressive antihero worthy of a blistering satire...Stone instead delivers a wet little Hallmark drama about how a cold daddy produced an unloved, frustrated child. Who just happened to kill a hundred thousand people (left almost entirely off screen, of course.) There are plenty of ironic laugh-lines for smug liberals, but they'll fly right over the heads of Republicans who can enjoy this shameless apologia free of irony.Where were the remarkable highlights (that is to say, low points) of Bush's public career? ""She said, 'please don't kill me' "", ""All right, you've covered your ass?"" ""F--k Saddam, he's going down,""...and ten minutes of lobotomized staring at a children's book...while America was under attack? Well, never mind history...you can't have your main character too unlikable, can you? For all the mentions of ""yellow cake"", you'd never know that phrase did not just refer to an unsupported claim, but to an obvious lie, a childish forgery that the CIA's own experts disclaimed...nor would you guess that Bush and Cheney stood accused of betraying the identity of the CIA agent whose husband pointed out this inconvenient fact (nor that Bush commuted the sentence of a convicted felon who might otherwise have testified to their treason.) To portray Bush and Cheney's worst crime as being just too darned vigilant is an outrageous libel upon history. (Just a reminder: ""you've covered your ass"" was W's reply to the CIA handler who tried to show him the Aug 6th memo, ""Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside U.S."")The leads are sledgehammered into a mold designed to produce relatable movie characters, instead of highlighting their most interesting facets. From watching the dewy-eyed, sensible, liberal, good-hearted gal called Laura Bush here, you'd never dream the genuine article actually told survivors of dead soldiers that ""no one suffers more than the president and I"" or that she once killed a boyfriend by running a stop sign.Oliver Stone - who once made a mainstream movie that accused the CIA of murdering JFK - wants us to believe Bush (who's been repeatedly photographed with wine-colored fluid in his glasses at state dinners and has fallen off bikes, Segways and his own two feet too often to count) passed out on a pretzel...with nothing but O'Doul's at hand? Really? Really?? Whatever happened to Oliver Stone?"
Deception             ,Lando_Hass,0,crime,2008,7,"I just watched Deception, and again, I really wasn't expecting that much from it. In fact, I really wasn't expecting anything in particular; I had absolutely no expectations for this movie. I didn't think it looked terrible, good, or average. I just thought it'd be worth a watch. And, overall, I thought it was worth a watch, but not much else. It's a good movie to see if you're bored one night and decide to just see whatever.One reason I was kind of intrigued by it was because I had this weird feeling that it might be an interesting movie kind of like The Prestige, even though the only connection these movies have is that they both star Hugh Jackman, and they both involve Hugh Jackman and another guy going up against each other. Obviously, it's nothing like that, but whatever. I figured the movie would at least be really thrilling and I thought it would have some really unpredictable twists and turns along the way. Honestly though, there's not really a single thing in this movie thats surprising. Not once did I say to myself as I was watching it, ""Wow, I didn't expect that."" Because I pretty much did expect everything. That's not to say it's a bad movie. It's pretty entertaining, but it's just not as good as it could have been.Ewan McGregor plays kind of a nerdy, shy accountant who one night meets Hugh Jackman's character (Wyatt Bose), a suave, kind of wild Wall Street-type guy who's pretty much the complete opposite of McGregor. Through a series of events, McGregor's character ends up with Jackman's cellphone, and he receives a call from a woman who asks him if he's free for the night. He meets the woman, and through another series of events, he gets caught up in this sex club where he calls random women in Bose's phone, getting together with them to screw them. The rule is that there's not supposed to really be any conversation, not getting-to-know-each other, and they're not supposed to know each other's names. They just get together for one reason only: To screw each other. Of course, Bose is not who he seems to be. There's something about him, and you already know that right off the bat. Eventually, McGregor's character meets up with a woman (her name's never given, it just starts with an S) that he falls in love with and cares for. Of course, things start to unravel, and Bose reveals that there's more to him than what he puts out. The sad thing is that you know what every character is going to do. You know what twists the movie is going to take, and you pretty much know how it's going to end. You know every step the movie's going to take, and because of that, it's not exactly thrilling or suspenseful. Bose's motive for doing what he's doing isn't predictable, but it just leaves you with a feeling of ""That's it?"" You expect there to be much more to the story and to Bose's motives, but there really isn't. It's like, it's not horrible, it's not good, it just leaves you thinking, ""That's alright, but that's it?"" Of course, the movie's full of sex...which means it's full of nudity. A bunch of gorgeous, hot women get naked for the camera, and it's pretty damn sexy. Just thought I'd point that out.The movie was entertaining, and it was made pretty well, but it could've been a lot cooler. It was really well made, the actors were good, Hugh Jackman's character was the villain, but he was really likable, they could've made it more suspenseful and they could've put some better twists in there, but whatever. I enjoyed it enough. But you're pretty much gonna see every single twist and turn a mile away if you go see it. Regardless of that, it's still a nice, solid movie. But eh. Go judge for yourself.Score: 7 out of 10."
The House Bunny             ,Anonymous_Maxine,1,comedy,2008,2,"There's a scene in The House Bunny where a key character inquires as to whether Shelley is, in fact, ""that dumb."" One of her fellow sorority sisters immediately stands up and says, indignantly, ""She's not dumb!"" This is an important scene, and my immediate assumption was that we, the audience, were meant to shake our fists at the screen and say, ""Yeah!"" But then I remembered that for well over an hour by then, the movie had been scrambling frantically to get us to laugh at how genuinely and spectacularly dumb she is.This is a contradiction that permeates the entire movie, with strange results. When I saw that scene, I was immediately relieved that I had found the movie up to that point so completely unamusing, otherwise I would have felt guilty for laughing at this girl, who, I understand, is ""not dumb.""So, in order to flaunt my superiority, I turned around in my chair and shook my fist at the drunk, cackling teenagers at the back of the theater and yelled, ""Yeah! She's not dumb! See? You little punks!"" Strangely, this only brought more laughter.The House Bunny, by the way, is PG-13, which should cause the majority of the male audience to lose interest entirely and confuse anyone over 17 as to why anyone would find such a movie interesting. The story is centered around the life of a Playboy bunny who is ousted from the Playboy mansion. Playboy's founder himself, Hugh Hefner, plays a sizable supporting role. Would one be out of line to expect a little gratuitous nudity? In this case, yes, because this is a soft porn movie for kids age 13 and up. Nice.The story is basically Legally Blonde in a sorority house, so it's obvious that the movie's message must have something to do with superficiality and obsessions over appearance and other such nonsense.Shelly, played by Anna Faris, is booted out of the Playboy mansion and finds herself homeless, so she decides to shack up with a sorority of uncool girls and teach them how to turn themselves into male fantasies.It's sad that the movie fails so completely because there is so much potential there, but, unfortunately, they just don't know where to stop with the cartoonishly overblown outcasts. These are not your typical college nerds, these are girls that don't know better than to walk up to some guys in a bar and say, ""Hey, where's the crapper? I gotta drop off some timber.""Timber!!!I feel like, in order for the comedy in a movie like this to be successful, we need to be able to point to a few characters and say, ""Hey I know someone like that!"" Not in this movie. You don't know anyone like anyone in this movie. But you have, however, seen people like the people in this movie.Remember that goofy teen comedy She's All That? One of the cool kids takes a bet that he can take the ugliest, most uncool girl in school and turn her into the prom queen. So we meet little Laney Boggs, the weird art student always covered in paint and unable to get a date to save her life. Zach, the cool guy choosing to accept the mission impossible, has his work cut out for him. But <U+0097> surprise! <U+0097> she takes off her glasses and combs her hair and she's hot! What a relief that the transformation was so easy!When we meet the girls of Zeta Alpha Zeta, they are genuinely frightening social outcasts. Bitter, confused by social interaction, and more clueless about fashion than your average homeless person, they are quite a spectacle to behold.But, surprise! Wouldn't you know it? With the addition of the right, ahem, outfits, a little hip hop bumping in the background, and just the right amount of slow motion, they're all crazy hot! Who would have guessed?Interestingly, it isn't until the very, very end of the film that you will truly realize how purely and incredibly meaningless it is. The movie is about Shelley's efforts to turn a group of social outcasts into frat party favors, but then it tries to feed us this message about not worrying about what other people think and just being yourself. What the hell?Beginning with the story about a Playboy bunny that just happens to be rated PG-13, everything in the movie cancels out everything else. There's a scene at the end that is meant to tie everything together and make it all make sense, but it is one of the biggest forehead slappers I've seen in recent memory.I've noticed lately, particularly with movies like Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder, that there are a lot of new things being done in the comedy world. The House Bunny is unsurprisingly unaware of these new ideas and experiments and is merely feeding us the same childish tripe we've seen countless times before. One can only hope that, since they are now resorting to a PG-13 Playboy theme, they must surely be running out of ideas<U+0085>."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,Jack_McSchmock,0,action,2008,1,"Nothing new to add here but personal sadness and disappointment: what a great franchise this was, what a lovable character, now destroyed by pure Lucasian incompetence. I'd really loved all the first three movies, because in my opinion, they were perfect examples for timeless adventure classics and movie magic extraordinaire, each in its own style. Indy himself was one of my childhood heroes ... heck, I even loved the TV series (well, mostly), but when I saw this one, I almost puked my guts out. Honestly, I wanted to like it badly, but this flick is so incredibly stupid, so inconsistent and amazingly badly written, it's plain unbearable. All things which made the other movies so great are missing: the excitement of discovery, the thrilling adventure, the enjoyable character relations, the sarcastic yet charming humor, the over-the-top but still believable action scenes - all gone. What remains is this brainless, soulless, uninspired load of junk that (sadly) will score at the box office anyway, just because it's Indy - sort of. But worst of all, as you can clearly see in almost every take, the love is gone from the franchise. Even Harrison Ford looks mostly like he's just going through the motions. For my part, I blame it all on the ABSOLUTELY SHITTY AND THOROUGHLY DUMB SCRIPT that 1) DENIES THE ACTORS ALMOST EVERY POSSIBILITY TO ACT (Karen Allen being the worst example) and 2) has literally everything that also made the star wars prequels fail: the ham-fisted dialogue, the completely ridiculous ""storytelling"", forced character development and relations, plot holes one could fly the death star through, overused CGI effects, the lamest humor imaginable ... the list goes on and on. So thanks, George Lucas, for ruining just another childhood love of mine - you couldn't have made it worse by introducing Steven Seagal as Indys long lost brother. But probably, that's what you were up to anyway and Spielberg just talked you out of it.Bottom line: 20 years of waiting in vain ... excuse me now, but I think I'll go hiding in the basement and cry a little. 3"
The Express             ,neilreed-585-255606,,misc,2009,1,"This film was not about Ernie Davis,this film was about Jim Brown. Using Mr. Brown as a source on this film was a mistake. The film save for a few notable scenes is mostly Hollywood fabrication. I pity Dennis Quaid ever going back home to Texas after his participation in this film! True facts of racism are one thing but to fabricate them for Hollywood are even worse. Read the true stories of Ernie Davis and you will see a much different person than the one depicted in this film. Ernie Davis described by teammates and fellow students paint a much different one than the one Jim Brown made up!Perhaps the directors should have just made a film about Jim Brown and his experiences with racism which he truly endured. There was none of the trash throwing, racism laced hate speech, and other racist events portrayed at West Virgina. There was a brawl at the Cotton Bowl in 1960 and Syracuse was asked to leave the after game awards ceremony but they went to the Dallas Athletic Club and had a great time according to players. Why does Hollywood always have to embellish the truth? If this movie had been about the true Ernie Davis it could have been a very nice piece of college football history! All of the living teammates agree this film was not the history or the Ernie Davis they remember! I believe them and the facts not this movie"
Julia             ,kathyprice,1,crime,2009,9,"This movie is about an alcoholic woman's transformation during a wild road trip. While I found the first 20 minutes hard to get through, and almost stopped watching, I found the remainder of the movie mesmerizing. Tilda Swinton is beyond amazing. You can't take your eyes off her. And you can't wait to see what will happen next as she digs herself deeper and deeper into a mess.Having said all that, there were major gaps in the story line. For instance, she was out of money, which is why she tried to pull off this stunt, so where did she get all the money she used on the trip? Did I miss something? With Thelma and Louise, they robbed the convenience store to get money. Julia needed to do something like that to explain her funds.The beginning was especially awkward as a nutty woman from an AA meeting approached Julia with a scheme to kidnap the woman's son from a guardian and get ransom. That whole proposal happened too quickly and was jarring. Then, what happened to that woman during the story? We never found out.I'm surprised to find so many things wrong with the story line and yet still give his movie a high rating. Swinton is that good. If you can get through the first bit, and suspend disbelief a little more than normal regarding plot, watching this woman's journey from a boozy barfly into a compassionate being is well worth the trip."
W.             ,greg-oswell,0,misc,2009,1,"Oliver Stone doesn't even bother to make an attempt at creating a realistic portrayal of GWB's life. He simply reviewed a few relevant historical facts and conjures his mental image of how the instances must have unfolded and films it.To be fair Josh Brolin does a better GWB impersonation than Will Ferrell but the script, as farcical as it is, is better suited to Ferrell's talents. The actors deserve credit for doing an admirable job in what can best be described as a Saturday Night Live version of the life of GWB.Entertaining as fiction but don't take it as historical fact.I am no fan of GWB but this film does not even attempt to make a fair portrayal of GWB's life.I would write more but this film doesn't warrant the effort."
The House Bunny             ,brianx-1,1,comedy,2008,9,"I gave this movie 9 stars out of 10 because it made me laugh, it made me laugh a lot, and I was still laughing after I left the theater. Anna Faris is a hoot, and you can't help but love her. (She's the Goldie Hawn of the early 2000's)Everyone else in the movie ends up loving her because she's the epitome of goodness and loving. Even tho the movie is basic in it's good people vs their antagonists it works, and it's not meant to do anything but entertain, amuse, and make you laugh. I was expecting a rehashed Animal House, but it's not that at all. It's a feel-good movie all the way. Forget all the Summer comic book fare and go see this one, you will not regret it and you'll feel a lot better than after having seen The Dark Knight, I assure you!"
Gomorrah             ,umar_n12,,crime,2008,4,"Well this was a let down. It was reviewed SO well, and it looked great, but in the end I spent two hours (more?) being categorically bored. I mean at first it looked really good. Well acted and directed, and I could tell it was building up to something. Obviously. Why? WELL: Essentially there were four or five separate plot threads, all of which centered (mainly) on the crime in a certain part of Italy. A kid, two teenagers and a bunch of others. And they were good actors. And it was filmed in a very realtime, 'you're there' manner. Pretty good. But in a film like this, you expect the individual plot threads to clarify themselves, develop and perhaps converge. But no. The characters had no real arcs, had no *point* really. It was just things happening! And the ending! It just finished. Simple as. No one came off for better or worse, no one really did anything. After all the reviews, even though I was bored two or so hours in, I thought the ending must be amazing. Has to be. Nope. Just one thread ends, the others aren't revisited. Then there are a bunch of stats about the reality behind the film. I would have preferred to just see those and walk out.The thing is if they just wanted to display the effect of crime in the area, they certainly did it. And did it well. It was like a cross- section of what's happened there. But that's the thing. As a film it doesn't work. If I'm just sitting there for two hours, having paid eight pounds I want to get involved with the characters, I want to care about them. I don't want to see random events, dotted in nothingness. This display of crime doesn't work as a feature length film, it's better to read factually as a book. At least then I would know what I'm getting into.And the place didn't sell popcorn until 1.30, and I saw it at 12. 15. Bloody hell."
Milk             ,Doug-193,0,misc,2008,NA,"Let's get one thing out of the way. Is it entertaining? And how! Sean Penn's best performance to date <U+0096> Oscar quality; Emile Hirsch riotously perfect (best ""supporting?""); James Franco heartbreaking; Diego Luna, devastating; Josh Brolin, flawless. Not one false note in any of the actors <U+0096> a very complicated story unfolds with absolute clarity. I will be seeing this one again just for the screenplay. I was very gratified that no attempt is made to be ""delicate"" about Harvey Milk's personality, either his sex life or his out-sized ego, which perhaps ironically for some, makes him all the more heroic. The finest ""political"" film I think I've ever seen. It does more than dramatize a strong true story, it captures convincingly the truth about a whole political movement. (One that's as freshly active as today's headlines: Prop 6 or Prop 8 <U+0097> does it ever end?) There is an ease and familiarity to the ""scene"" <U+0097> to the historical period and place <U+0097> with very few, small anachronisms, as far as I could tell. This is also the most assured work of Gus Van Sant, a genuine film artist, who here delivers a complete drama with real visual style and brazen wit. The blending of documentary footage is the most seamless I can remember seeing anywhere. The crowd scenes are remarkable, and all of the location shooting miraculously right. For a couple of fast, fast hours, I felt as though I had spent a couple of days <U+0097> hilarious, intense, inspiring days <U+0097> immersed in 1970s San Francisco. This movie does what all movies should do. See it. 1"
Mamma Mia!             ,Buddy-51,1,comedy,2008,5,"Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - ""Waterloo,"" ""SOS,"" ""Fernando,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled ""Mamma Mia!"" in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of ""Mamma Mia!,"" written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.The story takes place on a beautiful Greek island where the never-married Donna (Meryl Streep) single-handedly runs a modest hotel for an ever-thinning crowd of tourists. Her daughter, Sophie (the charming Amanda Seyfried), has never known who her real father is, mainly because Donna herself doesn't even know. With the help of her mother's diary from twenty years ago, Sophie narrows the candidates down to three (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard), then secretly invites them to her wedding in the hope that she will be able to figure out which of them is her real father in time to have him accompany her down the aisle.On stage, ""Mamma Mia!"" succeeded primarily because it was able to keep its wafer-thin storyline modest in scale and life-sized in scope. But blown up to the magnified proportions of the big screen, the material becomes a compendium of overacting (Julie Walters being the most egregious culprit in that regard), ham-handed literalization, forced spontaneity, and production values that look both gaudy and chintzy at one and the same time. Moreover, the direction is clunky, the choreography abysmal (especially compared to what we were treated to in ""Hairspray"" just a year ago), the photography either over or underexposed (depending on whether the scene is set at night or during the day), and the singing not unlike what one might hear emanating from the local pub on an average karaoke-night.In fact, there has always been an inherent problem built into ""Mamma Mia!,"" which is that much of ABBA's charm derives from the crystalline voices of its lead singers, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog. Take away those harmonies and at least a certain percentage of that charm is lost. Now the movie version of ""Mamma Mia!"" comes along and simply compounds the problem by hiring big-name actors rather than trained singers to somehow interpret the pieces for us. Indeed, this must be the only musical in movie history made up almost entirely of people who can't sing (at least in the old days they used to dub the voices in if they had to). One has to give Streep brownie points for at least trying to belt out the tunes, but her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All,"" which was the rafter-rattling showstopper in the stage version, falls flat due not only to her own inadequacies as a vocalist but to the awkward staging and foolish hand gestures she uses to accompany her singing (almost as if she were trying to act out the lyrics as she's singing them). Actually, I've never understood why anyone would buy either the original cast recording or the soundtrack to ""Mamma Mia!"" anyway when the real thing is readily available and clearly far superior to any imitation.All that being said, I am still inclined to at least half-heartedly recommend that people go to see this movie for a number of reasons. First, because the music itself (written by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus) is fun, infectious and finally irresistible, no matter how much the singers may be unintentionally stomping all over it; second, because even though their singing leaves much to be desired, Streep, Bosnan and Seyfried somehow make us care about the characters and the silly little predicament they're caught up in; and third, because there are a number of scenes that actually work quite nicely, the best being when Donna sings the sweet mother's lament ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" (a song clearly within Streep's limited vocal range) to her soon-to-be-wed daughter. Streep and Seyfried are both very moving and poignant not only in that particular scene but in all of the scenes in which they appear together.For the half dozen or so audience members who aren't already familiar with the ABBA oeuvre, one can only hope that they will use ""Mamma Mia!"" as a springboard to sampling the real deal. 1"
Yes Man             ,mitchlax14,0,comedy,2008,7,"I saw this movie as a early showing and having gotten the tickets for free I said ""what the heck, I'll see anything for free"". So right off the bat I went in with low expectations. The previews made it look like the same old Jim Carrey Schtick. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There was no ridiculous plot line (Liar Liar) or over the top characters (Ace Ventura) but a simple yet humorous story-line that is played to perfection by Carrey. There were plenty of good chuckles to be had and some down right laughs (and yes for those into it, a gross out scene that will make even this amazingly desensitized movie going generation cringe).Overall, Yes Man is definitely worth the 10 bucks or so that movies are now ridiculously priced out now a days. But most definitely worth the trip if its free :-p. *7/10* "
Igor             ,Mightyzebra,0,animation,2009,8,"I enjoyed ""Igor"" because its messages, humour, the characters, the cast chosen and the CGI was terrific. The messages explain that we all can be evil, but we do not have to be evil and can make our own decisions - an incredibly good message that all too few people in this world seem to grasp. The humour can be dark and slapsticky some of the time, but there are a great deal of very entertaining one-liners. The characters are all likable, even the baddies (the most featured baddie, voiced by Eddie Izzard, is extremely good and mainly because of Izzard). All of them are well-planned and have an important part in the film. The cast chosen were very good, including the comics Eddie Izzard (mentioned earlier) and John Cleese (he hardly appears, but is an important character). The CGI is almost always dark, a sort of creepy purplish colour. All of the characters, objects and places in the film are well- animated. While they do not look realistic, they still look impressive.In ""Igor"" (which is based on Frankenstein), we come to the kingdom of Malaria, where everything is evil and the sun never shines. In the kingdom are a group of evil scientists who make evil, destroying inventions each year for the annual evil science fair. The scientists have hunchbank servants, all called Igor. There is one Igor who is slightly different from the rest. He wants to be more than just another ""Igor"", he wants to be an evil scientist. He has already created an immortal rabbit (who does not want to live) and a robot with a big brain - a rather idiotic brain, I hasten to add. Will Igor manage to live up to his dreams, and create an invention to win the science fair..?I recommend this fun, watchable film to people over the ages of 8 (this may look like a children's' film, but some children might be scared easily by this film, as there are a few gruesome bits), to people who like madcap creepy fantasy films and to people who like CGI animation. Enjoy ""Igor!"" :-)"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,ozar_33-1,1,misc,2008,5,"In the first adaptation of Ann Brashares's famous novel series, soap-opera clichés and predictable story lines were defeated by the sheer charm of the characters and their relationships with one another. And whereas that film dealt with the transition to womanhood and celebrating feminine diversity, the sequel fits our young heroines into contrived, ""after-school"" special story lines that end exactly the way you'd expect them to. The first film is by no means a masterpiece, but there was a genuine sense that these characters were real and thus we could relate to their plights. There are some moments in the sequel that shine, most of them occurring when the four titular characters are together, but so much time is spent on filler plots and unnecessary contrivances that the film simply gets old too quickly. Alexis Bledel and Blake Lively don't do much to make their characters any more believable or human; they have no personality and thus their individual story lines are rendered even weaker. Amber Tamblyn and America Ferrera do the opposite, and bring their characters to life, against the odds of the mediocre script. There's also some impressive input from supporting performances, such as the great Blythe Danner and the heartfelt Shohreh Aghdashloo. All in all, a disappointment considering the first film, but still a somewhat worthy escape with four friends who, in the end, above all things, value one another more than anything else in the world."
Four Christmases             ,isewthe-2,1,comedy,2008,1,"My husband and I attend a movie at least three times a month and I believe we have a good sense of humor, but this was the most humorless movie we have seen in a long time. I laughed more at the new Kevin James movie preview than I did at this movie. It was so bad my husband almost went to sleep during it. I kept hoping something really funny would happen, but it never did. I feel like Reese Witherspoon was wasted in this movie. I have loved most of her movies, but she should have bowed out of this one. As for Vince Vaughn I keep wondering why he is so popular. Also the scene in the church was disgustingly bad and for those who know the true meaning of Christmas it was an insult."
Julia             ,kosmasp,1,crime,2008,6,"Not only Tilda S. for taking on this role, but especially her. She goes all out for this role and I'd even go so far saying, that her performance is worthy a ""Daniel Day Lewis"" award (that's a joke, but I hope you get my point).While I really loved her character at the beginning, it began to tumble and went kinda downwards from a certain point of the movie. Which all comes down to the really unlikeable ""Julia"" (main character). The problem is that not only couldn't I identify with her, from a certain point onwards I despise her. That also comes down to some of her choices, which I won't go into, because that would be spoiling the story.Apart from Tilda, you have a few other great actors in this too. But as good as they are, they never overshadow the failings of the main character. Of course this was meant to be that way, but I couldn't like the movie as much as I'd love to, just for this simple fact."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,lastliberal,0,crime,2010,NA,"It is happening again. A film is a hit and Hollywood remakes it. Watch the original before they do that.Henrik Ruben Genz directs this film (and will direct the remake) that has been compared to a Coen brothers film. The synopsis is simple - Hot Fuzz in Danish, but a noir, not a comedy, even though it is funny at times.Jakob Cedergren was great as the cop sent to a small town for his transgressions, and who got himself into a bigger mess with Lene Maria Christensen. She was also extremely good, as was her husband, played by Kim Bodnia.What a great ending"
Space Chimps             ,helluvacopter,,animation,2008,2,"After the first ten minutes of this movie I knew I was in for a long 90 minutes. The opening sequence was nothing great, and the aliens looked like a cross between Boobah's and oompah loompahs! Andy Samberg (as Ham the third) has a couple funny moments, but the comedy for the most part is truly horrible one liners that you'd expect to hear on an unpopular Cartoon Network show. Patrick Warburton (who I've always found funny, ever since his Putty days on Seinfeld) is a bit type-casted here as the burly but dumb guy (or chimp I should say), and not really funny at all in the movie.I think the biggest surprise to me was Jeff Daniels as the enemy alien. How did he stoop to this level?? Not that I'm a huge Jeff Daniels fan, but he just didn't seem to fit the rest of the cast at all.I actually don't remember the last time I was at a movie with my wife and we both looked at each other at least three times rolling our eyes at the corny, almost embarrassing ""jokes"" in this movie.I will say that my 5 year old and 8 year old loved it and insist that we will buy it on DVD when it comes out (which shouldn't be too long considering it's flopping). So, the kids will love it, but don't expect to have a good time at this one"
Julia             ,ozyvort,1,crime,2016,2,"There are good qualities to this film, and from the standpoint of technical virtues it is arguably outstanding (filmography, music, acting, settings, costumes, film editingto name a few). However, the humanistic dimension is deplorable, with bad behavior being exalted beyond belief and all seemingly free from any consequencesto the extent I felt evil was being promoted as the way to live. The very loud message of the film: go ahead and smoke, drink, sell your body, back up over someone standing behind your car, kidnap, steal cars, kill a man by shooting at his head at short range, leave a child with murderers, etc (this list is far from exhaustive). Do all this and be certain that because you finally demonstrate some modicum of regard for a boy and his mother, you will never be punished in any way. This film should be Exhibit A when arguments about the immorality of Hollywood are mad"
Prom Night             ,BeEmKay90,1,horror,2008,1,"I doubt there's much question to this movie being technically terrible. I mean this movie epitomizes cliché in all the wrong ways. From the not-so-clever scare tactics (i.e. cinematic tension unfolding into either a jolt or a joke) to the clear as day plot twists. It ripped off all the classic slasher flicks failing to amount to them whatsoever. I'm not saying that Scream was good, but this is like a carbon copy of Scream minus the strategic comic relief and plus some awkward, cardboard acting and poor attempts at getting a laugh. There is little doubt that this movie is an abysmal failure.Then why say success? The one thing that this movie delivered with incredible success only applies to a certain target audience. Those are the 11-13 year olds who are simply excited to have gotten into a 14A movie and will be bombarded with, for some, their first ""horror"" movie experience. It gives them all they want: blood, twists, jolts, tension, and of course kissing. They can't tell a bad slasher flick from a Tarantino masterpiece. Not because of their age, however, but because they just haven't been exposed to enough 14+ movies in order to have a well developed movie sense. It's a good experience for them, a benchmark, if you will. I may have hated the movie, but all the twelve year old screams and laughter in the theater made me think that maybe it was worth it to make a horror so mind numbingly terrible for the sole purpose of appealing to those young ones. Revisiting the Scream days, but with less prowess.oh, and financially, it was a great success as well. This probably due to the massive influx of underage movie goers.A success. An abysmal success, but a success nevertheless."
Space Chimps             ,Roadblock67,,animation,2008,4,"i went into this movie blind. i had seen the trailer once and had not heard any critiques on it. i think Space Chimps won't set any benchmarks as a great animation flick - it was only so-so. to greamamerican, you've completely confused me by saying the first 30 minutes was boring, but in the same post you say you left after 10 minutes. numbers don't add up there bud. but that aside, you have to give the movie a chance. no, it won't grow on you - and more than likely you'll leave as i did thinking 'something was missing'. yes, the main character Ham can be extremely annoying and Titan seems like a recycled Buzz Lightyear but... what am i saying there is no but - this movie was not good. save it for a rental on family movie night - but don't spend your hard earned cash at the theater to see it."
35 Shots of Rum             ,rpavly,0,drama,2010,NA,"A long, pretentious and boring mess, ending in a mushy inexplicable scene set up only to get the title worked into the film. It goes nowhere... mostly because it hardly has a plot, it is just enigmatic observations.Denis's strives for realism and humanism; but the only rare viewer can possibly identify with the film due to its purposely vague non-plot. Or to its characters who are just living their mundane lives. This film uses a manipulative narrative structure and its characters are mostly connected by lifeless staring or slight movements. The character development is nothing more than an hour and a half of watching them perform the most trivial and mundane of tasks. Nothing much happens. And the scenes in which nothing much happens drag on endlessly. This slice of life film was far less enjoyable than a slice of soggy pizza."
One Missed Call             ,demon-monkey,0,horror,2008,7,"I know that many people have given this a low rating but I believe that is mostly because many people had preconceptions before watching the movie because of the original Japanese version/origin and the fact that it was a remake. O.k granted it isn't the best movie of all time but far from the worst if you watch it as I did with an open mind and give it a chance under it's own merits. There were several parts in the movie where it does get you guessing and thinking that you know who is behind it but you may guess wrong - I know that I did, o.k it wasn't overly scary but a few moments where it does make you think now that would be freaky, you can see a few holes in the plot but then again you can with most movies.All in all worth a watch with an open mind if you don't really expect anything from it and give the movie a chance!My rating 7/10"
Frost/Nixon             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,misc,2008,NA,"The Frost/Nixon interviews are fascinating. Not every second of them, especially not when Nixon rambles on and on, avoiding questions by offering anecdotes in place of answers. Yet, they are an invaluable historical document, which allow us the rare privilege of seeing a major politician as a human being and nothing else. As interesting as the interviews themselves is the lead-up to them, the circumstances surrounding them, and the characters involved, particularly Frost and Nixon, of course. One could say that you only need to watch the actual footage, but there's ample room for a great dramatization, but it needed an even-handed approach, and certainly needed no political preaching.I have a personal dislike for Ron Howard as a director, a result of my sensibilities mainly, I suspect. Howard strikes me as a particularly heavy-handed, didactic director who has wasted many great concepts on mediocre films (out of 18 films I've seen by him, I only genuinely liked ""Apollo 13"". I was expecting the worst with ""Frost/Nixon"", but instead was met with one of the most entertaining films in a while, and a remarkably well-acted, even-handed, quality character study. I suppose I should have been prepared for a quality screenplay given the success of this Peter Morgan play in New York and London, but I was hardly expecting something this good. It's glib, funny, well-paced, expertly-structured, clever, observant, and intelligent. It creates a fascinating Nixon, played brilliantly by the great Frank Langella, though this is not quite up there with the likes of Oliver Stone's sadly under-appreciated ""Nixon"" or Robert Altman's endlessly fascinating ""Secret Honor"". The film is almost surprisingly well-directed, although there is a bit of the old TV trick of shaking the camera a bit, panning too often, to give the illusion of motion and energy when there's really just people in a room talking. The conversation's interesting enough, there's no need for that. Oh well, I suppose I am nitpicking.As far as Nixon movies go this is lightweight entertainment with plenty of comic moments largely leading up to two or three scenes of real human vulnerability. Aside from these scenes (which are truly, truly excellent), Peter Morgan conceives the meeting as something of a chess match with the unpredictability of a boxing match. To use J. Hoberman's words 'a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win'. On paper this could have been very heavy on amateur psychoanalysis and low on entertainment value but Morgan and I suppose Howard as well are clever enough to have some fun with the idea. This is not a criticism at all, the film has moments of surprisingly real depth and intellectualism, but overall the nature of the script works in its favor, makes those scenes more interesting, more ultimately rewarding.""Frost/Nixon"" is an entertaining, exciting film, around as populist as I expected but in a very different way. This is the sort of writing we don't see enough of, particularly not in today's films. It's vaguely reminiscent of a particularly good BBC television drama. The cast is certainly good enough for that. Langella and Michael Sheen are outstanding, both manage to accurately portray the real-life men they are portraying while still adding some characterization and mannerisms of their own. Langella's Tony-award winning performance might be up for Oscar consideration soon, but Sheen's Frost almost upstages him at times. No heavy-handedness, no political 'messages', just a fun, clever script and a great cast in a well-made film. 1"
Four Christmases             ,adnil-2,1,comedy,2008,1,"I thought this one had promise.Yet, I almost walked out in the first 15 minutes to ask for my money back. Unfortunately, I stayed until the end.This movie was not funny at all. It had bad acting (from people who really should have known better and who, in other films, actually show that they do have some talent - you wonder why they even wanted to associate themselves with this one). It was a waste of my time and money.I was really hoping for a good Christmas movie to get in the mood for the holidays. This one wasn't it."
Fireflies in the Garden             ,napierslogs,0,drama,2012,3,"""Fireflies in the Garden"" is one of those rare movies where a stellar cast and script based on a Robert Frost poem (!) could not get itself a release. Four years later, it got a straight-to-DVD release. And for good reason, it's really bad. It's a dysfunctional family drama where the characters are messed up from beginning to middle to end. There is no relief, comedy or otherwise, from the dysfunction.It starts with the guise that perhaps it's not dysfunctional from the very beginning, but no, it is. I made the mistake of reading the back of the DVD case, where I was informed that the Taylors are the very picture of a happy and successful American family. I wonder what constitutes a successful family: Is it the father emotionally and physically abusing his son? Or the husband emotionally and physically abusing his wife? Or the inappropriate relationship between aunt and nephew? Because all of that was conveyed to us in the first two scenes. Not from the very first minute did I confuse this family as a happy and successful one.The film also implies that the family wants to get out from their past and start afresh. Whether they want to or not, that's not going to happen because they don't even know what a happy and successful family looks like let alone how to be one.The now grown up son, Michael (Ryan Reynolds) has returned home along with his sister and aunt and father (Willem Dafoe). Michael is a writer because it's the classic profession to be able to rid yourself of past demons. I was expecting a sort of mystery to develop as the film certainly did imply that each character was hiding something. Of course they were hiding things  repressed emotions. Which doesn't build to a mystery but melodrama.The title refers to the Frost poem but also one of their childhood activities. Along with everyone I know, on warm summer evenings when the fireflies would be out in their brilliant glory, we would catch them in jars, keep them in our bedrooms, trying to savour the magic of the night. But not the Taylor kids. On warm summer evenings when the glowing fireflies were out, they would go and kill them. Any sympathy was instantly lost, never to be regaine"
Shutter             ,Mark-129,0,horror,2008,9,"Before I reviewed this American remake of a highly regarded Thai horror film from 2004, I ordered a copy of the original to make a comparison.Although the original is superior, the remake, to be fair smooths out some of the inconsistencies of the tale. This is not always a good thing as it's these little things that give the story a bit of character and individuality.To be brief, the story involves the haunting of an American photographer and his new wife in Japan after hitting a young woman with their car on a lonely country road.Most of the ghostly horror is more suggested than overt, with images appearing in photographs and just out of direct sight. Most of the set pieces from the original are here, but several of the most startling and effective moments of horror are missing. The unfortunate PG-13 rating keeps everything in check, so, while compelling, the horror is fairly muted. Another fault is the ghost lacks a bit of the personality the original has in spades. The final twist takes the story in a very different direction and is quite startling. But, like another reviewer wrote, leaves you feeling justice has been done.Not a great film, but very watchable and satisfying."
The Incredible Hulk             ,BiiivAL,0,action,2018,8,"History.In the sixties, the company made tremendous progress, as it was during these times that such characters as Iron Man, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, X-Men and many other heroes were created who are still considered to be the main stars of the vast Universe Marvel.Finished work on the first series of comics about the Fantastic Four, Stan Lee began to look for something completely new and different. Then Lee remembered that one day he really liked the movie ""Frankenstein"" (1931), then in the makeweight remembered another masterpiece - ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (also in 1931 the year of release).Crossing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Frankenstein Stan Lee got the monster he needed: a terrible outside, good inside (which, moreover, could turn from a man into a monster and vice versa). Originally, Lee made the Hulk gray (he explains that the Hulk is a monster, he must frighten, and gray is a suitable color). But when the first edition was printed, it turned out that the shade changes from drawing to drawing. Therefore, it was decided to find a different color. Thinking about what color a superhero did not yet exist at that time, the thought came that no one had thought of making a character green, and Stan decided to ""Be to him Green!"". So the Hulk became as We know it today.So, May 1962 was marked by the release of a new character from Lee Incredible Hulk and his ""second self"" - Doctor Bruce Banner ...Actors and Heroes.Edward Norton (Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Incredible Hulk) - I think that Norton has already come across such a split (meaning ""Fight Club"", whose main character suffers from a split personality and tries to get rid of his ""companion"" in the course of the film).At first glance it may seem that the Hulk is a very primitive character, just an evil monster and nothing more. But everything turns out to be not so simple because there are remnants of human memories in his head (that's why he did not touch Batty and defended her). Part of the Hulk hates Bruce Banner, because for him he is only a miserable nonentity, while the Hulk is an invincible force and power. He constantly feels a split.Probably this is the case when superpower is not a gift, but a curse. The tragic side is manifested when the Hulk again becomes Bruce, and sees the destruction that he did (in the film - this is the destruction of the laboratory at the time of the first transformation of Banner). Then his conscience and guilt tell him that this monster can not be released, and the Doctor consciously goes into exile. Edward Norton is a wonderful dramatic actor, his game conveys the feelings of a lost person: alienation, anguish and grief - the real Dr. Bruce Banner.Liv Tyler (Betty Ross) - like Norton, Liv had a similar role - Arwen (The Elf from the movie ""The Lord of the Rings""): the same deep feelings and the same ""forbidden love"", in general, everything is very sad. In Hulk, she plays a strong, and at the same time sincerely loving woman who is ready to fight for her happiness; she is the embodiment of true love. And the way Tyler transmits emotions is really beautiful. In the film, Liv Tyler treats the Hulk as Naomi Watts with King Kong; and the Hulk itself is very similar to Kong: calms down at the sight of his caring beloved, protects her from all the dangerous (and not thinking about his own self-preservation). What more can be said? God grant more such loving women.Tim Roth (Emil Blonsky aka Abomination) - he plays Russian, who grew up in England and became a soldier (who, moreover, does not drink vodka and does not wear a hat with a fur hat!). He leads a group of professionals gathered to catch Bruce Banner. However, after the friend saw what the Hulk is, he immediately became fired with the desire ""I want the same!"".During the film, Blonsky is injected with the serum of the super-soldier, after which he becomes very fast, strong and enduring. It seemed that he got what he wanted, but after the Green Giant had made a cutlet from him with one blow of his foot - Emil realized that he did not have enough, and he wants more (and eventually achieves it). And what is most surprising is not to take over the world and rule it (like most super villains); but in order to fight properly. If we talk about the actor - then Roth like his hero is very charismatic. The game is good, not fake. Tim in a beautiful form: in his 47 so quickly run and participate in battle scenes - is respected. In general, Tim Roth disproved the opinion of the Coen brothers and Cormac McCarthy; ""Old people"" here is the place!Special Effects.Special effects in the movie a lot. I will not talk about the visualization quality of the Hulk: now, with the modern development of computer graphics, there is simply no need to talk about it, especially with a company like Universal Pictures (which, in my opinion, always wins in quality, both computer graphics and special effects in whole).If you care, you know: everything is fine, muscles are throbbing, hair is developing in the wind, drool from the mouth flying at crying, clothes are bursting; The Hulk runs, jumps and fights, as befits - really. The explosions themselves, the launch of cars and tractors into each other is done at 5+. All the laws of physics were observed: there will not be a Hulk like in the movie Enga Lee fly like a dandelion: he weighs decently for a mountain of muscles and generally a three-meter bald, so that he will fall swiftly and powerfully.The battle of the two giants can not be called otherwise simply as a fierce fight, all the tools at hand are used: stones, bricks, cars (the Abomination still used people) - in general, everything is beautiful, beautiful, incredible!The result.""Incredible Hulk"" - the second film Marvel Studios. A wonderful cast, good special effects, great sound, not only could one enliven one of the best comics, but also create an incredible film!

Prom Night             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,horror,2008,2,"When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.Donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are. Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG-13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.2/10"

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,nogodnomasters,,adventure,2018,NA,"Art (Jon Foster) works at the Book Barn by choice as he studies for his exams. His dad (Nick Nolte) is a crime boss who has a job lined up for Art who lacks assertiveness. Phlox (Mena Suvari) is his boss and sex partner at the Book Barn. He meets Jane (Sienna Miller) at a party and they hit it off. She is athletic, sexy, charming, talented, and drinks to excess. She also has a boyfriend, Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) ""like the state"" who we soon find out is bisexual. The three of them start hanging out together.The first thing you notice is the annoying narration by Art because they couldn't make a decent screen adaptation. The characters of Art and his dad were poorly constructed. When they got together, you just wished the scene would be over. Jane is an interesting character who we never got to know, and Cleveland is a character we perhaps learned too much about. This is a story of Art trying to find himself one summer in Pittsburgh. For hard core indie lovers and clearly not my cup of tea, but an offering that might go good with ""Milk"".F-bomb, sex (straight and gay), and nudity (Mena Suvari"
Pathology             ,zu20,1,crime,2008,7,"Opening extremely effectively with a section of the Hipoccratic oath this film concerns itself with an excellent medical student Ted (Milo Ventimiglia) who finds himself steadily drawn further and further into a group with murder as a hobby.I found this a pleasingly disturbing film.The themes running through it were intense and adult - sex and death confronted repeatedly from many different angles (so to speak). Immediately it confronts the viewer with the harsh, hideous realities of death, then sets about vividly preying upon fears the world has about what happens to the dead at the hands of the living. Then it smoothly descends into something more disturbing still - a comment on the arrogance of doctors and the living in general.The acting here really is pretty good, especially from Michael Weston and it has to be to make any of these totally repellent, morally void human beings(or morally hypocritical in the case of Ted) charming or likableIt succeeds in that I was carried along by the film but by the end I felt a bit dirty.There is just little light or moral centre in this film and whilst that isn't necessarily a drawback, in the sense that the characters seemed a little bit more real in this than they might have otherwise it makes the whole experience heavy going because there is no one at all to root for."
"Surfer, Dude             ",uggachucka,0,comedy,2008,1,"I just arrived home from this movie. It was such a disappointment and non stimulating experience I don't recall leaving the house. Sure I went to admire the Matt man, yet we some how broke into uncontrollable laughter when his pearly butt arrived on the screen. I am still seeing spots from the over whitened teeth which managed to steal the scenes. The movie appeared a desperate attempt to capitalize on the hotness that was Matt, the excellence of bill and Ted, the reality TV addict, the gamer, tech buff, t&a specialist, booty watcher, country music fan and those still waiting for the legalization of Marijuana. We waited too and unlike the movie the waves never came. If I were Matt or Woody I would pull the movie, before waves of bad reviews pull them under.

The Lucky Ones             ,Wuchakk,,adventure,2012,9,"See this film.""The Lucky Ones"" (2008) is a true hidden gem. I wasn't expecting much when I put the DVD in my player but before too long I knew I had stumbled on to something great.THE PLOT: Three soldiers coming back from Iraq meet at JFK in NY where all flights are delayed due to a blackout. One soldier is older and getting out of the Army for good (Timothy Robbins), one has a serious groin injury and is trying to heal-up (Michael Pena) and the other is on leave to visit the family of a dead comrade (Rachel McAdams). They end up in a rental vehicle traveling across the country where they experience many sides of American culture and each other's deepest secrets, hopes and pains.All three stars have great chemistry and Rachel McAdams (who I've never seen in a movie before) is a total revelation as Colee. Although Colee isn't highly educated she's not dumb. In fact, she excels socially and is the catalyst to hope and healing for the other two. A more beautiful, spunky, stimulating woman could hardly be found! Both Timothy Robbins as Cheaver and Michael Pena as TK shine in their roles as well. Cheaver becomes the necessary father-figure in the trio and the others become increasingly concerned about the well-being of their temporary ""dad."" The film features a good balance of Eastern and Western locations, shot in Illinois, Missouri, Colorado and Las Vegas.FINAL WORD: I don't want to say anymore. If what I said perks your interest, be sure to check out ""The Lucky Ones."" RUNTIME: 115 minutesGRADE:"
Yes Man             ,sadagar,0,comedy,2008,7,"Being lucky, I already saw ""Yes Man"" and was pleasantly surprised. Jim Carrey is not really my all time favorite (despite his comic talent and acting skills), but in this movie he seems to have hit the spot.The story itself is really simple: Carl (Jim Carrey), a very negative man, goes to a meeting among the very positive Yes people, whose charismatic leader (Terence Stamp) preaches that one should say Yes to all questions and agree with all propositions. Carl is reluctantly convinced to try it out, and after meeting a girl on a scooter (the ever so lovely Zooey Deschanel) all sorts of things start happening around him. But being 100% positive might be tricky sometimes...It is all very silly, of course - but this feel-good comedy has a small undertone of seriousness as well. And it has a great cast, many delightful scenes, a reasonably relaxed Jim Carrey and a lighthearted style. Y/N? I say Y. 2"
Pathology             ,PoisonKeyblade,1,crime,2008,10,"Pathology, a slow-burning, atmospheric, slickly-filmed thriller, is the second most original movie of the year, second only to Cloverfield. However, Pathology is the better of the two films simply because of its terrifying subject matter and the very dark humor that is sometimes over-the-top. Milo Ventimiglia, Alyssa Milano, and Michael Weston are the front-runners in this horror/thriller, expertly directed by Marc Schoelermann and written by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the writing team behind the hugely underrated Crank.Harvard Medical School graduate Dr. Ted Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) arrives at one of the nations most prestigious Pathology programs and is quickly noticed by the program's privileged and elite band of pathology interns who invite him into their crowd. It is also here where he is introduced to Dr. Jake Gallo (Michael Weston), who brings him to a secluded wing, where he and four other indulge in there after-hours, extra-curricular activities...finding ways to commit the perfect murder. As Ted's life spirals out of control, he has to worry about the job as well as his engagement to Gwen (Alyssa Milano).The acting is top-notch and 100% believable, helped along nicely by the layered script with witty and realistic dialogue. On the surface, Pathology may appear to be a fun, quick, and forgettable popcorn flick, but it has a very subtle and deep message that is hard-hitting and relevant, especially in today's chaos-riddled times. My favorite performance of the cast was obviously Milo Ventimiglia, who completely stole the show every single time he was on screen. His boyishly good looks only serve to strengthen his charisma and delivery of each line. He makes Dr. Grey feel like a real person with such a realistic performance. And of course this is without mentioning the sensational sex scenes, riddled with numerous shots of Ventimiglia's gorgeous and tan behind thrusting in and out. It took courage to film such scenes, and I applaud him for such a spectacular performance. He carries the entire movie on his shoulders, and he has proved without a shadow of a doubt that he really has what it takes to be a great leading man. I hope he gets more roles that are as layered and difficult as this one. His last film, Dirty Deeds, was a fun guilty pleasure, but it was almost instantly forgettable and the writing was very faulty. He was hilarious and memorable as Bo, the gay jock, in Wes Craven's 2005 werewolf romp, Cursed. He has apparently stepped up his game since Heroes, and I can't wait to see what other films he has on his slate. Alyssa Milano, who is most widely known for her role in Charmed, does a great job here, although she gets a very minimal amount of screen time. Michael Weston, who I loved as the creepy car-jacker in Six Feet Under, was great in his role as Jake Gallo. Throughout the course of the movie, he basically goes completely psycho and Weston pulled it off beautifully. He hasn't been in many mainstream hits, and it's almost a shame that more people haven't seen this incredibly underrated actor.The directing was slick and intriguing, never getting repetitive, but always keeping it interesting. All of these actors give off some of their best performances, and it's strange because a lot of them are TV actors. This further strengthens the argument that the quality of TV shows has greatly increased since the 2000's, with people who can actually act taking the main roles.Pathology was one of the best thrillers I've ever seen and it's well worth your time if you're a lover of the horror genre or just plain interested in medical proceedings. There is a huge level of realism, and even the gore looked very real. This is a movie not to be missed. Seek it out in its limited theatrical release, or check it out when it hits DVD shelves! You won't be disappointed."
Righteous Kill             ,Deveousdevil,0,crime,2008,5,"***Minor Insignificant Spoilers*** What a disappointment. People have been waiting since ""Heat"" in '95 for another film where Pacino and De Niro co-star and this is what us loyal fans are given? Unacceptable, you have two of the greatest actors playing side by side and you give them this predictable and twisted script? WHHYYY!!?? If they were going to make another De Niro/Pacino flick they should've made it fantastic. This is mediocre. First off, why in name of all that is holy would they include 50 cent in a De Niro/Pacino movie. Who does that? It's as if they are purposefully lowering the value of this movie. Rule number 1 when making movies with classic actors - don't use ghetto gold tooth untalented rappers as filler actors, use good ones. Heat was full of good actors who played their parts well and spoke clearly, unlike the infamous ""fitty"".The story is very bad. It's too twisted and nonsensical. It's similar to Street Kings, which is a very bad thing. Pacino and De Niro act well, but not what you'd expect from these kind of actors. It's not entirely their fault, it's not easy making a rusty script shine even if you've been acting for 30 years.The music is pretty good. It sets the proper moods for most of the situations so it adds a little realism to the movie. The action is pretty weak. Heat was full of intense, unpredictable, and suspenseful action. This movie has predictable, poorly filmed action.Now, here comes the spoiler, to those who saw Heat. The ending is exactly the same as in Heat only the other actor gets killed this time. Honestly, could they get any more desperate that they have to copy the ending of a classic to make the ending of a bad movie slightly better. What's even sadder is that it didn't make anything better, especially if you're a Heat fan.Conclusion: If they wanted to make another De Niro/Pacino movie the writers and director should have tried much harder to make another classic as good if not better than Heat, or they should never have tried in the first place. It's insulting. You should watch it just to judge for yourself but don't get your hopes up"
Saw V             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,0,crime,2008,6,"The Saw series has always been a standard of sorts. After what I felt was an iconic debut, the series has always remained consistently interesting, with one of the most compelling and ever expanding plots in film history. People may complain that the series is in decline, but what people need to realize is that each part is astronomically better than the corresponding parts of other horror series (for example, Saw IV is better than Halloween IV, or the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street film). The same holds true for Saw V, though the film definitely shows that the series is in decline and needs to end soon before it descends into pure absurdity.A universal truth of the Saw series is that every entry, no matter who does it, will always be well written and contain a plot twist or two at the end. Again, Saw V continues the tradition of revealing the 'huge' (if you could call it that) twist whilst ""Hello Zepp"" by Charlie Clouser plays in the background. The film answers as many questions as it raises, and serves as more of an origin movie, like Saw IV did. Only this time, the origin doesn't focus on John Kramer/Jigsaw, and therein lies the problem.Why does Saw V fail to impress me? Simple. Not enough Jigsaw. Tobin Bell, who has managed to create an iconic villain over the last 5 years, delivers another sublime performance that is not to missed in the world of horror as perhaps the greatest villain of the decade. It really amazed me how Saw IV had the best acting of the series, but just one movie later, pretty much every performer falls flat on their face. This is especially sad considering most of the cast are returning characters, except your typical ""why is this happening to me! AHHH!"" type characters (which got unbearably annoying, considering they killed off the two least annoying ones first). Meagan Good and Costas Mandylor are acceptable in their roles, however.Back to the lack of Jigsaw. Tobin Bell really doesn't physically appear that much in the movie, and that is far and away its biggest flaw. The film is similar to Saw II more than the others. To get my drift a little better, imagine the second film, except reduce Jigsaw's screen time by about half. Yeah. This is the only weakness of the screenplay for me, which appears to have matured from the over the top torture porn in Saw III and the ridiculous attempt to run Saw IV concurrently with its predecessor. The film's biggest flaw is in the acting and lack of Jigsaw. Besides this, I really felt that it fit the mold as a worthy entry to the series.After watching this, however, I no longer feel that Saw is the standard of excellence in horror as it once was. That said, the film has the advantage of being short and never dragging. It's well paced and will more than deliver the thrills. Another thing I feel obligated to mention is that this is the least scariest film in the series, which is okay, because unlike every other cheap horror film, Saw V doesn't try to be scary. It's more of a thriller with some gruesome images (like the first film) than a full blown horror movie (like parts II & III).In the end, what it comes down to as far as your ability to enjoy the movie, you have to ask yourself this question: ""why do I watch the Saw series?"". If you watch it for the story and plot twists, you should be at least satisfied, if not entertained. If you watch the series for pure shock and awe and disgust, you'll be disappointed, because Saw V does not try to be a horror film outside of a few scenes. It's a decent entry to the series that is tolerable, despite a lack of the iconic Jigsaw, horrid acting, and a somewhat predictable plot twist (easily the most predictable of the series). "
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,djansen24,,animation,2010,NA,"This is a fun movie. Big Idea Productions improved their movie making skills from their last feature ""Jonah"". The movie is longer and yet feels shorter and more free flowing than Jonah. Yes, the Biblical message is quite buried, but definitely there. The animation has majorly improved (again, still not up to Pixar levels), the songs are still good (with the exception of ""Yo Ho Heroes""), and the pacing of the movie is very good. The side jokes are very funny and are thrown in all over the place without interrupting the story flow. This makes for a very streamlined production that keeps its focus and yet feels free flowing and not forced at all. And the scriptwriting for the the 3 main characters makes them feel like real pals who know each other well. This movie nowhere achieves the greatness of Pixar films, but taken on its own terms, it is very solid.And the best thing about the movie is that since it markets itself to kids, it is at its heart a children's movie. It keeps a sense of wonder and innocence about itself and doesn't try to win an adult audience deliberately. Recent animated features frequently market themselves to children, but then have such adult humor or violence in them that it makes the whole movie inappropriate for kids. ""Pirates"" is a bona-fide kids film that is fun, action packed, and entertaining. And it is refreshing in its kid-like nature that it will be a delight to parents t"
The Brothers Bloom             ,applescruff420-1,1,action,2009,10,"This may be my first review of a movie for IMDb. Can't remember if it is or it isn't but the point is I don't normally feel compelled to write about movies on this website. I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in advance at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles this February. I had not yet seen Rian Johnson's previous film Brick, so going in I had no biased opinion about the director or any expectations about what I was going to see. Basically what I saw was a movie that had a great story to tell. And it knew it, so it acted accordingly. I don't think going into detail about the events in the movie will do anyone any good, so I'll stick to a vague approach here. The movie has a similar vibe to Wes Anderson's work, but only in a purely superficial sense. The plot is of the ""caper"" mold and concerns two sibling con men and their virtually mute sidekick on a quest to trick rich people out of a lot of money. The actors are all first rate. Adrien Brody is essentially the lead, but Mark Ruffalo and Rinko Kikuchi round out the main group of characters. That is, until we meet the real star of this movie. Rachel Weisz has always been great in everything I've seen her in, but she commands the screen in this movie like I've never seen before. I'd put her on an early shortlist for Best Supporting Actress at next year's Oscars. Ultimately this movie made such a strong impression on me because of how well her character worked for me and the strong chemistry she had with Adrien Brody. I strongly recommend you avoid details about this movie in order to get swept up by this wonderful story, like I did. This is a must-see. "
La siciliana ribelle             ,m_pooley,1,crime,2010,NA,"Having lived in Sicily, this movie had extra relevance for me, especially as it deals with an aspect of the investigations into the Mafia, by magistrates Falcone and Borsellino, and the resulting maxi-trials in Palermo, with which I was not familiar, namely the part played by Rita Atria. I particularly liked the way the role of the mother typifies the see-nothing/say-nothing attitude of the people. This is emphasized in the scene where Rita's mafioso father is murdered by a rival. Windows and shutters are quietly closed and the piazza is deserted save for the corpse. The director also deserves credit for not making Rita a docile, frightened informer; instead she is feisty and she is not slow to tell the police what she thinks of them. It is a beautifully paced movie,with a well-told tale and is, like, ""Gomorra"" which concerned the Neapolitan Mafia, the Camorra, a movie that makes you angry. Angry at the utter scum who still permeate society in southern Italy and angry at the corruption of public officials who deal with such scum. At least something good has come out of those investigations and trials. There is a grassroots movement in Palermo called ""addiopizzo"". Young business people who were so shocked by the excesses of the mafia during the period of the investigations and the maxi-trials that they took to the streets, as can be seen in real-life footage at the end of this movie, and declared they were no longer willing to pay the ""pizzo"" (extortion) money demanded by the Mafia. A gripping and important movie."
W.             ,fanaticusanonymous,0,misc,2008,8,"Oliver Stone and Josh Brolin manage the impossible by giving a present reality a sort of farcical look. Frightening to see how easily the farce and the reality merge and marry in the most natural way. George W, eats his way into history. The most mediocre of men drowning in a pool of his own making and in a way, drowning all of us with him. But, somehow, neither Stone nor Brolin describe a monster. On the contrary, here the monstrosity is in our hands. The man was voted (sort of) twice. Richard Dreyfuss IS Dick Cheney. A terrifying truthful performance. Thandie Newton is the one really out there. She plays her ""yes woman"" like Talia Shire in the Godfather III. Very bizarre, but fun. So, the biggest surprise is that Stone didn't come with a hatchet but with a magnifying glass. Seeing what we already knew but a bit larger made for a riveting evening at the movies. "
Nights in Rodanthe             ,mathieu_mcdonald-1,1,drama,2008,1,"Let me get this straight:""Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside manner.""Wow. Move over ""The Notebook"", there's a new kid in town.Where to begin. Well, how about the depth of this ""relationship""? I think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps:1. Exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad. 2. Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Provide glib, unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives to each other via airmail.I noticed George C Wolfe has ""The Hairball"" and ""United Kanye West Project"" in his dossier. Would ""stick to your genre"" be too harsh? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, or laugh or even hope. But the reason they are able to do that is that, somewhere during the storyline, we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen. To make us care, there must be time spent developing these characters...their lives, their history, why we're watching them now. Wolfe didn't seem to want to ""waste our time"" with such trivialities, and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one-on-one interaction between two ACTORS we've all come to adore, but two CHARACTERS we could care less about.For one brief tender moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him for dinner, the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of ""what happens next"" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy that is courtship, we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know.Let's face it. We have all heard cheesy one liners in Romantic films. But the reason we cut some slack to Bogart in ""Casablanca"" or Nicholson in ""Something's Gotta Give"" is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters, and by the time they deliver the line, we're so deeply involved with their plight, we don't even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists, all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience.Wolfe takes the old Hollywood director's phrase ""cut to the chase"" much too literally here. As each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast, the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: ""c'mon. it's a Richard Gere romance. just buy in.""It is as a result of this stunning lack of character - or relationship - development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts. When Gere's character dies, I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didn't know passing away. Or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics. Just. Didn't. Care.Epic. Fail."
The Ruins             ,blackasp98,,adventure,2008,1,"I have to say that this movie was not what i expected. Even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with. With the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. This is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most, but not a crocodile. Either way this film was like that, it entices you to think about ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect. But plants?.... come on, is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd?. As for this movie it will hit the 'b' list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see, but it didn't make up for the rest of the film. And a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed. I am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects. I do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense. The thing had a better story line than this did. Even the ring had me jumping for more, but the ruins is just that..... ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers. The premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder."
Street Kings             ,Skriptman,,misc,2008,8,"Okay, let's face it. The credibility factor in almost ALL action flicks is questionable at best. If you really took the time to analyze the logic behind the story, you'd come up short. But, by definition, action pics are just that -- heavy on the action, and not so heavy on the logic that supports the story. With this in mind, Street Kings is a solid, well-executed action flick that has all the right ingredients: a non-conformist hero you WANT to root for; a never-let-up story that keeps you riveted to the end; and a stylish, fast-paced visual smörgåsbord that delivers from start to finish.Yes, the story falls short -- you'll find yourself asking questions like ""Why did the undercover cops that Tom Ludlow (Keanu) kill want to eliminate Detective Washington if they weren't part of Det. Wander's crew to begin with?"" Yeah, it does get a little dicey if you think it through -- but if you DON'T bother getting bogged down in the minutia, it works. Contrary to much of the published critique of the movie, I think Keanu brings exactly what is needed to the role -- he's vulnerable, jaded, broken... and invincible. What more could you want in a solid action pic?"
Surveillance             ,krigler,1,crime,2009,1,"Based on some early reviews I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I was ultimately very disappointed.Starting on a positive note, Surveillance is very expertly shot, and is beautiful to look at. However, on almost every other account it fails miserably. The first two acts are simply boring and annoying, mostly because of the quote-unquote ""weird"" characters. The people populating this story on paper might have looked interesting, seeing them acted out, however, just goes to show how incredibly difficult it is to create really interesting dramatic characters. These people act and behave like no human being would, just for the sake of being weird or unusual. The plot also progresses in a very leisurely manner. Then the third act comes, where events go from boring to completely nonsensical. The obligatory twist is just dumb beyond belief.Then the acting - geez, I don't think any of the actors should put this one in their resume. Bill Pulman, bringing his best ""constipated De Niro"" impersonation, is the worst offender. In the last act he overacts on a disastrous level, to a point where one wishes a meteor would fall from the sky and put him out of his misery. It has to be the most cringe-worthy, embarrassing episode of his career. But the rest of the cast also do their best to follow his lead. When will Hollywood learn that psychotic killers do not necessarily behave and talk like Jim Carrey on PCP? I've seen worse films in 2008 but given the talent involved I didn't think Surveillance would be such a painful experience to sit through. Avoid this stinker."
The Burning Plain             ,swAppp,1,misc,2009,NA,"""Burning Plain"" intrigued me from the opening scenes. In fact, I watched this film more or less hoping to see beautiful girls, rather than see a deep plot. It turned out that ""Burning Plain"" offered me both of these.If I start from the miss-shots in this movie, I have to say that there were some plot holes. There were unfinished developments of quite a few characters, but that is probably because you can't put everything in 100 minutes movie. Thurthermore, I actually enjoyed the twist of the plot, since I understood parts of it immediately, and others were unknown to the very end. I am glad that the plot is not lost during flashbacks and flash-forwards.Secondly, I enjoyed the problems which this film discussed, especially the problem of guilt. I caught myself even pondering, how should we face guilt? Should we run away, or should we welcome it open-handedly? Moreover, the girls were just I expected them to be. Young, beautiful and motivating. I would envy Guillermo Arriaga if I were in film business and I didn't get to work with such beauties.Lastly, the soundtrack. I didn't particularly notice it throughout the film, which is good, because it helped me focus on what is happening, but in the end, when the film had it's most emotional moments, the sound delivered. I understand Hanz Zimmer had something to do with it, and I congratulate him for such a nice participation Generally, films that offer nice girls do not offer awesome plot, but there are exceptions. As problematic as it is, ""The Burning Plain"" has its prettiness, which makes me rate the film 9/1"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,misc,2008,7,"Once again, another rating that baffles me here on IMDb, now granted, I haven't read the novels that The Sisterhood is based upon, but I really did enjoy the first movie, more than I thought I would. So I was looking forward to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, curious what the girls were up too in the story. The reason I like these movies so much is because they're very real; except for the traveling all around the world despite as if money was no issue, these being college girls mind you. But the story provides teenage girls who look like your average teenagers, their stories are very relatable if you are a girl, and we have comedy, romance, and drama, a typical chick flick, but thankfully these movies are enjoyable one's that don't push it. I felt like these girls are just so much fun and like I could know them in real life.Tibby has moved to New York, studying film and works at a movie store, but she has a bad pregnancy scare when her boyfriend's condom breaks. Thankfully it's a false alarm, but she is scared of her heart being broken once again. Lena goes to Greece for her Grandfather's funeral, she sees Kostos, but he is now married and is having a baby, so she takes an art class at home and starts dating the model that she is currently drawing. Carmen goes to Vermont to be in a drama club, expecting to work behind the scene, her leading man crush encourages her to audition and she gets a lead role causing some jealousy around the more experienced actors. Bridget goes to Turkey on an archaeological dig and finds out more about herself and goes home, but first she has to see the grandma who she thought didn't love her, it turns out she learns more about herself and her mother. But these girls have let their friendship go and must find a way to make the magic of the pants work once again.I would honestly recommend The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, I really did enjoy the story and acting, along with the characters. I think The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 is a notch below the first film, but it still works. There are minor flaws here and there, but it's very easy to get past, I don't understand the rating of 6.0 here on IMDb, this is an honest and genuine film that I think a lot of people could enjoy. I think my favorite story this time was with Carmen once again, she's the character I can relate to most and she's very much the under dog of the story. But all the girls are a pleasure to watch on screen, they make you laugh and just have a great time with their journeys. This is a wonderful movie and I can't wait to see it again.7/10"
The Reader             ,swillsqueal,1,drama,2009,8,"""Every single day -- 365 days a year -- an attack against children occurs that is 10 times greater than the death toll from the World Trade Center...We know how to prevent these deaths -- we have the biological knowledge and tools to stop this public health travesty, but we're not yet doing it."" Jean-Pierre Habicht, professor of epidemiology and nutritional sciences at Cornell.Eight million of the eleven million childhood deaths a year could easily be prevented. That's because almost 60 percent of deaths of children under 5 in the developing world are due to malnutrition and its interactive effects on preventable diseases. Is this not a holocaust? An old Soviet piece of gossip had it that Comrade Khruschev was interrupted during his famous 'secret' speech before the Communist Party elite when he denounced Stalin's crimes in 1956, three years after Stalin's death. A voice from the audience shouted, ""Why didn't you speak out against these crimes when Comrade Stalin was committing them?"" Khruschev looked up from his speech and asked loudly, ""Who said that?"" A long silence ensued after which Khruschev observed, ""That is why."" When you see ""The Reader"", ask yourself why you are doing nothing about the holocaust which is happening every year to the poorest children of the world. Is it because you are afraid to be seen as being 'silly' or too 'socialist' or 'soft hearted' or because the system demands that you pay attention to the important things of life like obeying your bosses and keeping order and besides, ""What can a lowly person like myself do about the situation"" and you're too busy speculating on what the real estate market will be doing in the coming months and finding a pair of jeans at Jeans West which will fit.....Michael meets Hanna when he is fifteen. Unbeknownst to Michael, he is coming down with scarlet fever. He is throwing up in an alley on a very rainy day when Hanna, the tram conductor, stops to offer him a warm place to rest until he feels better. Hanna also cleans up his vomit from the pavement. Hanna believes in orderliness and cleanliness. This penchant for order is apparent from the beginning of their relationship and these traits lead her to offer Michael baths and to bathe herself as well and as the movie progresses the motherly Hanna and her son-like friend begin to explore the attractions which flow from such erotic circumstances.Both Hanna and Michael are full of hidden passions. Michael could have been a Heydrich in Prague, had he been born 15 years earlier. He is clearly 'officer material'. Hanna, on the other hand, is a working class woman born 30 years earlier into a society which would tell women that their highest aspirations could be fulfilled by staying in the kitchen with the children when they weren't engaged in taking in a church service. with the family. Education was unnecessary. Both Hanna and Michael are intelligent and attractive. Both are turned on by the doors which are opened to them by great literature. Both are also social products of their own German culture, with its various and sundry facets of puritanical, psychological repression, including a kind of reserve which leads to the peculiarly German goodness of keeping one's mouth shut in public about things political, things which the authorities have well in hand. Hanna's fear of exposing her own illiteracy and Michael's fear of public condemnation as a young law student at speaking up for Hanna in a court of law are the stuff of tragedy. Sound familiar? Even after many steamy sexual encounters, Hanna is shocked by passages in D.H. Lawrence's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER, telling Michael that it is the equivalent of smut and that he should stop reading from it, almost as his mother would have. But clearly, Michael is not attracted to Hanna because she is a mother replica--Oedipus, no. One has only to compare and contrast Michael's screen mother with Kate Winslett's Hanna to know that.However, it is 'klip und klar' that Hanna loves Michael and he loves her but, unbeknownst to them both when they are together, their love runs very, very deeply. They might believe that they will get over their summertime romance as time goes by, but the reality is that such love does not die, no matter what happens: there are no conditions for it.There are elements of Fassbinder's ""Ali, Fear Eats the Heart"" and ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" in ""The Reader"". ""Sophie's Choice"" also comes to mind. See this movie and be prepared to cry for humanity because as Thoreau observed, """"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."" Methnks this is especially so in cultures as deeply built on the authoritarian personality character structure as the German one is."
The Women             ,vtiff,1,comedy,2008,4,"I've never seen the original movie others have commented on, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison.I found the message of the movie to be,: if you only worry about yourself, all will be right with the world, everything will fall into place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and like you more, your employers will want you more, pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more.I find this message to be reprehensible and totally false.Kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end; there isn't a mother out there who won't laugh during that scene.Overall a very disappointing movie plot. I didn't find myself rooting for anyone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that I just didn't care what happened to them and that's not a movie people want to see."
"Surfer, Dude             ",foolishsker-1,0,comedy,2009,10,"I mean what can I say, it's a flop, but so many good movies are flops. It has a bunch of B-rated actors, one A-list star, and Willie Nelson. Honestly I don't get why people don't like this movie...maybe because it lacks flash and boom boom pow. But for those of you on the fence about this film, just watch it, rent it, download it, whatever, at least decide on your own. True enough this is a stoner movie, because it's full of stoners, or even for those who are just wanting to watch something that won't make you feel bad about the white supremacy, or how corrupt the modern world is, or how we should go green, and it doesn't have major budget high flying, heart wrenching romance. and let's face it, that's what most movies are today.The movie runs a little under an hour and half and the storyline really doesn't go anywhere but you find yourself admiring the main character, Steve Addington, a slacker surfer bum who only wants to surf and chill with his buds and smoke bud. I mean that's all the movie is and that's all it needs to be. Granted the movie is funny, it has boobs, and it has a 'summer love' fling thing going on and it's just an all around calm, laid-back kind of feel to it.If you want flash, glam, big explosions, multi million dollar CGI effects...go somewhere else, go watch transformers 2 or GI Joe. If you want to just entertain yourself with a laid-back, calm and easy film, then by all means watch this film, I'll lend you my copy, cause you ain't gonna find it in wal-mart, believe I looked...What I am basically trying to say is this movie isn't going anywhere and it's not trying to, it's just there to be there and I think it's worth a watch, at least once. Me on the other hand I love this movie and I can't get enough of it. So go out and buy it, download it, rent it, steal it or whatever just watch it, then decid"
The Objective             ,Shattered_Wake,,horror,2008,7,"One of the directors of The Blair Witch Project teams up with the son of former United States Army General Wesley Clark to bring us this sci-fi war thriller about Special Ops soldiers in Afghanistan who come across a mysterious sect of Taliban members with a supernatural weapon of 'unimaginable powers.' The horror of war is something that the world faces constantly; but, ironically, there have not been many great horror films set in a war. This, while not technically a war film, has more than its fair share of guerrilla combat set in the desert of Afghanistan. The locations are fantastic and Morocco was a good replacement for what would obviously be a pretty difficult place to film a movie. So, the film automatically had the good looks going for it. Myrick did a good job of capturing the mountainous terrain and utilizing the various elements of the setting. The acting is pretty good and, more importantly, believable. That's saying more than a bit seeing as the script leaves a lot to be desired. I've known my fair share of military personnel over the years, and the soldiers did fit the roles well. Also, unlike many low-budget horror films with the military. . . they actually knew how to hold weapons and follow proper war protocol. It was refreshing to say the least. While on the characters, I will note one problem with them: There was almost no bond among the characters as a whole and very little development of the characters individually. As far as horror goes, there are some creepy scenes among the action of the battle sequences. One scene in particular involving some smokelike creatures seen through thermal scopes was fairly chilling. Unfortunately, as happens with many sci-fi films. . . the ending was pretty strange and confusing. It seemed thrown in so that they didn't have to give an explanation. I like open-ended conclusions often. . . but that doesn't mean they don't have to make sense. I enjoyed much of the rest of the film, however. Fans of Altered and similar sci-fi horrors should check this one out.Final verdict: 6.5/10."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,1,misc,2009,8,"I wish to clear up any mistake my summary for this might lead to: This is not poorly done. As for this being good or not, that is perhaps a little more subjective, as it may depend on your opinion of the RAF. This is another of the German films of recent years dealing with awful national situations of theirs, from a couple, to numerous, decades back. Whether it's therapeutic, apologetic, a third option or a mix of several that drives this trend, is up for debate. I find this and Der Untergang(or ""Downfall"") to be exceptionally well-done. As was also the case with that one, this requires you to pay close attention. The pace comes about as close to being outright overpowering - for two and a half hours straight, mind you - as it can, without crossing the line into it. This does also somewhat expect you to be familiar with the overall occurrences, otherwise, you may be confused and have trouble keeping track and following it. This is rather intense. It is a quite strong piece. Featured is an immense amount of violence, which is often graphic. The attitude towards nudity and sexuality is very relaxed. This is disturbing. It is by no means for the faint of heart, and mainstream audiences, if they give this a chance, should not expect it to be ""enjoyable"", in the traditional sense. It is not ""funny"". It is powerful. The cinematography and editing are excellent. The acting performances are beyond reproach. I don't know all the facts, but I understand that this isn't completely historically accurate, though it seems to come fairly close. The production values are incredible. I recommend this to anyone interested in an authentic drama based on the Rote Armee Fraktion. 8/"
What Happens in Vegas             ,Dragoneyed363,1,comedy,2008,7,"Alright, before you watch this movie, you know it is not going to be some deep, poetic Best Picture nominee. I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.The movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable Rom-Coms I have ever seen, but here again, it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be, and though I would say if you are looking for a Rom-Com for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see, if you have any interest in seeing this, I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for, it will be just what you needed. A refreshing little movie that deserves better reception."
The Lucky Ones             ,TheGOLDENWALRUS,,adventure,2009,7,"After being a huge fan of Neil Burger's first big movie, The Illusionist, I was very intrigued in seeing his next film. With an interesting cast of Michael Pena, Rachel McAdams, and Tim Robbins, I was very interest in seeing how the chemistry of these three would be together. They were very good.We have the older vet, Fred Cheaver (Tim Robbins), who just wants to go home and enjoy his remaining years with his wife and son. T.K. Pool (Michael Pena) got wounded in his private area and is afraid he can't 'get it up' with his girl where the relationship is apparently based on sex. And then we have Colee Dunn. She's the outgoing outsider with a broken family but means well with attempting to bring a guitar to a family she doesn't know where her friend and their son was killed in combat. She expects to live with them.The chemistry between the main leads are very good (especially Rachel McAdams). They don't have a ego problem as you might see in most post war movies (see Stop-Loss). I believe Burger's biggest point was to demonstrate the bond the the army has on each other and how they would go to big lengths to make sure one another is OK and safe while of course testing one another with impossible questions. T.K. didn't like Colee's deceased friend Randy even though he never knew him. Randy robbed a casino according to Colee and T.K. felt that's what the military doesn't want. Soldiers escaping their problems. Fred would always be there to babysit the two if any issues between the two would get out of hand but the truth is, the three of them loved each other.This film has no comparison to the very special ""The Illusionist"" but that is a very good thing. Variety seems to be an issue for a good portion of new coming directors in this new century. Neil Burger relied on a tight script and painted characters with ridiculous recurrences and run ins that made you one again understand why it was called 'The Lucky Ones.' My favorite was when Fred went to see his wife, she nonchalantly asked for a divorce. Moments later his son came home and said he needed tens of thousands of dollars to get into Stanford. After Fred went back out with his friends to relieve some tension, he ran into an old friend that he worked with who explained that the company that Fred and him worked for was out of business obviously meaning that Fred had no job and really no way of giving money to his son at the time.Solid film and lots of problems bit it saved by very good chemistry and performance"
"Surfer, Dude             ",gregormandella,0,comedy,2009,8,"This movie is about simplicity of life being threatened by too much greed. Our American life has decayed so far out of simplicity that there's now a whole generation that has no idea what a simple life is like. No wonder so many people don't get this movie! I surf and have for 20 years. I know a lot more surfers who are like these guys than aren't! All these guys whining about this not ""being real"" in regards to surfing need to lighten up a bit. Surfing used to be a lot of fun until it became mainstream and overcrowded. That's why I usually paddle over to the next peak to get away from the crowds even if it's not as good. This movie is more about a guy who loves his lifestyle and having it threatened by extinction than anything else. Take example from Tyler Durdin and ""just let go"". Let go of expectations and you might just find a gem right under your nose."
The Secret Life of Bees             ,DICK STEEL,1,drama,2008,10,"It's been two years since we last saw Dakota Fanning on the big screen here, in a film which was a adaptation of the literary classic Charlotte's Web. And what a career it had been for this child actress, now an adolescent, to have grown from scream queen (no thanks to her stint under Spielberg's War of the Worlds) to one controversial role in Hounddogs, which I doubt would make it to our shores here.Based on a novel by Sue Monk Kidd and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, The Secret Life of Bees is one powerful drama above love and the looking for love, as well as running along the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation. It's easy to dismiss this as a chick flick because of its predominantly female cast, but that would be a mistake to make in making it an excuse to miss this film altogether. For all its worth, it's chock full of extremely well delivered performances from veterans such as Fanning herself, together with Queen Latifah, Jennifer Hudson (proving that she's no flash in the pan), Sophie Okonedo, Paul Bettany and even Alicia Keys!Set in the time of Summer in 1964 Southern USA where the Civil Rights Act was just signed and in effect, the sentiments amongst the racist bigots still run high in a charged environment still hanging onto their old segregated ways. Fanning's Lily Owens carries the weight of her guilt buried deep in her subconscious from a tragic event that happened when she was four, and ten years later, after receiving the last straw of punishment from her abusive dad (Bettany), runs away with her caretaker Rosaleen (Hudson).As if led by an invisible hand, they soon find themselves under the extreme goodwill of the Boatwright sisters, who earn a living through the cultivation of bees for honey, and a series of incidents that bring about some tying of loose ends, and the discovery that these strangers do tie back to Lily's own quest to finding out the truth about her mom, to debunk the lies as told by her father. And of course this allows opportunity for some serious girl power bonding between the characters as they find that they have a lot more in common, as well as the sharing and spreading of love through their ranks.The trump card that this movie has, is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast. Fanning leads the pack and gives a wonderful moving performance as the gangling Lily, who thinks that she's quite a jinx with plenty of bad karma to go around, bringing about unfortunate happenings to her hosts which provide the dramatic twists and turns to what would otherwise be a flat movie. Jennifer Hudson had much to do in the first act, though her character got quite muted by the time the trio of the Boatwright sisters August (Latifah), June (Keys) and Okonedo (May) come along. Queen Latifah brings about some serious gravitas in her role as the eldest with the largest heart, and you cannot deny her chemistry with Fanning. Keys on the other hand plays the sister the exact opposite of August, being aloof and starting off with intense suspicion as to the intent of their guests. And Okonedo's role could probably be the most unorthodox of the lot, a fragile soul who has her own wailing wall to deal with the harsh realities of life.The Secret Life of Bees is well worth the admission ticket, and you'll be hard pressed not to be touched by the film, or moved by the themes it explores, especially when the third act comes by leading to quite a number of powerful revelations and a solid conclusion. Set against its intended backdrop, it's a reminder of tolerance, which the world lacks these days, and of course it's not always hammering in such heavy themes as it has its fair share of romance as well, and for what it's worth, Fanning has her first on-screen romance in this movie, and if I'm right, has her first on-screen kiss as well.You might be surprised when I say this, but this film has won me over enough for it to be considered as a contender when I shortlist my list of ten top films of the year. Definitely recommended!"
College Road Trip             ,pekroeger,1,adventure,2008,9,"OK, this isn't the movie I would select if just my husband and I were going out for the evening. But WE aren't the audience for this- Disney made this for kids and tweens and YES even teens. I have 3 daughters 13, 11, 7, and this movie hit the notes right for THEM. The interplay between Raven's character Melanie and her friends was right on. There is a scene where Melanie's Dad (Lawrence) and she are in the car, and she is on her cell phone forever with their friends- it is so true to life and you would only know that if you've experienced this.In terms of appropriateness for kids, I can't think of anything in this movie that would offend. There is silly slapstick comedy that had adults and kids alike laughing. Kids who watched Raven on her Disney channel show loved watching her act in this movie. The Donny Osmond character was over the top and, according to my 7 year old, totally hilarious.Would I select this movie just for me? NO. But folks, if you are looking for a movie for the family to see, or something I could show a mixed age group, this is great. I could pick apart little things about the movie, but those parts of the movie I found to be silly or ridiculous were irrelevant to the kids. This movie both has a heart and is sweet in spirit. I wish more people would CONSIDER the AUDIENCE for whom the movie is intended when writing a review. "
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,cassielarke,0,adventure,2010,8,"If you are planning on seeing this, DO! It is a bit slow but you will come to love the characters and their flaws. It is not average road-trip to self discovery it is more. The lead characters have a tense and fearful journey ahead. As they open themselves up to each other we see the story take a journey that reminds me of To Kill A Mockingbird as we see the film from two innocent teenagers points of view. The writing is sarcastic and not at all Hollywood flashy it is down to earth and heart warming. A truly uplifting story to all who to let your teenager nature over-run them for 2 hours. You just might believe there is a happy ending in life for everyone. You should watch this movie, it is not one to miss!!"
Ghost Town             ,shelshula,0,misc,2008,10,"This is such a lovely film. It manages to be sweet and touching without the maudlin saccharine problems of similar movies.It has a very talented cast. Tea Leone and Greg Kinnear are excellent as always, but Ricky Gervais is a delight. Having never seen him in anything else, I didn't know what to expect, but he carried the movie beautifully. He really made the character believable and not just a caricature or a one trick pony played for laughs. You could really see the sadness and the pain of the character. It was so wonderful to watch the character develop over the course of the film.Also, it is one of those films which have become so rare these days. It is an intelligent film written for an adult audience which is still appropriate for a broad range of audience. In other words, I can take my mom to see it without being embarrassed.I'm so happy I saw it, and I hope Ricky Gervais is in any more films to come"
The Duchess             ,blackburnj-1,1,misc,2008,8,"The career of Keira Knightley has been somewhat of a mixed bag. She has had strong moments, invariably under the direction of Joe Wright, and she has had her less brilliant moments, mainly in the later ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. But, in ""The Duchess"", an entertaining and moving portrait of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, she truly shows signs that she is coming of age with a performance of subtlety and nuance.The film has been marketed with not so subtle emphases on Georgiana's relative, Diana, Princess of Wales. The tagline for the film, ""There were three people in her marriage"", is not only, by my count, a miscalculation (a serious miscalculation if you count the dogs) but also guilty of creating a subtext which simply isn't in the film. Anybody looking for a film about Diana will be disappointed. Anyone looking for an entertaining film won't be.The film is a moving portrait of a very tragic figure, brought to life by a career best performance from Keira Knightely. Her abilities have grown over recent years, with ""Atonement"" being her previous best, but here she shows great potential. She is ably supported by Ralph Fiennes, who is on fine form. His performance never descends into caricature or cartoonish villainy, but maintains a sense of humanity, no matter how selfish it is, underneath his characters various inexcusable actions. There is also a fine performance from Charlotte Rampling, though there is a weak link in the person of Dominic Cooper, who is too young for his part and struggles with it.The witty and emotive script has a lot to recommend it and its characters are put into an engrossing and lavish world, successfully created by the director Saul Dibb. Extraordinary costumes fill the extraordinary locations, and there is a beautiful score by Rachael Portman to accompany it. The result is a fairly stylish affair.The film's exploration of unfortunate innocence and the loss of freedom is at times poignant and adds to what is an extremely satisfying experience at the cinema and provides a great deal of promise for the future from its director and its star. 1"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,AndrePhilidor,1,adventure,2008,8,"My wife is a dog-lover (I am not). We raised pugs for many years and they are all gone to doggy heaven now. When I saw a film preview that included a pug, I just had to get my wife to this movie. (She will rarely go to a movie - many are just plain bad). We had a GREAT time. It is a comedy, so let's not worry about the misplaced geography which I did not notice until reading some of the negative views here. I am a great admirer of the film-making art. The freight train episode is an amazing piece of film work. The attack of the mountain lions is quite convincing. Both of the latter we found quite convincing. Every pooch in this film deserves an Oscar as do the humans and the writers. This is a fine family movie, for both children and adults. Don't take it seriously. It is a comedy. It is an entertainment, and we just felt we needed something like this to get away from the depressing news - economic disaster in America, fires in California to the North and South of us. This film is just what the doctor ordered for an evening."
Wanted             ,moreplease,1,action,2008,5,"Like so many modern Hollywood moves ""wanted"" looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie. It's another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfilling.What killed the film for me was that it was utterly ridiculous from top to bottom. From the opening scene you think you are watching something like the ""Matrix"" but the movie never gets around to explaining how these assassins attain superpowers. If I could train hard for a few months getting the sh*t beat out of me and bathing in krispy kreme sugar and somehow develop superpowers to defy all know laws of physics, I would get started right away. It wants to look and feel like reality, but unlike comic book movies like ""Ironman"", it asks you to swallow way more implausible nonsense than you may be able to stomach. In fact, ""Ironman"" looks like a documentary compared to this noisy, overdone ""rollercoaster"". I did not know going in that the movie was based on a comic about superheroes and supervillians. They should have committed more to that...there effort to make the movie ""real"" just made it a sloppy mess.So it's a fantasy film that I found difficult to get into. The action is well done, the effects look great, but its another case where you are lucky not to have an epileptic fit by the first hour from all the flash cutting and gimmicks. Half the movie is in bullet time.And then of course there is the loom, which is just a retarded concept and in the face of everything else, I found myself rolling my eyes. If they had spent half the time they spent on effects working on the story, we would all have been better off. James McAvoy does his best with what he's given and its his performance that keeps the movie from slipping even further into the abyss. Jolie is always great but not given much to do here but look sexy... 2"
Mamma Mia!             ,arichmondfwc,1,comedy,2008,4,"Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me. 1"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,compel_bast,0,animation,2008,2,"I tried to open minded about this film when I first went to the cinema, determining that ""I'm a star wars fan, and no matter how bad it is, it's still Star Wars.""That feeling lasted about um... a second and a half from the start of the film. It started off fine with the, ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away."" I smiled, prepared myself for the classic theme and it... never came. I had been told it was 'remixed' beforehand, but I was expecting something not too different, the new composer didn't even keep the first 4 notes.Then we move onto the 'Opening Crawl' - which didn't exist. Another staple of Star Wars, even found in the games, gone, poofed completely. It was replaced with a narrator speaking over a kind of WW2 'news reel'. A few minutes into it and already the film has lost all its feel of being Star Wars, by no doubt intentional design decisions. In my book, if the writers/directors/producers etcetera intentionally changed something, and it turned out badly, it's still bad.It got worse, the opening battle could have potentially been something good and enjoyable to watch, instead it was as if it had been played in fast forward, I could almost imagine the 'Benny Hill' theme being played in the background.Admittedly, I was a bit biased towards the 'art style' before hand so I thought, if I'm going to write a review on it, I'll avoid mentioning it as it would be rather unfair and not truly neutral. So I will avoid commenting on it except to say, that it gets worse. When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine walked into a scene, his style was seemed to be entirely based on a... bobble-head toy. There is 'stylised' drawing (which I would define by the early 1990's Batman cartoons) and then there's 'caricature' - Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I felt was the latter. Additionally, the animation was jerky, possibly as a reference to the 'Thunderbirds' puppets. In my opinion, it didn't work, it just made it look even worse.The film is a children's oriented film, and I'm perfectly happy to accept that. In honesty, this was the strongest part of the film. The new Padawan was someone that children could enjoy watching and identify with. There was even some humour involving her and ""Stinky the Hutt"" that could be enjoyed by the little 'uns. However, I think in trying to appeal to children, they actually managed to make the dialogue even worse than Attack of The Clones and going on to insult the intelligence of the kids in the audience to boot. A typical conversation, which was repeated several times in the films follows.Character A: ""Jabba the Hutts son has been kidnapped."" Character B: ""The Jedi Order must go and rescue Jabba the Hutts son."" Character A: ""If the Seperatists rescue Jabba the Hutts son first we'll lose the war."" Character A: ""Then it's agreed, we must rescue Jabba the Hutts son from being kidnapped.""While this conversation was on-going (and going, and going), the characters tones would randomly change from low to high to low again. I believe, when Obi-wan was speaking, this was an attempt to copy his voice from episode III, it didn't work. The only character that avoided this was the Padawan, Ashkoja, which, truth be told, made her scenes are more watchable than any others.Finally, a good word about it, scenes that didn't have any characters in them, for example space and 'landscape' scenes did look particularly good and demonstrate the potential for how enjoyable the film COULD have been. However, due to several strange, strange design decisions that seemed only to have been changed for the sake of being changed, I would recommend against even renting this film. If you must see it, wait for it to come on television. 1"
One Missed Call             ,DICK STEEL,0,horror,2008,1,"One Missed Call gets filed amongst Hollywood Remakes of Japanese Horror that shouldn't have been green lighted in the first place. I suppose with the likes of so many of such remakes, the supposed winning formula would be to adopt the story, slap some relatively known actors in it, and employ every trick in the Hollywood horror book, and expect the box offices to go ka-ching! Wrong! One Missed Call happens to be One Big Bore!I am beginning to affirm that horror remakes by Hollywood are a waste of time. What made the Asian ones work, is because of a certain X-factor appeal in them, pertaining to the building of atmospheric mood, which plays a key role in maintaining tension, and some really ingenious and innovative ways of exposing the ghoul for a good scare. Hollywood instead dives straight into such scenes with so much noise, even the ghoul would have run away. It doesn't mean that with a bigger budget and better special effects, it's an automatic triumphing over the relatively lower key originals. They work for a reason, and more money being thrown at it, is just not the answer.I am curious to know how Edward Burns would have truly thought about his role here, as well as the storyline. A filmmaker himself, I guess he needed to pay the bills and perhaps fund his own projects too. I had enjoyed his performance in 15 Minutes and Confidence, not masterpieces but at least a tad enjoyable, and while he has the occasional dud like A Sound of Thunder, I thought his role here as a generic cop, really took the cake. It's just so lazy a character, he got slapped into the thick of things in pure coincidental fashion, and not to mention just going through the motions of it all, looking concerned most of the time, and being cut out of the action for the most parts too conveniently.Shannyn Sossamon probably had everyone take notice with her lead female role in A Knight's Tale, alongside Heath Ledger and Paul Bettany. While her male co-stars went on to bigger and better roles, she got perpetually stuck with unremarkable ones, and with turkeys such as this. In true Final Destination style, her friends around her start dying after she hears their missed call/voice messages, which contains their last utterances on Earth, before their untimely demise, the exact moment all coldly printed on the LCD screen of their mobile phone. Even the deaths too seem uninventive, and so bad I would've settled for a simple knife stabbing just to get over it.And the supporting characters? Don't bother. Too many one dimensional roles here which calls for half exposed cleavage to spice things up a little and hold the attention of pimply boys it hopes to target in the audience. I tell you, one more of this demonic kid nonsense, and that's it, it get a stamp of rejection. What's with demonic kids? Can we get over this group already? Can we move on from crazed children who probably needed a good spanking to slap the devil out of them? And move on too from the creaking doors, insipid light and shadow play, sudden crescendos in the soundtrack, and cheap shots passing off as ""ingenious"" ways to scare the audience. It's boring when it doesn't get done right, and comes off as lackadaisical.But what's truly scary, would be you downloading from somewhere, the ring tone that is featured in the movie, and into your friends mobile phone. It's now synonymous with impeding doom and death, so if you want to wish someone ill-will, then this is your ringtone of choice. If I can create a ringtone and make money out of it, then this is the one to create, right now before the fad dies off.One missed call? Don't return the call please, and delete it from your phone records. For good. Skip it and don't bother with the rental"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,Robert_duder,0,drama,2012,8,"Fireflies in The Garden was panned by basically everyone. The dysfunctional family story took three years to be released on DVD which is astounding considering the enormous strength of this cast. Many reviewers all say the same thing that movies like this are a dime a dozen and that might be true. That doesn't this cast and this film any less captivating. Perhaps part of the issue that many see in this movie is that it is in no way packaged in a neat little box with sunshine and rainbows. This is a very dark drama about a very messed up family and there isn't a happily ever after for them. If you can handle a dark drama then you will be rewarded with some terrific performances. Ryan Reynolds shines in his role as the grown up son who has many emotional problems because of a verbally abusive father. That father is played with excellent force by Willem Dafoe. Obviously playing a villain type character is not new for Dafoe but his character is so pathetic, with so much depth, you will just despise him and beg for his redemption much like his family does. Emily Watson is sort of ho-hum compared to the rest of the cast. Once you've accepted that Hayden Panettiere somehow grew up to look like Emily Watson...she also loses all her passion for the role. Panettiere is much better as the younger Jane in the movie. Julia Roberts is good in her role though she isn't used all that much and sort of takes a more ceremonious role in the movie. People are always clamouring for Hollywood to do something unique and I give a lot of credit to first time writer and director Dennis Lee for not making everything neat and tidy. Sometimes you can be in the mood for a dark drama and some solid performances makes this one captivating. Ignore the harsh reviews and give it a chance! 8/"
The Objective             ,Jobbe9,,horror,2011,NA,"Should we follow these brave men on their objective, or should we go on the subjective and fail their mission?The film is set in Afghanistan (don't know where it's actually filmed, though) and thus creates a believable atmosphere and setting. The story does not deviate from what we have come to expect in Military-Sci/Fi-things as of late, but still manages to set itself apart from the paranoia and suspicion evolving the CIA. The story is told through the main-character, on his journey to uncover the truth about some abnormal readings in a remote area of Afghanistan.The main-character is, however, also my main problem. He is dry, he is extremely dry. Not showing emotions or even just humane reactions, he becomes a shadowy figure and, sadly, falls into the stereotypical role of an agent on a secret mission. His voice is monotonous and overall he lacks charisma. The other characters are as believable as they come. They actually seem like real people you would meet on the streets. Just that these guys are soldiers and not regular people.The story is slow to evolve but as their sightings grow in both number and essence you'll find yourself wanting to know more. Only a few times does the film seem boring but as a whole, it's worth the wait to let it unfold. The story is not original, mind you, but what is these days?Technically the film is sound. Nothing particular about it, really. It's mediocre and it's seems happy to be just that.Anywho, give it a go if you want to kill off an hour and a half and not making it feel like a complete waste of time, but don't expect a film that'll save your day"
Goodbye Solo             ,m-p-gordon,0,drama,2009,10,"I just got back from watching Goodbye Solo at the Harvard Film Archive and absolutely loved it. I so appreciated how Ramin Bahrani had the courage to let the story unfold organically at its own pace. Sometimes films have what I call (for lack of a better term) ""perfect moments."" It can be a scene, a shot, a line of dialogue or just a look from an actor, but it's a moment where suddenly I am completely and fully aware. Aware of the story unfolding before me, aware of myself watching the story, and simultaneously aware of the fullness and richness of life itself -- joy, pain, love, sadness -- aware that life is big enough to encompass all of this at once. I feel lucky if a film has even one or two such moments. Many films have none. In Goodbye Solo, the perfect moments washed over me one after another until I lost track. How wonderful and rare. Thank you to all who had a hand in making such a touching and beautiful fil"
The Reader             ,bgillespie24,1,drama,2009,3,"In watching movies I have a couple of basic rules. The one rule in that list that pertains to this movie is: ""The actions and decisions of sane or flawed characters in a movie must make some sense in a real way"". In this movie they do not.Here are two questions that I'll ask and you tell me the honest answer. Question 1: Would you keep a secret hidden that although embarrassing would make the difference between a 4 year prison term and possible life in prison? Question 2: If you were studying law and had information that could radically change the outcome of a trial would you withhold it?My guess is that 99.9% of people would say no to both questions. In this movie, the other choice was made for both.This alone destroys the credibility of the film's premise, but there is much more. Here's another question: If you had a love affair with a much older women while you were 16, would you eventually take your daughter to her grave site and recite every gory detail, promising her a ""big surprise"" before doing so?I could go on but you get the point. The basic premise of the movie IMHO is brilliant, that is, ""how could so many people do such inhumane things to other human beings while thousands of others knew but did nothing"". The gigantic problem with the movie is the question was pondered while multiple characters in the movie did implausible things.This movie could have been brilliant; sadly it is anything but. "
Nim's Island             ,Grissom66,1,adventure,2008,8,"Anything can happen on Nim's Island, a magical place ruled by a young girl's imagination. It is an existence that mirrors that of her favorite literary character, Alex Rover -- the world's greatest adventurer. But Alexandra, the author of the Rover books, leads a reclusive life in the big city. When Nim's father goes missing from their island, a twist of fate brings her together with Alexandra. Now they must draw courage from their fictional hero, Alex Rover, and find strength in one another to conquer Nim's Island. This movie shows that not only family movies are for kids but for adults as well. A very good film!. Nim's Island 8/10"
Deception             ,Siamois,0,crime,2008,4,"The thriller genre has been well explored and perfected over decades of cinema. While some familiar elements and conventions are to be expected in a new release, you would expect, at the very least, that a new entry tops the previous ones.And sadly, Deception does not. The movie almost feels like a remake of Curtis Hanson's Bad Influence. A movie that was made almost twenty years ago and features two main characters that are carbon copies of those of McGregor and Jackman, only they were played respectively by James Spader and Rob Lowe.Whatever ""twists"" are found in Deception, you see them coming from a mile and they fall flat. The acting? Everybody seems to be cashing his check. One-dimensional characters and an aimless plot make for a boring two hours. Even the ""list"" subplot feels tacked on and doesn't even provide any enjoyment, nor does it add anything to the film.The photography is amazing but this is truly a poor Hollywood movie and one that you will be better off passing on, unless you are a die-hard fan of the genre or one of the main actors featured. All in all, a tremendous waste of talent and resources due to a crappy script."
Shutter             ,wolf_stoned,0,horror,2008,6,"The trailers for this movie made it look pretty good, but it turned out to be not the best movie. It delivers the scares, but there are too many 'false alarms'. A lot of the love stuff in the beginning could've been left out. The real horror starts a little too late, and basically is pretty corny. Most of the acting is pretty bad, and some of the dialogue seems to be totally improvised. This is one Japanese horror remake that shouldn't have been made at all in my opinion. It has a pretty bad plot that takes a long time to unfold and, at times, is rather boring. Warning - do not be fooled, for this is one movie that blows! If you want to see a movie, just avoid this, and see something else instead. Trust me."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,zekisadic,0,action,2008,5,"I find it very amusing to read all the reviews here. I mostly agree with all the ones who found it disappointing, I can see why the Michael Bay-loving GTA-generation could give this a '10', however: Lots of CGI, fake green-screen action and style over substance.For me - a die hard Indiana Jones fan, who grown up attending premieres for the first three - this was a big letdown, primarily because of the script, which could have been written by a 11 year-old. A lot of Indiana Jones fans all over the world are probably scratching their heads these days, wondering why a script (Darabonts) which Spielberg called ""the best he has read since Raiders"", was scrapped by Lucas. So he could give us this? Tarzan meets X-files?It just didn't rock my boat, like the first three. I even found 'National Treasure II' more entertaining, than this mess. 1,160"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,saadgkhan,0,adventure,2010,6,"THE YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF  CATCH IT ( B ) The best thing I loved about this movie was the Odd Characterization; William Hurt as Ex-Convict, Kristen Stewart as 15yrs old Confused Teen, Eddie Redmayne as the weird psycho nerdy dirty teen and Maria Bello as any other woman who gets tired of her life. A good attempt by the director and he made most out of the script. It keeps you intriguing and wondering what happened between Maria and William plus a weird relationship between Kristen and Eddie keeps you stuck with the story. Though I have felt at times it gets little slow but then again it paces up. Kristen Stewart looks damn gorgeous and acted well. Eddie Redmayne as a psychotic weird teen did a good job, another Britain import to look out for. William Hurt and Maria Bello are seasoned actors so obviously they were great. Overall a good movie about redemption & love."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,lukasjoley,0,animation,2008,1,"Star Wars: the Clone Wars is, in every single way, a failure. The characters are shallow, Anakin showing none of his darker side even through the movie takes place between Edisode II and III, and the others being either overly colorful and annoying or really dull. I do realize the movie is meant for kids, but even Ratatouille has more character depth than this. The story and dialogue lacks any kind of quality; the core of the story is about Jabba the Huts child who has been kidnapped by the Separators (who later becomes the Imperials), who are trying to frame the Jedi Council for it, while Obi-Wan, Anakin and Ashoka (Anakins padawan) are sent out to save the Hut child. In their path stands a Sith Lord who, for some reason which we do not know, wants revenge on Anakin. The dialog lacks any substance at all, and the catch lines (and there are painfully plenty of those) are stupid and lame. As for the animation, it is far behind other studios such as DreamWorks or Pixar, with blocky character models, poorly animated action sequences and overall outdated graphical quality and texturing. Also, the movie lacks too much of what makes Star Wars ""Star Wars"". Hardly of the original actors have lent their voices to the movie, and you can really feel the difference. The score has not been written by John Williams, and that is something you will surely notice, as Kinders score isn't even remotely close to his work, and doesn't have the Star Wars feel at all. The only original Star Wars songs used are the main theme and ending theme, and one other song. Also, there is no plot summary at the beginning of the movie. No, there is no plot summary. I must ask, have George Lucas had anything to do with this at all? The whole movie is a complete failure. From the very first second, to the last of the credits. A complete failure. "
The Reader             ,Michael Fargo,1,drama,2009,10,"The film is a series of profound moral dilemmas<U+0097>while contrived by the author, they are fair questions<U+0097>that resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.All this is a pretty heady mix for a film, but Stephen Daldry (as with ""The Hours"" ) makes literary conceit play very naturally here. David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the always remarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making. But the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginal innocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, and we're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the ever confounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this young actress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of the best performances of the last decade: ""Holy Smoke,"" ""Eternal Sunshine<U+0085>,"" ""Iris,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" ""Little Children."" But here she does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster, we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring this off, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date. Ralph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, and there's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity the role deserves. I'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missed seeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the most heart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud. 3"
Milk             ,cwood0609,0,misc,2008,10,"Born and raised in a southern, catholic community, I saw that homosexuals were always grouped with prostitutes and rapists in our religion books. Something didn't quite sit right with me when I saw this ever since I was very young. The anti gay feelings abound in a small southern city, and, although I myself am straight, I was always in the minority of gay right supporters.Van Sant's Milk could not have come at a better time in my life. This movie is a transcendent bio pic, and an inspiration to me now and forever. In my theater, a packed crowd with an average age of about 60 gathered. (I found this interesting, why so many seniors? Was it guilt?) The film exceeds both as a touching biography and a bold social statement. Van Sant really does what Alfred Hitchcock so famously did, and ""played the audience like a piano"". We laughed, we thought, and came out of the theater a little bit more in tune with reality. I was the youngest in the theater by about 40 years, so I saw from an outside looking in at what this film really did.So much has been said about how well made the film is that anything else would be redundant, but the praise is well deserved. Penn should be a top runner for Best Actor, as he completely disappears into his character. Another actor that was an absolute thrill to watch in this movie was Emile Hirsch, who was fantastic.So emotionally wrenching, it will stand the test of time. It is so powerful because everyone knows someone that's gay and someone that's a bigot. The best movie of the year I've seen."
Surveillance             ,Samiam3,1,crime,2010,6,"Jennifer Chambers Lynch, one would assume had been nursing her pride from the dreadful reception of her debut, Boxing Helena. Fifteen years later she releases Surveillance. This one, a murder mystery, is a major improvement but it still has problems. It is a well-crafted seventy minute movie with a remaining twenty minutes of clumsiness, bad writing and a twist which unfortunately is predictable. The movie comes apart when it needs to come together, and the result is medium good, when it could have been very good.FBI agents Anderson and Halloway for months have been investigating a series of interstate serial killings. The latest chapter in their investigation brings the stories of two odd-ball cops, a dis-communal family on a road trip, and a couple of coke-snorting kids, together in Rashomon fashion. I like the way Surveillance plays out. Lynch keeps everything slow and mannered, unlike Boxing Helena which is over-blown from the beginning. Lynch is able to keep the film under control, but unfortunately is unable to pull the wool over the viewer's eyes. The answers we are looking for become obvious too quickly, making one question whether her intention was to have the viewer fooled or not. Survaillance is not designed to be conventional thriller. It is too deep and psychological for that, but it sort of ends like one.If I was gonna label Surveillance in a word, it would be 'bitter'. When it's over, you come to realize that none of the characters (save one or two small roles) are all that respectable. Lynch's screenplay breaks them down into those who mistreat and those who get mistreated, sometimes both. On a positive note it contributes significantly to the drama or tension of the picture. There is a major lack of heart to the film, although at the same time, there is a certain lack of credibility as a side effect. Any attempt to explain may be a spoiler so I wont go that far, but that raises another question...If I don't intend to spoil it, does that mean I am recommending it? Well, truth be told, I didn't dislike Surveillance. It is eerie and grim, which is certain a plus for a thriller, but the outcome is kind of disappointing. My advice: watch it only if you are curious, but it is not a movie that needs to be seen."
Wendy and Lucy             ,yxo-1,1,drama,2009,10,"I haven't read all the comments, but all that I have - missed the main point. Attachment and compassion are the most prominent features of this film. Innocence and dignity are the 'supporting' ones. Her integrity and almost childish self-respect/pride saved Wendy in the situations where we were so worried for her. It is not how many dollars Wendy had left, or why she is in this position. It is her enduring, loyal, determined and dignified character that matters. She is the 'salt of the earth', the true representation of the essential 'American'. Those who get up every morning and go to their daily journey and do what is necessary to survive and move on. The others (regardless of their socio-economic situation) gorge themselves on hamburgers or caviar, or other gluttony supplies. She - wouldn't. Give her a million dollars - she'd open a dog sanctuary or an orphanage. She would. Not that it is in her future. A real 'gem in the rough'. Go see it and don't expect any fancy techniques or dramatic ending. Life as it is. Just spirit and humanness. This film will linger inside of you longer than most. Don't react right away. Hold it in your chest and it will propagate. As I - you may cry hours later. And no <U+0096> it is not depressing. It is a hymn to all those character features I listed above. And more."
Pathology             ,Joeydog,1,crime,2008,10,"I was very intrigued to see this film. I was impressed by how real it was on many levels. It started me thinking about human nature, ethical limits, and our ability to influence those around us. I disagree with those who say it was gross for effect as working in the medical field, one knows that this is a part of life that people would rather not be aware exists. I see it all the time, It is reality --just not in such a condensed form. There was an intelligence about the film that ALMOST blossomed. But I soon became frustrated when it couldn't decide if it was a love story or a psychological thriller. The actors they chose were very believable character actors, no CW actors here. I've been following most of their careers. Props to casting. There seemed to be a lot of research to make this film realistic as usually when I see a medical type show, I can tell when the actors are just swinging around tools and don't know the last thing about them. Not the case here. That being said, I don't understand why one would go through the trouble of casting a great group of actors and talk about ""The Game"" they are playing and then show ""the game"" in a goofy quick shot type form? I was up for the ride. The part with the Pimp and Michael Weston, reeled me in and I thought that the plot would continue with this type of precision with the other characters. But instead I was left guessing what was the glue that brought this group together? Alyssa Milano is beautiful and I think she was right for this part but there was this dreary tone to her scenes that should of been the bright spot of the film. I wanted her to light up Ted Grey's life! Wrong choice for the film makers in my opinion to not showcase her with a more positive slant. But some amazing scenes, amazing speeches by most of the actors especially Michael Weston who just jumped to my top male actor list to watch, just confusing. Yes, I'm confused."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,don-agustine,0,misc,2009,8,"A stunning Italian film. And when was the last time I was able to say that? A masterful achievement without concessions to the larger public who doesn't know or care about Italian politics. The film has a life of its own. It's like a Shakespearean adaptation of a modern Mephistopheles. If you don't know who Giulio Andreotti is you will want to know because it feels and looks like a fictional character. How is it possible that someone so obviously guilty of undiluted evil could sit, still, in the senate and being treated like a celebrity worthy of absolute respect. Someone said, only in Italy, but I think that's far too simple. True, Italy seems to award some kind of venerable status to some big criminals that got away with it, one way or another. All of it is here, in ""Il Divo"" a riveting study, a wildly entertaining X ray of one of the most puzzling figures in modern political history."
Igor             ,jsmith-348,0,animation,2008,6,"Give us a break, will ya? No one expects a movie like this to equal ""WALL-E"" or ""The Iron Giant""! Granted, it rips off ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" unabashedly (was anyone else as bugged as I by the shameless similarity between Malaria's King Malbert and ""Nightmare's"" Mayor?); and it has some pretty flat writing in spots. But there are good jokes (""Jaclyn/Heidi""; a ""Yes Master's Degree"") -- and you gotta love Eva, with the way she riffs on the Frankenstein tradition. Instead of misfit who can't figure out how to act right in a normal world, she's a maladjusted do-gooder in a kingdom of darkness. And that Louis Prima soundtrack -- some songs sounding like they were written just for this movie! I sat through it with a handful of families, and the kids sure liked it a lot. My guess is, it'll become one of those mid-level films like ""PageMaster"" or ""Surf's Up"" that some kids watch again and again.Not great; but by no means the disaster it's made out to be in other reviews here. . .

The Brothers Bloom             ,ddeepinder-ssingh,1,action,2009,9,"I have to say , this movie was certainly a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of the crap that has been coming out of the big production houses.If your looking for a different movie all together , with a good story line , great acting and lovely music score ( composed by Nathan Johnson , its perfectly matches the essence being portrayed in the movie) , this is it.Adrien Brody , Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weiz are just amazing through out the movie . The chemistry between Brody and Ruffalo is certainly a high light of the movie , they don't look like brothers but throughout the movie you hardly notice. Rachel Weiz is as always amazing. Love her character.Of course i cannot go away without mentioning Rinko Kikuchi as Bang Bang ,hardly any dialogues in the movie apart from a few one liners ,including ""FUCK ME "" ( you cannot miss it :P ) she definitely steals the show as the quirky mysterious sidekick .I am writing this right after watching the movie so my rating as of now is definitely 9, a must watch if your tired of the usual movies hitting the screens.Recommended."
Space Chimps             ,DICK STEEL,,animation,2008,7,"I'm going to admit that I've enjoyed Space Chimps. No, I've not gone bananas, but there's something beautiful to this goofy animated comedy that appealed, perhaps in its simplicity and its not attempting to try and be more than it cannot be. Ham III (voiced by Andy Samberg). a circus monkey whose the key to the ""monkey cannonball"" act, happens to be the descendant of its decorated ancestor Ham I, the first monkey to have entered outer space. As NASA does send animals early in their history of missions to perform certain tests, and more so as guinea pigs, their current space programme is under threat of being axed, unless of course the scientists can all prove their worth. Just so happens that a space probe gets send to the opposite side of a wormhole, that it presents an opportunity to send a crack team of animals to the other side as well to test waters, hence the assembly of our merry animals.You have Ham III, the reluctant astronaut put into the team for some PR purpose, who joins the usual caricatures of team captain and beefcake Titan, as well as beautiful Luna, who provides the brains for the mission and cursory love interest for our protagonist chimp. On the ground, besides the wacky human scientists who always deny their nerd status, you have Comet and Houston, fellow chimps who provide ground expertise to our crew's mission in space. Truth is, and a departure in animated movies of late, this one is sans big name stars or voice talent, and doesn't detract you away from the story, nor have one talent steal the thunder from the rest. Like a well oiled space mission, Space Chimps is and plays out like a consolidated team effort.The adversary they face are a group of silly aliens under the control of Zartog, who consolidated his power no thanks to the human space probe by hitting the manual override button, as well as various environmental challenges reminiscent of the latest Journey to the Center of the Earth, and provides ample opportunity for some pretty wacky characters, with set action pieces like swinging from vine to vine, making more sense here when compared to that in The Crystal Skull.The graphics here are kept simple and uncomplicated. It's easy to find fault with so many things in this movie, given the likes of Pixar which has set the benchmark, but as I've said, I'm not looking for too much, and the simplicity of it all in Space Chimps makes it a refreshing breath of fresh air. The story at times might find itself hard pressed to throw in some wisecracks on pop culture, but there are indeed moments to have it in the movie so subtly, you'll probably blink and you miss it. If you're willing to leave your 1% intellect at the door, perhaps you may just enjoy this movie about primates that exhibit similar emotions and attributes to our own."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,jsmith-348,0,animation,2008,7,"Still wondering about the reviews above that insult this film's animation. I thought it looked terrific. (For the record, nearly every professional critic I could find singled out the film's strong visuals.) The character differentiation is very strong in the mice & rats -- and all that tender-loving detail in Ratworld and Mouseworld! You'd have to watch the movie 6 times to pick out all the tiny man-made objects the rodents have used for furniture, clothing, etc.I see also several reviewers' concerns about the film's ""darkness."" Ummm . . . don't we find Hans Christian Andersen a bit dark too? Isn't there something about kids being baked in an oven? And doesn't someone's father die in ""Lion King""? And a certain famous mother in that deer movie . . . ? For the matter of that, fans of DiCamillo's Newbery-winning book can tell that her version is a lot darker -- heart-breaking at times. At least one critic has scolded the film version for toning down the darkness, which concomitantly weakens DiCamillo's message of forgiveness and redemption.AND: I don't think I've ever heard vocal work this good in an animated film. They're not big box-office names that will draw tons of kids to the picture, but real pros -- Hoffman, Ullman, Hinds, Watson, and that narration by Sigourney!! -- who bring an amazing richness and authenticity to the characterizations.Plus, any movie that so convincingly counsels little kids to say ""I'm sorry"" -- well, even if it had no other merits, it's hard to argue with a message like that!

Australia             ,fertilecelluloid,1,adventure,2008,2,"Australia is a big country with skies and deserts that go on forever. The film of the same name is a big pile of cinematic excrement that should not have even started, let alone been allowed to go on for as long as it does. Baz Luhrmann, possibly the most overrated director in the world, was given $180 million to create this overwrought, schmaltzy garbage starring ice queen Nicole Kidman and bland-as-batsh*t Hugh Jackman. Fancying himself as the reborn David Lean, he went for epic and got Epic Stinker. He throws in the Australian government's disgraceful treatment of its indigenous people, a romance, a cattle drive, the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese, and a subplot involving a little boy with parents of both colors. The result is a mess. The CGI of cattle racing towards their doom is completely unconvincing and the bombing of Darwin, which can only be described as 'Pearl Harbor Lite', is directed with spastic indecision. As a romance, it's a complete failure. As history, it's totally shallow. As social commentary, it's all surface. If Luhrmann is doing anything as a filmmaker (in addition to running his career with one ballet shoe firmly in the closet), he's channeling the spirit of the late, great Liberace with his over-the-top bonanzas of glitter, camp and intolerable clichés. Unlike Liberace, he doesn't know when to stop playing. ""Australia"", by any measure, is a massive helping of Terrible that would make even dear old Liberace nauseous. 1"
Lakeview Terrace             ,Craig_McPherson,0,crime,2008,6,"Neil LaBute has built his portfolio breathing life into movies and stage plays about dysfunctional individuals (usually men) who have difficulty fitting into relationships and societal norms. His first offering, 1997's In the Company of Men, earned him praise for his stark tale of two misogynist businessmen who conspire to romantically destroy a deaf woman, and is play ""Bash: Latter Day Plays"" earned him excommunication from the Church of Latter Day Saints for its unflattering portrayal of Mormons.With Lakeview Terrace, LaBute opts for the unconventional exploration of black-on-white and black-on-black prejudice with uneven results.Samuel L. Jackson plays Abel Turner, a veteran Los Angeles cop and single parent struggling to raise his two young kids. Turner's life has been scarred and ruptured by the death of his wife, who was killed in a car accident with her white lover while engaging in an affair <U+0096> something that understandably has been festering in Turner's craw for some time.When the purchasers of the house next door turn out to be a racially mixed couple, Turner begins transposing his hatred on them as proxies for his wife's transgressions.Initially Turner's intimidating ways seem focused on bullying his new ""liberal"" neighbors into maintaining decorum and giving his kids a wide berth, but things soon progress into unstable territory as his years of being an alpha male with a gun and a badge begin to get the better of him. With each successful intimidation, Turner becomes emboldened to become a law unto himself.LaBute frames Turner's exploits against the backdrop of an escalating brushfire in the neighboring hills, which serves as metaphor for Turner's growing inner rage that threatens to consume the property and lives of everyone involved. LaBute's execution has all the subtlety of a gun butt to the head, which may actually have been his intention, given how he likely figured the audience would be comprised of escapist, action-seeking types not generally known for reflecting upon humanity's shortcomings.Jackson does everything asked of him as he shows the progression of what at first seems to be a well-intentioned and loving parent, into an unbridled bully. The problem comes in the film's final act as the story culminates in forced cacophony that pushes the boundary of believability over the edge. A small dose of well timed restraint would have transformed this movie from a semi-decent popcorn muncher into a more serious vehicle for reflection on human values and prejudices."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,WatchIsWasteOfTime,1,comedy,2014,1,"For starters, sorry for my English but I am not a native  but suffering by watching this movie made me to write a review. I have never seen such a boring film/story in my entire live. Don't want to blame the producers/director of the film  they made their money I assume, but it was really awful, even the attempts to slapstick were horrible. All characters are empty jars, it is all quite predictable. Well, thats not unusual in a romantic comedy, but here it is just way too much. In the beginning there is shown the genitals of the main character 3 times - or maybe a dummy of them, and you are asking yourself: why the h... is that necessary? Is that supposed to be funny? The story dabbles on and on, he is left by her, he is a real lame duck, anyhow he manages to get a lot of quite beautiful women in his bed trying to forget his ex with sex - what never works out and what in the meantime is common knowledge to every hillbilly. Nothing will help, so he is going on vacation at a resort in Hawaii - and nice coincidence - accidentally his ex-girlfriend is in the same resort with her really dummy of a rock star-boyfriend and on and on ... horrible. Rather not necessary to say that he stays all the time a real sissy. Strongly recommended - not."

He is not a one may show in YES MAN, the other characters do there share of the comedy.As usual there is a love interest & the marvelous Zooey Deschanel is it this time,Her role is nearly as crazy as his is. As I have said prior about her, she will be a big star soon, she has talent to spare.Peyton Reed directed this from the screenplay by Nicholas Stollen,Jared Paul & Andrew Mogel; The adapted the non-fiction book by Danny Wallace.Adding to the comic hi-jinx are Bradley Cooper, John Micheal Higgins,Rhys Darby & Danny Masterson as his buddies.Terrance Stamp who has been a STAR since his first role BILLY BUDD in 1962,is well cast & as always you can believe what he says.I thoroughly enjoyed this & I think you all will as well. Be sure to say to the credits, as there is one additional stunt scene that is quite exciting.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10) ++++ farces such as this rarely get a higher ratin"
Hancock             ,sean-osburn,0,action,2008,2,I felt he was an emotionless character again like the movie with the undead people. I was unimpressed with his performance in this film. the sudden plot twist was just not believable. I give this film a 3 and a ##Boring## !! on the fun meter. Come on Will Smith! You can do better.Will smith needs to focus on making films that do not put the watcher or the audience to sleep. I did not like this film. I thought they really hyped it up as an amazing idea and film.. and it fell short and fizzled out. I enjoyed I robot. An inventive awesome idea and plot but this film fell flat and was a major let down and disappointment to me. I expected more from a man such as this that has such a good following and billing.

The Tale of Despereaux             ,trint,0,animation,2008,10,"I understand the less than stellar reviews from some. This movie is not Toy Story or Madagascar. Don't expect to see Buzz Lightyear kitsch, or Shrek fart-jokes. It is a fairy tale of the finest sort.I am a long time fan of CGI animation, since the days before Pixar was a household name (and I do love Toy Story). The artistry and technical achievements in this film leave me speechless. The characters emoted better than many live-action films. (They did seem to cut a couple of corners on non-critical characters. The cat was pretty bad by comparison, but it's only in two scenes.) The feel is very literary, as it should be. And you get the feeling they made some sacrifices to get the book to the screen. (Don't they always?) The film makes me want to read the book and see what I missed. Still, the story stands well on it's own.The voice talent (What a star packed cast!!) was held in check allowing the story to shine through. You don't find yourself thinking, ""Hey, it's Robin Williams!"" or ""Hey, it's Mike Meyers!"" (Thank God!) Instead, you enjoy the characters and only momentarily think, ""I know that voice."" It may be too cerebral (read ""old skool"") for some of today's iPod, Dragon Ball Z, Nintendo DS, 24/7 non-stop stimulation generation, but it's exactly the kind of story they need."
Death Race             ,ma-cortes,0,action,2009,6,"The picture is set in the near future (2012), there the ultimate sporting is the Death Race where contestants get score points for running drivers down and sacrificing themselves. It's a futurist international sport , a violent and bloody car race where the drivers score points for hitting other vehicles. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is the hero behind the wheel, posing as Frankestein, and his nemesis the various killers drivers. He's a good guy wrongly accused of killing and locked on Terminal island. Jensen is coerced by warden Hennessey(Joan Allen) to enter Death Race , a gladiator-like televised fight-to death. A race against dangerous prisoner-drivers, as Machine Gun Mason (Tyrese Gibson), Pachenko (Max Ryan), Gunner (Jacob Vargas) and several others (Robin Shou, Robert LaSardo). Jensen is helped by coach (Ian McShane) and accompanied by a gorgeous eye-popping youngster (a sexy girl Natalie Martinez).This exciting movie is full of noisy action, moving scenes , thrills, chills and lots of violence. Spectacular race cars with skillful stunts and barely computer generator effects. From the beginning to the end the unstopped action and the emotions are interminable. Stirring and lively musical score by Paul Haslinger along with a colorful cinematography by Scott Kevan . The motion picture is professionally directed , produced and written by Paul W. S. Anderson ,a noted producer and director of super-productions ( Resident Evil saga, Alien Vs Predator, Soldier, Event Horizont, Mortal combat). It's based on the classic B movie (1975) with the same title directed by Paul Bartel with David Carradine, Simone Griffeth and Sylvester Stallone , a cult favorite that here is correctly adapted adding much more action and violence. Nowadays Paul W. S. Anderson is preparing its following with similar technician and artist equipmen"
Surveillance             ,gavin6942,1,crime,2010,7,"A pair of serial killers is on the loose, and their latest hotspot is Nebraska. When the FBI investigates, they find that all the witnesses have conflicting stories and are leaving out parts that make them look bad.Jennifer Lynch is not her father, and it is not fair to her for everyone to compare them. However, for those who are concerned, this is not on the level of David Lynch (but few things are). In its own right, it's a very entertaining and suspenseful film, and it might keep you guessing until the end. For the first half, we are only given a small part of the story, and it works well... I just had to know the rest.Bill Pullman is fantastic as always (though he's beginning to show his age). I can't see anyone else in the role. Julia Ormond is not familiar to me, but she is also excellent. Cheri Oteri and French Stewart did a great job in serious, and in Stewart's case menacing, roles... a nice adjustment from their past.I haven't seen anyone compare this film to the crimes of Charles Starkweather (which inspired ""Natural Born Killers""), which strikes me as odd. Two killers driving through Nebraska? Seems like a connection... but then, maybe I'm just crazy.This film is worth seeing and a fine piece of work. It may not be remembered in a few years (it has already begun to fade quickly), but hopefully word of mouth keeps the attention on it for a while."
I Sell the Dead             ,kosmasp,,misc,2010,8,"The story has been told in other movies too. But the way it is handled here (with the humor) seems far superior to other movies (even a recent one, made by Landis). The story is more or less told in a reverse way, which makes you wonder a few things (or maybe you will guess where it is heading quite early on).The acting is really great and even the small role by Mr. Pearlman is just great. You couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role. He really is on par with Dominic M., who just is great in this one. There is life after ""LotR"" and ""Lost"" after all. And he is one of the guys who can say he made the most of it (not to mention his engagement with the wonderful Evangeline Lilly)"
W.             ,MovieDude1893,0,misc,2009,4,"W.- *½/**** Oliver Stone's W. is an oddity. There's no other word for it. In attempting to provide psychological commentary on the presidency of George W. Bush, it forgets the simple cinematic basics of story, structure and character. The tone of the film is nearly non existent, leaving its admirable cast of actors on shaky ground without a leg to stand on.Stone juxtaposes the rise of ""Dubya"" (played by Josh Brolin) with his decision to begin the current Iraq War. In displaying Bush's journey from frat boy to drunk to born again AA member to leader of the free world, Stone has enough material to create a wicked absurdist satire, or compelling political theater. However, Stone seems hell-bent on making a film that remains neutral toward the forty- third President, giving him the ability to say things like, ""It will contain surprises for Bush supporters and his detractors.""# Well, yes, I was surprised indeed. Surprised that the man who's made films as vibrant and lively as JFK and Natural Born Killers, as somber and emotional as Platoon or Born on the Fourth of July has rendered this film completely dull and lifeless.Perhaps Stone isn't completely to blame. Stanley Weiser's script, bland and talky in the worst possible way, contains figures instead of characters, and when put into scenes these figure say exactly what should be shown in outlets other than dialog removing any hope for subtlety.I do know this, the film's failure is certainly not the fault of the cast which includes actors as esteemed as Richard Dreyfuss and Ellen Burstyn. By and large (with the exception of Thandie Newton's dreadful aping of Condoleezza Rice) the cast excels at inhabiting the situation. This is especially true for Brolin who's performance is so complete and convincing that it overshadows the entire film and underlines the numerous flaws. Beyond physical inhabitation and imitation, Brolin's performance shows a deep understanding of Dubya as a man, I wish I could say the same about the film."
Kisses             ,Ron Plasma,1,drama,2009,NA,"All very Ken Loach, (before he discovered FC United!), but nevertheless a charming, short film. Dylan & Kylie, (a fabulous, if mismatching pair of character names), were sweet in their own brow-beaten way, and all credit to Lance Daly for sticking with the sometime impenetrable dialogue.Never mind. Credit also to Kelly O'Neill (especially) and Shane Curry for demonstrating that acting is much more than just words. But what I loved was the fact that the whole feel-good aspect of the film could be attributable to <U+0085>. Heelys!

Bedtime Stories             ,cnet,0,adventure,2008,8,"We went to this movie with my two kids (ages 7 and 10, both girls), my Brother-in-law and his wife and their two kids (ages six and nine, both boys.) We were a bit apprehensive about this due to the poor critics ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. (Frankly, the critics gave it abysmal ratings and I almost avoided this entirely because of those ratings.) And perhaps they were right. But I know that despite the critics we all enjoyed it greatly. Maybe it was just the mood we were all in or the good meal we just had before the movie but we laughed throughout. Obviously there is no high-brow humor here or social commentary to be made. It's just a movie who's sole purpose is simply to have fun. Cookie cutter? Perhaps. In fact, in retrospect I'm sure it was. But it was still enjoyable.So if your looking for something more than what you see in the previews, forget it. It isn't happening. This movie makes no pretenses about what it is exactly about: good fun. If your looking for anything other than that, you're going to be disappointed.On the down side, some of the best moments were captured in the previews. While this certainly isn't the first movie to this (not the last I'm sure), it always seems to take something away from the experience of watching the movie. But there were plenty of other twists and turns in this movie that helped minimize the effect this had on the overall viewing experience.Overall this movie was a delight for kids both big and small in our group. You'll enjoy it if you watch it with a child's eye...and not those big ones Bugsy has!!!"
Bolt             ,inkblot11,0,animation,2008,8,"Bolt the dog (voiced by John Travolta) is the star of an espionage television series. His owner, teenager Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is his co-star. On the show, Bolt possesses ""super"" powers and is able to stop trucks with his paws, start explosions with his ""stare"" and outrun the bad guys. However, he lives on the set, in his own trailer, and never leaves the premises, not even to go home for the weekend with Penny. Consequently, he is unaware that he is an ordinary dog but, instead, he truly believes he is a superdog. Therefore, on the day that two pestering cats entice him to leave his trailer, he finds himself out in the ""real"" world. After a mishap, he ends up in a delivery truck to New York City, far away from Hollywood. Still thinking his special skills will get him home pronto, he is in for a rude awakening. But, through the help of a stray cat named Mittens (Susie Essmann) and a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walters), he begins the long cross-country journey. Will he make it? This film was cute and fun, with very nice animation and a clever script. There is a touch of violence, especially at the beginning, for the world of the superhero is rarely without danger, even on a television show. So, perhaps the film is unsuitable for the very youngest viewers. However, the cast is wonderful, with Travolta doing an excellent job as the voice of Bolt. Cyrus, too, is touching in her role as Penny, while Essmann and Walters are really superb additions to the film. All of the lesser characters are voiced very nicely, too, especially Malcolm McDowell as the pipes of the main heavy. The animation is colorful, skillful and very realistic, resulting in an attractive movie. Then, too, the score is quite fine, with Travolta and Cyrus doing a duet near the film's end. All in all, if you care about quality films for families, bolt out the door and arrange a viewing of Bolt. Everyone will be yapping with delight as the film runs its course"
Trucker             ,A_Different_Drummer,1,drama,2013,NA,"Q1: Is Michelle Monaghan the ultimate woman? (Only men need answer, or try to). The question is asked seriously, and, you will shortly learn, lies at the heart of this venture, in its DNA, if you will. Monaghan's roles usually lean in that direction. In Mission Impossible, she was Tom Cruise' only vulnerability, and to rescue/avenge her he was willing to risk a world war. In Source Code, Jake Gyllenhaal was willing to bend the very fabric of Space and Time just to be with her; in Made of Honor Patrick Dempsey not only was willing to let go of his swinging bachelor life but almost invaded Scotland to win her; and in Shane Black's KISS KISS BANG BANG she was the ultimate prize, the lost love from your childhood that Robert Downey was granted one final chance at. Against this backdrop, we start to see where this film came from. Either Monaghan or her agent (pick one) was getting concerned over this trend and decided to put her in a ""real"" part, cast against type, to show that she can play more than one role.Q2: Does the film work? Yes and no. Yes Michelle can act, and all the players do a fine job of playing parts so gritty you can practically smell the perspiration. Nathan Fillion strays outside his comfort zone  which is TV  and does a nice job. Benjamin Bratt, a generally under-deployed resource, steals every scene he is in. Which is not too hard, because the script and director keep everything on a low boil for pretty much the entire time.Q3. Does Monaghan's character have Aspbergers? This was not an issue when the film was made, but with the benefit of hindsight, this would explain a lot. If you think so, tell your friends on the Aspie boards.Q4. Do we really care if Monaghan's body of work will be remembered as skewing to the same role over and over? The real secret of TRUCKER, a fine little film in its own right, is that Monaghan was (and arguably still is) brilliant at playing the ""coveted heroine"" role and, if it ain't broke, you probably shouldn't try to fix it. In this context, TRUCKER becomes less an indie drama and more a guilty pleasure for Monaghan's legion of fans. Male fans,we should add. But you already guessed tha"
Frozen River             ,axlgarland,1,crime,2008,9,"How extraordinary to find a forty-something actress you've never seen or heard about before and being blown away by her. Her name is Melissa Leo and I believe she is here to stay. She gives the most powerful performance I've seen all year. She managed to slip into my subconscious and I find myself thinking about her (about her character) as I do someone I truly care about. That in itself is a major achievement. A first time director, Courtney Hunt, gives this character and this actress a remarkable space to breath and grow. The gelid landscape envelopes the desolate story but there is a human warmth devoid of sentimentality that makes ""Frozen River"" a welcome rarity. Moving, suspenseful, not to be missed. 1"
Nim's Island             ,the-gossip-king,1,adventure,2008,7,While on holidays I managed to see this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. I have never liked Breslin but she is at her best in this movie and Jodie Foster will always be the magnificent Jodie Foster. Gerard Butler was also very funny and had me cracking up which is something a family movie has not made me do in a while. The story is good and witty and the movie is very family friendly. I think older teens would be bored because although I enjoyed it the story was a bit predictable at times. Overall I was very happy with the movie and would recommend it first and foremost as a family movies. Kids will love it and adults will be thoughtful enough to enjoy it.

I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero ""jump-in-your-seat"" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD. "

Death Race             ,helmutty,0,action,2008,6,"As many comic books, games and original movies are being remade, director Paul W.S. Anderson is not new to those remakes. He adapted Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat and AVP. Now he remakes the original movie Death race 2000. Not surprising. While watching this movie, I realised that he still has his habit of making games plots. Death race plot is quite similar to those racing or survival games plot. It reminds me of DOA (Dead Or Alive) which Paul produce. The story: Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for murdering his wife. He is then sent to jail. Hennessey (Joan Allen) picks him to join the brutal surviving game. He has to kill the other inmates who join the game. The prize is to get his freedom. Every inmate will get his own partner. The partners are mostly some hot chicks. From there, exciting vehicles chases scenes and blood ooze out. There isn't much gore but there are blood and language. The plot is so simple but the idea and the chase scenes make my heart pound. It is like watching a survival game unfolding by itself.It just explode the screen and your time and nothing else. And you won't care about the plot, you will just care about the thrilling game. Overall: Those expecting a move to kill time, this is one. Those who want to watch another ""The Dark Knight"" movie, this is not the movie. It is not bad for mindless action flick."
Shutter             ,Robert_duder,0,horror,2008,9,"As far as I'm concerned The Ring (remake--and the original really) is the scariest film I've ever seen. It just downright creeped me out and ever since then I've been all for the barrage of Japanese remakes that Hollywood has churned out even if some of them haven't been great. The Grudge was okay, most recently Jessica Alba's The Eye (see my reviews) and there have been not so great sequels and remakes as well from the Japanese or Asian films but I knew Shutter looked good and I'm so glad I checked it out because I think this is one of the top ones from the genre that they've done since the grudge. The entire film just has this eerie quality about it and even though it does have some cheap thrillers, scares, loud noises, it also really tries to get under your skin which I love about these types of films when you just get that eerie chill down your spine and Shutter does that. It deals with all the paranormal and eerie aspects of a haunting ghost story and even throws in a killer twist to boot although perhaps a little predictable I think you do see it coming but it doesn't make the film any less watchable. I happen to think Shutter is a downright brilliant horror thriller.I really like Joshua Jackson, and even during Dawson's Creek I thought he had potential and for the first time I think he really shows his adult acting chops in Shutter. He's a great lead in the film and you can almost let go his teenage persona from his younger years. I think this will really open up some doors for him because he's great at it. I would love to see him come back for a sequel if they ever did one. Beautiful Rachael Taylor is Jackson's newlywed wife Jane. She is probably even more the main character getting even more screen time which is nice because she is EASY and then some to look at. Despite her near picture perfect appearance she still has a very down to earth quality and you follow the mystery with her much the way you did with Naomi Watts in The Ring. She does a great job and her and Jackson are hot together and very believable. Together they make a terrific combo and add to the already great feel of the film. Megumi Okina plays the haunting gal from beyond the grave. She is appropriately eerie and adds even more human qualities to the seeming monster killer so that it feels even more real. David Denman, and John Hensley play small roles as Jackson's best friends and they both do a decent job in those roles although are kind of overshadowed by the stand out performances by Jackson and Taylor.Korean Director Masayuki Ochiai makes his American debut and he obviously has a clear grip on suspense and an intriguing story in any language. He does a really great job at the overall ambiance of the film and uses stereotypical but nonetheless terrifying settings like the abandoned buildings, and images in pictures and such. The film just will make you creep with the feeling that you're being watched through a camera nonetheless. Shutter lives up to it's name by really making the camera the focal point of this mystery and how to solve it. The story is really interesting and even though I had my suspicions of how the mystery would end it didn't make it any less enjoyable. I wouldn't say that Shutter is gory or really brutal although it does have it's moments but it really does go for the thrills and any great fan of this genre of film will LOVE Shutter. I think it's just awesome!! 9/1"
Quarantine             ,Simon_Says_Movies,1,horror,2008,7,"Even at a glance, it is clear that Quarantine has boarded the 'fad' bandwagon it two respects. Firstly, this chiller joins up with the abundance of remakes that choke the gullet of Hollywood, and at an impressively rapid pace I may add, duplicating its Spanish predecessor (Rec) within a year's time. Secondly, it is the successor in a line of films, some from earlier this year in fact, that adopt the hand-held camera technique (which may soon be classified more accurately as a gimmick) to construct a first hand, real time account of events. Yet, despite succumbing to these popular fixations, and the flag of death that is the studios reluctance to screen the film, Quarantine is crisp effective horror.When comparing (Rec) and Quarantine, the similarities are glaring. In fact, the films are almost identical, save a few altered snippets. Which is good in the sense that nothing was lost in translation and although nowhere near as disgraceful as remaking classics or art films, it still begs to ask the question why? Alas, the average viewer does not wish to read subtitles, especially when watching horror, so the update went through. Directed by newcomer John Erick Dowdle he makes the most of his debut. Procuring a larger budget then its inspiration, Quarantine looks better as a whole (despite more frequent incomprehensible shots involving darkness and jiggle cam) and is able to incorporate some effects into the production, such as a continuous and chilling shot of a person being tossed down a stairwell. Comparisons to 2008's earlier films Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead are unavoidable, and remains squarely in the middle; a far-cry from the ingenuity and atmosphere of Cloverfield, but avoids the horrendous acting and scripting of Diary.Mirroring (Rec) Quarantine begins with a reporter, Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) who hosts a late night television program. On this particular night, Angela and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) are doing a ride-along with the firemen of a local station in L.A., including Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Jonathan Schaech). After a tenuous night of boredom and anxiety, they are finally called to the scene of an apparent accident in an aging condo, involving an elderly tenant. Things are not as they seem however as soon after, the CDC seals off the building with the foursome, and the reaming residents still inside. Their reasoning is good it seems, as all hell breaks loose as a mysterious rabies virus rips through the building turning those exposed into zombie-like fiends. The survivors must work together to battle the infected, the authorities and each other.Both films incorporate the inherent problem of the disease itself, which seems to frequently shift in its required incubation period, but is not really a huge impediment for the film as a whole. The opening act which is situated entirely at the station is both surprisingly involving and witty, and works to some extent as character development. The finale is also pulse-pounding, if not entirely inspired, but lacks the sheer terror I felt at the finale of (Rec). When breaking it down, Quarantine's opening is better then the original, and (Rec)'s final act is better then its imitator, so things balance out. Each film boast a superb scene mid to late film, including the aforementioned stairwell plummet in Quarantine and a scene in (Rec]) involving the same stairwell in which the heroes peer down to see the lower floors of infected peering back; eerie stuff. I would encourage horror fans to see both before making their choice, and to be honest I haven't quite chosen myself which is superior. Regardless, Quarantine takes advantage of a ploy that has not yet become stale, and yielding authentic portrayals from its relatively unknown cast and an ominous atmosphere, this flick is infectious to be sure.See all my reviews at: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com "
The Burning Plain             ,bob-rutzel-1,1,misc,2010,7,"The Burning Plain (2009) Charlize Theron, Kim Basinger, J.D. Prado, Jennifer LawrenceGood StoryThis is a two-tiered story. You see the present as Sylvia (Theron) and the past as Mariana (still Sylvia, but known as Mariana). Sylvia is rocked by a confrontation with her past.This is not as confusing as it seems. Until you catch on this is presented as though all is in the present, but it's not. Almost like a time space continuum, isn't it? The present is when Sylvia has decisions to make as she is shocked when reminded of her time long ago when she was Mariana. I know you will get it. Took me a while too.Good story, but a little too much almost graphic sex. We get it and don't need to see and hear all of it. Get it? Good story but the two people we really didn't care about was married Gina (Basinger) and her new lover. Something was missing with these two. Yes, we kept hoping they would get caught. Good story and the two we did care about was Carlos (Prado) and Mariana (the young Sylvia, remember?). Their chemistry was gold.Good story and it all hinged on Theron (Sylvia and the young Mariana but played by Jennifer Lawrence) who continues to impress with an Oscar worthy performance.

The Tale of Despereaux             ,Hrothgar50,0,animation,2009,7,"Although this was not what some would consider a masterpiece of cinema, I though it was great; one of the best kids movies I have seen in a very long time. It was a good tale which taught good principles. There were no adult jokes, fart humor, or any of that nonsense. It did what fairy-tales once did: give hope and inspiration to the less-fortunate while stressing good values. This is what children need more of, not mindless humor meant to please the adults in the crowd. Yeah, the animation wasn't exceptional; but it did have a surreal classic art feel at times. I loved it and will recommend it to my customers. Working at a video store has it's perks. I hope many who would have otherwise turned away will give it a chanc"
Gran Torino             ,anton_malmberg,0,drama,2009,5,"I saw this film a couple of days ago. Clint Eastwood does (as always) an amazing job on the screen. Sadly he is also almost the only one with a major part doing a good job. Most of the conversations are awkward and very stiff. I actually had to turn away a few times because the situation became so very embarrassing. Sadly, Clint Eastwood is the only one on screen that keeps you from not walking away from it. Bee Wang and Ahney Her ,who are both totally unknown to me, both have major parts in this film. They are both doing among the worst acting jobs ever and should take acting classes before going on screen with one of the greatest. The story line does not come with any surprises, and you can pretty much figure out most of the twists and turns as the film goes on."
Deception             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,crime,2008,7,"When I first saw the trailer to Deception, I was intrigued, but a little put off, we haven't had a thriller release in theaters that was actually good in a while, let alone a sexy thriller. But I saw Deception on Sunday and I think the rating on IMDb is a little harsh to be honest, this was such a cool, sexy, and sleek thriller, true, it was a little predictable if you've seen every thriller possible, but Deception kept me interested and had a good story with an equally strong cast. I was a little disappointed in the ending, it seemed like they could've had something a little stronger with Hugh and Ewan, like they would've been a great pair of trouble makers for the world to watch out for. But it was also cool to see the female fetal back, which we rarely see, and Michelle Williams was a great choice, she had the looks and the talent to pull this movie together with the two strong male leads.Jonathan is an accountant, one of the best, but his life is just what you expect of an accountant: boring, typical, and no ladies, but he meets Wyatt, a handsome, strong, successful lady's man, they become best friends immediately. When Jonathan accidentally grabs Wyatt's cell phone, Wyatt is in a different country, so Jonathan uses the cell and gets involved with a sex club. He meets S, a mysterious girl he just falls for, but when she is ""kidnapped"", he gets in a lot deeper than he expects and doesn't realize the set up he fell for.Deception is predictable in some ways, the ending, if you are used to these thrillers, yes, you're going to be able to see what's coming, sad, I know, but I'm so used to it that I'm just accepting it. I thought this was still a clever thriller, I just loved Hugh's performance, he was so into his character, he made it sexy and creepy. Ewan pulls in a decent performance and stands strong, the ending is his peek in the film and Michelle was just great as S. Deception is a cool thriller I highly recommend, it's a sexy movie that won't leave you disappointed.7/10 "
Sex and the City             ,zafulotus,1,comedy,2008,1,"It was so awful it defies description. If you are really a ""true fan""... you will leave quite bitter and feeling used. The movie literally contains plot lines that revolve around poop and fat jokes. Literally. Poop jokes and fat jokes. Oh, and a petulant 40 year old who responds to being disappointed by/in her partner by cutting him out of her life for a year and looking to her friends to be her mommies. Mature.SATC was on my last year in high school through my college years and into my mid-20s. Needless to say, the show meant a lot to me in those formative years. I've since grown up to be a feminist and professional and look back fondly on the revolutionary nature of the series. Even in its moments of fluff and vanity, there were redeeming aspects to the self-reflection and (sometimes reluctant) self-reliance of these women. No, it's not perfect... but it was challenging and eye-opening in its milieu. To then go see this movie is an insult. Much like as I did in my late teens and early-to-mid 20's, I expected a mature movie that examined the lives of these 40-somethings in a way that would offer some insight (and wit) into what I might come to expect in the years to come as I get older, live with my partner, maybe get married, maybe have babies, maybe adopt, maybe leave a partner, maybe face infidelity, etc... something that honored the promise that it was a smart movie that gave these mature women something to sink their acting chops into...Instead I got a wedding farce; a humping dog; stock black, Jewish and gay characters that literally made me feel ill; 4 women who don't know themselves any better than they did 4 years ago, 10 years ago; and, oh yeah, POOP JOKES AND FAT JOKES.SATC the TV series WAS a cultural icon, a touchstone, a movement.SATC the movie promotes itself as a vehicle for creating another socio-cultural rupture. Instead its witless. 2"
Deception             ,3xHCCH,0,crime,2008,5,"I went into the theater because of the interesting star combination of Hiugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor. I did not have an idea what the story would be about. However, the simple (and unimaginative) title was a give-away of the plot. Within the first ten minutes, you already feel you have seen this movie before. I immediately thought of the Clive Owen-Jennifer Aniston movie ""Derailed."" (The initial chance seduction occurred at a train station, as well.) John McQuarrie (Ewan McGregor) is a lonely accountant/auditor with zero social life. He gets hooked into a sex ""list"" by the magnetic man's man Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman). There he meets the girl of his dreams simply known to him as ""S"" (Michelle Williams). Of course, since the title gives away the plot, you knew this set-up was all an elaborate deception, and nothing is really what it seemed.As for the plot, there were a lot of improbabilities that weaken the story (some spoilers follow later for those interested). The suspense was a bit muted because the director was generous with the clues. Or may be we have just watched to many of these variations of this story in movies.The sex ""list"" set-up (which was the main thing of interest that set this movie apart from others like it) was most likely inspired by real such social clubs. These lurid circles where busy people just call each other randomly for some anonymous commitment-free sex, I am sure, ordinary guys like us will never get mixed up with in real life. This movie does give us a vicarious teasing peek into this alternative lifestyle, though.I did like the triumph of good at the end though, because there were no strings attached.I could not help but compare this film with ""Derailed"" because they were so similar, and ""Derailed"" was clearly better in all aspects. That said, this film ""Deception"" is really not that bad as the cheap local posters (that resort to sexy photos of girls in lingerie) would suggest.***********SPOILERS FOLLOW************** These are the questions that the movie requires you to turn a blind eye on: How could Bose possibly assume that McQuarrie would do his criminal bidding just because of ""S""? At that time, McQuarrie had only met ""S"" twice, and they did not even have sex yet. And indeed, can an auditor actually gain access to perform multi-million dollar money transfers from the company he is auditing? Also, is it that easy to create fake passports? Especially in the case of McQuarrie."
Gomorrah             ,MacAindrais,,crime,2008,10,"Gomorra (2008) **** Much of Gomorra takes place in and around a crumbling housing project, that in establishing shots looks as if it were a rotting labyrinth pyramid. The very structure of the film's slums serves itself as a visual metaphor for the Camorra crime institution in Naples. It's a bureaucratic shuffle, rivaling a large capitalist corporation, equally ruthless but in different senses of the term. Their products are drugs, extortion, and toxic sludge. Their version of corporate take-over involves murderously shameless acts of extreme violence.Matteo Garrone deftly directs Gomorra, based on the novel of the same name by Roberto Saviano. It contains a labyrinth plot serving to depict a labyrinth lifestyle. One storyline focuses on a young boy, Toto, who lives in that decaying pyramid, and wants to join up with the gangsters who run it. By the end of the film, his youth will be shattered, and he'll have done things to those around him that would have seemed unthinkable before. He's the ground soldier in the gangster empire.Don Ciro is an aging money runner, delivering rations to the families of mob prisoners. He gets increasingly caught between the war between factions within the complexes, and before long takes to wearing a bullet proof vest in fear of his own safety.Roberto is a college graduate, given a high profile job working with Franco, who runs a scheme disposing of garbage and waste from the city by burying it in the countryside - a move that has sent the cancer rate in the countryside through the roof. Roberto must face his own conscious as he becomes more and more aware of the corruption of work.Pasquale is a talented designer, who's put to work by his friend and boss completing a contract for dresses in less time than he and the workers should like. At great personal risk to himself, he takes an offer from a Chinese factory boss to gives lessons to his workers. The job means crossing the Comorra, so he is hidden in the trunk on the drive to the factory, with a modified hole behind the backseat so he can stick his head out to breath and chat.The other storyline follows two Scarface-wannabes who long to be the crime bosses of all bosses. They cross the local boss by stealing drugs from dealers, causing trouble, then by stealing weapons from a mob cache, raising Cain. They are knuckle-heads, a couple of kids too stupid to see the truth behind the phony glorification of the gangster lifestyle.That phony glorification is entirely absent here. Garrone observes his gangsters with an eye of contempt. There is no Robin Hood imagery in Gomorra. It puts on full display the ruthlessness of the gangster culture. It's a gangster as capitalist world, one where turning to killing kids or a woman is looked down upon, but not off-limits.The film starts off with a fantastic sequence of tanning machines and surprisingly graphic murder, which would lead one to think that they were moving headlong into a Scorsese-like blood bath of macabre. You'd be wrong though. Gomorra is a very patient film, slowly unraveling its stories. It's clearly influenced by the early Italian Neo-Realists, and also has elements that reminded me of the gangster pictures of Jean-Pierre Melville. Garrone shoots in a documentary style with hand-held camera shots. It jumps between its story lines with utmost patience, which might slow down the film's pace more than many would like or are accustomed to. If you do not realize the scope of the Camorra's activity in nearly all facets of commercial and communal life in and around Naples, the connection between the stories may seem unclear. But that's one of the main services of the picture, to show us just how entrenched the mafia has remained in parts of Italy.Although mob movies are a dime a dozen, Gamorra enters as a gangster epic with freshness. It's a very European film, and as far as gangster pictures go, with its no nonsense documentary style, and only slowly escalating violence and patience it feels like a unique addition to the genre. Gomorra is sure to split, maybe even downright annoy audiences looking for something more conventional. It defies at least most of the genre's clichés, and aims high with its quiet ambitions.Gomorra won the Grand Prix at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and has been slotted as Italy's official entry into the 2009 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film. 1"
Nights in Rodanthe             ,jon.h.ochiai,1,drama,2008,7,"Richard Gere and Diane Lane are way better than the material in ""Nights in Rodanthe"". They almost justify sitting through this George C. Wolfe movie. Almost. I am a fan of Gere and Lane, and that is what attracted me to ""Nights in Rodanthe"". That's my story and I'm sticking by it. Ultimately, I liked the movie, but was also disappointed at the same time. ""Nights in Rodanthe"" does not have a compelling and cathartic Third Act. I did some homework before seeing the movie. The screenplay by Ann Peacock and John Ramano is based on the Nicholas Sparks novel. Not having read any of his novels, Sparks also wrote ""The Notebook"" and ""Message in a Bottle"". I had passed on seeing ""The Notebook"". However, I saw ""Message in a Bottle"". That is among my all time least favorite movies. Sparks possesses a singular thematic pattern which I don't particularly care for. So the fact that there is no distinguishing Third Act may be more Sparks' failing than Peacock and Ramano's.This is all the more disappointing. ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is perfectly cast with beautiful and compelling actors in Gere, Lane, and James Franco. Diane Lane is gorgeous. Richard Gere looks amazingly vibrant and fit. And casting James Franco as his estranged son Mark is a wonderful touch. Lane radiates both a strength and vulnerability in Adrienne Willis. Adrienne is coping with divorce from her cheating husband Jack (Chris Meloni), surviving as a single mom, and still mourning the loss of her father. Adrienne agrees to run a bed and breakfast inn in Rodanthe for her friend Jean (Viola Davis), while her kids Amanda (Mae Whitman) and Danny (Charlie Tahan) are vacationing with Jack in Florida. Jean is taking a holiday in the Islands. Gere plays Dr. Paul Flanner, a retired brilliant plastic surgeon from Raleigh, N.C. Paul comes to Rodanthe to complete a tragedy in his life. Paul stays for 4 nights at the Inn in Rodanthe. Scott Glenn is powerful in the pivotal role of Robert Torrelson, whom Paul must atone for his past arrogance and failings.It's a given that lost souls Adrienne and Paul will fall in love, and give each other the possibility of new life. This works because of the remarkable and captivating chemistry of Lane and Gere. Amidst the routine I got caught off guard when Lane and Gere are wondering through the attic-- Paul asks, ""Who keeps you safe?"" Lane admits that life often throws a curve saying, ""You become what you think you're supposed to be<U+0085>"" Lane evokes a touching sadness and regret. Gere elicits a humane and endearing compassion. James Franco is great as Paul's son Mark. Franco has a heart wrenching scene with Lane, where he tells Adrienne, ""Thank you for giving me back my father."" There is a touching and understated scene where Gere has his arm around Lane as they walk on the beach following a story arc. Paul says, ""I'm glad you were here<U+0085>"" Again Gere and Lane transcend the material. It unfortunate that much of this screen magic is wasted as director Wolfe concludes his story. ""Nights in Rodanthe"" deserves better and a resounding and complete resolution, even though I'm guessing that the movie is loyal to the Sparks novel. Gere, Lane, and we the audience deserve a complete and satisfying movie"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,kinderbrause,0,action,2008,1,"I love the Indy Trilogy, watched it a dozen times and couldn't wait for this one. I tried not to be spoiled, didn't read the reviews or watched the trailers, so that I would be able to form my own opinion on this movie. I even tried not to expect too much. The only expectation I had, was that it had to be less disappointing than Episode 1. But my disappointment concerning movies hit a new low. I really really tried to like it, but they made it impossible to. I thought setting the new movie into the 50s was actually a good idea. I could relate to Nevada, Area 51, even the Roswell aliens. I could even overlook Indy surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge - ridiculous as it was.But why was it not possible to let Indy search for a Crystal Skull, that may or may not be of alien nature, being chased by the Russians, only to find it at the end of the movie and the Skull being destroyed or locked away in Area 51? That would have been a plot in the sense of the first movies. But my wildest imaginations couldn't prepare me for Aliens and flying saucers in a Indy movie. That's as if God had appeared and congratulated Indy for finding his lost Ark at the end of Raiders.But it wasn't only the ridiculous plot. I remember reading an Interview where Spielberg and Lucas stated they tried to work with stunt teams and would only use CGI if there wasn't any other way. But that doesn't justify computer animated gophers, that you expect to start talking any minute or Ted-look-alike monkeys. Or a car chase that would have made the Wachowski brothers proud. The set of the Maya City with the fading stairs seemed like the leftovers of ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" and the ants like a cheap rip off from ""The Mummy"".Humour was created through nostalgic in-jokes but it lacked the original wit that excelled the first three parts. Unbearable over-the-top CGI action sequences were extended to a length that there wasn't any time left to pay tribute to the characters, their relationships or even dialog lasting longer than three sentences.And did I really need to know that Indy is actually the father of Tarzan? That he is not only a Doctor/Professor and an adventurer but a Colonel, an agent and a Double-Agent as well? That Marian has grown so tough that she borders on insanity with her hysterical laughter whenever danger is ahead?It's just a loud CGI-action movie without the heart and soul from the former Indy movies. Even a sense of adventure is missing.But at least Indy seems to have retired. Lets just hope that Lucas and Spielberg wont reunite again for Henry Jones Junior III  the new Trilogy. Because after Indy 4 I do believe that they can hit new lows with every new movie they come up with. 1"
Untraceable             ,raypdaley182,1,crime,2008,5,"I'll start by saying the idea for this film isn't an original one. Yes, it was done in Millennium. It was done in a Uk show MANY years before Millennium ever thought of it though. And I'm sure I've seen another movie (British Indy made) do this subject as well.Basically we've got a psycho killer using the internet to kill people. You've got a female FBI agent working in computer crimes whose stupid enough to be running a wireless network at home and doesn't seem to have educated her daughter towards downloads, Trojans, spyware or anything else.You'd think she'd at least have all remote access features turned off on her home machine? You'd also think at 8 years old her daughter would have taught not to leave the house in her pyjamas, especially if it appears someones filming the house live from the outside.Clearly the very stupid apple doesn't fall very far from the extremely stupid tree.Her partner getting caught and killed is pretty dire to be honest. How did the killer even get a sample of the girlfriends voice? The partner had only met her once.To be honest the killers actual motive for killing the 2 people related to his dad is an extremely tenuous and weak link at best. He has NO motive to kill the FBI guy at all. He knows it's going to lead to his eventual capture.The Female FBI agent is a truly stupid idiot with no brain, having called in for help, she's told a police car is coming then she returns to her hijacked car and is captured (obviously). The trouble there is once the killer takes her car they can track it anywhere using the Onstar system that's built into it (whether he'd hacked it or not they could still trace the car - a fact they seemed to overlook).The ""he disabled the car computer"" line, that's an incredibly huge cop-out on the writers part there. The fact that the killer is stupid enough to have parked under the bridge where the police can see him is an even huger cop-out. By now the writer is admitting ""I haven't got any ideas so I'm going to spoon feed you the ending no matter how awful it is"".The idea he took her to her own house to kill her is a super weak idea and obviously she was going to escape. Why he was talking about poisoning her then started feeding her into a shredder?Very weak ending to a generally awful film that wasn't even an original idea or original genre. Done miles better in things like Saw or Cube"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,husa22,1,drama,2009,5,"This movie was disappointing. I had just finished reading the book (which was excellent!) when I watched the movie, so I had very high hopes and expectations. Unfortunately, the movie was just not true enough to the spirit of the book to do it justice. First, there was not enough time spent on character development to make you really care about Lily's well-being, or the tension between Lily & June, or to truly despise T Ray and his evilness. August is not portrayed as being as wise as she seems to be in the book, and I don't think that it was from a lack of acting ability by Queen Latifah. I understand that Hollywood sometimes feels it has to cut out or combine characters from a book to make a movie ""work"", but by minimizing the role of the Daughters in the movie and their impact on Lily, we lost a large portion of the idea of ""sisterhood"" and ""family"" not only applying to blood relatives. Other things from the book were included without seeming necessary. Why bother mentioning Jack Palance and the ""colored woman"" who are expected in town? That information ultimately has no bearing in the scene where Zack is arrested, although it is the motivation for the white men and black boys being in town (outside the theater) in the book. The final scene where Lily asks her father about her mother is also disappointing and has been ""Hollywood-ized"". In the book, Lily did not ask if her mother had come back for her--she already knows that her mother was coming back for her the day that her mother died. What Lily asks T Ray is if she was actually the one who killed her mother, since she has always been unsure whether or not T Ray was telling her the truth. It may seem like a minor difference, but Lily has spent 10 years searching for the truth and questioning whether she is to blame for her mother's death--not wondering if her mother loved her enough to come back for her. As a last note I will just say that if you enjoyed the movie, please read the book--it is SO much better"
Prom Night             ,SJinSeaTac,1,horror,2008,1,"Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that NOBODY ever ""really"" gets killed (at least not on screen) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time.Honestly, I have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously.But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again! It is one thing to rent a ""bad"" movie at blockbuster from the Weinsteins, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-imagining. It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be ""funny"" like others on IMDb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring.Here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having some sexual affair with J.S. Cardone of ""The Forsaken"" to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste you're money like I did. The ""original"" sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what I say). 1"
Surveillance             ,schtigh,1,crime,2008,1,"After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy ""Chainsaw massacre""-feeling, everything falls apart.SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these ""fooled-ya""-movies can figure this out.This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people?

The Square             ,tigerfish50,0,crime,2010,8,"""The Square"" opens with two parked cars at a scenic overlook. In one of them, two agitated dogs observe the other vehicle where their respective owners, Ray and Carla, are engaging in some steamy extra-marital gymnastics. When Carla returns home from her tryst, she spots her rough diamond husband surreptitiously hiding a bag of cash in the ceiling of their washroom, whereupon she conceives the idea to steal the money and run off with her paramour to begin a new life together. Construction site manager Ray declines to go along with her scheme at first, anticipating a boatload of trouble fouling up his sweet kickback scam at work, but Carla's alluring charms soon prove too strong a temptation. The lovers hire themselves a dubious partner, lash together a leaky plan and set it in motion, only to meet with a firestorm of foul-ups, suspicion and terror.""The Square"" shares many themes and motifs with ""Body Heat"" and ""Blood Simple"". The chief differences are its gritty realism and fast pacing - and it also boasts an extensive cast of support roles that provide a bewildering array of possibilities for misunderstandings and betrayal among the various conspirators, victims and bystanders as their lives spiral out of control. By the time the dust has cleared at the conclusion, one begins to wonder if the phrase 'ratcheting up the tension' might not have been coined for this film. Nash Edgerton directs his brother Joel's tight script with verve, and extracts intense and believable performances from his actors. It all adds up to an impressive modern Indie film noir."
35 Shots of Rum             ,howard.schumann,0,drama,2009,NA,"In French director Claire Denis' 35 Shots of Rum, the world becomes, in author Sharon Salzberg's phrase, ""transparent and illuminated, as though lit from within"". It is a film of infinite tenderness in which the characters lives are delicately interwoven to build a tapestry of interconnectedness that signals life's inevitable passages. Reminiscent of Hou Hsiao-hsien's Café Lumiére with its intimate depiction of city life and the coming and going of trains, 35 Shots of Rum pays homage to Yasujiro Ozu in its story of the relationship between Lionel (Alex Descas), a train conductor of African descent whose striking features convey a sense of stoic dignity and his student daughter Josephine (Mati Diop) who is eager to assert her independence.Like the relationship of Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara in Ozu's films, the focus is on the mundane occurrences of everyday life, the quiet intimacies in which meaning is revealed only by implication. While the characters are black, their lives are comfortably middle class and the only suggestion of racial issues is a classroom scene where Jo talks about how ""the global South"" is indebted to the industrial north. Set to a lovely score by the British band ""Tindersticks"" and gloriously choreographed by cinematographer Agnes Godard, the film opens with a ten minute montage of the crisscrossing of trains of the RER, the system that connects Paris to its suburbs.Interspersed are close-up shots of Josephine, Lionel, and his co-worker René (Julieth Mars Toussaint) whose immanent retirement signals a depressing change in his life. As the scene shifts to a small Paris apartment, like a married couple, Lionel and Josephine settle into a domestic routine of cooking, cleaning, and showering, their relationship of father and daughter not made clear until we see a photograph of a younger Jo and her German mother. This initial opaqueness seems to pervade a film that relies on the viewer to fill in the blanks. It is clear from the outset, however, that Lionel is dependent on his daughter and fears her eventual departure.Although he tells her reassuringly, ""Don't feel I need to be looked after<U+0085>Just feel free"", he also lets her know her that ""We have everything here. Why go looking elsewhere?"" His happiness is threatened by upstairs neighbor Noé (Gregoire Colin), a scruffy-looking young man who lives with his cat and does not hide his feelings for Jo even while vowing to move to Gabon for a job. We are also introduced to Gabrielle (Nicole Dogué), a taxi driver who is attached to Lionel and may have been his lover. This unlikely quartet form an extended family and their deep seated feelings for each other are revealed in an illuminating scene in a café after their car breaks down in route to a concert.Lionel's conflicted feelings about his daughter's growing up become apparent when the intimate dance between father and daughter to the song ""Night Shift"" by the Commodores is interrupted by Noé who cuts in and immediately ups the romantic ante. Lionel's jealousy is also reflected by Gabrielle shortly afterwards as she watches Lionel dancing with the café's attractive hostess. In an unexpected trip to Germany to visit a friend (or sister) of Jo's late mother's, the inner lives of the characters and the bonds that hold them together are further explored, although little happens on the surface.To say that 35 Shots of Rum is a film of mystery belies the fact that it is also quite accessible though in a very rich and subtle way. Its achievement lies in its ability to create memorable characters and fully involve us in their lives without relying on extended conflict, outward displays of emotion, or even a coherent narrative, drawing its power from its creation of magic through silences, glances, and a loving warmth that lingers in the memory. It is one of Denis' best films."
WALL·E             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,animation,2008,10,"I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.WALL·E is a robot that is left all alone on Planet Earth, Earth is now covered with garbage. The humans have left onto a corporate ship and are living their lives care free and well, thought free. WALL·E has been collecting little human pieces here and there and making them into his treasures, but the one thing he really wants is a friend. One day a ship lands with a female robot, Eve, who WALL·E just adores, but Eve is on a mission to find a plant to bring back onto the human ship to show that Earth is safe. But when the ship grabs Eve, WALL·E follows her and discovers the mutiny that is afoot on the ship. Everyone is overweight, can't walk, can't think for themselves, and let's all the robots do all the work for them. But WALL·E and Eve are on the mission to get them back to Earth and give it a little love.WALL·E is seriously the best movie I have seen this summer, I just adored this movie, it has great laughs, cute jokes and is entertaining for the whole family. Like I said before, when it's Disney/Pixar you just can't go wrong. WALL·E is one of their most lovable characters ever and was like the robot version of Charlie Chaplin, he brought great slap stick to the story. This movie delivers everything you can imagine and much more, not to mention a great message. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it's just a very wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy. The animation, I can't believe how far we've come, but this was a beautifully made movie and couldn't have been better. I loved WALL·E, this is a movie that will bring you plenty of laughs for your summer.10/10 2"
Flash of Genius             ,dfranzen70,0,misc,2008,6,"Flash of Genius is the true story of the man who invented the intermittent wiper blade - only to see the Ford Mother company swipe the invention for their own benefit. But of course, this being a Hollywood film, the little guy fights back against the big, mean corporation, losing his family, wife, and sanity in the process.Bob Kearns (Greg Kinnear) is an engineering professor who comes up with the idea of the intermittent blade while driving his family - wife and six kids - home from church one rainy afternoon. He puts together a prototype and shops it to Ford, which quickly warms to the idea. Then suddenly changes its mind, saying its just not ready. And then double-plus suddenly, there are all these Ford cars on the road with those very same wiper blades. This is probably not a coincidence.What follows is your standard David/Goliath courtroom drama, without the courtroom (save for the finale). Bob fights back against Ford, but no one, not even high-powered attorney Alan Alda, really wants to help. Worse still, Bob doesnt even want a cash settlement, he wants an apology from Ford, an acknowledgment that they stole his awesome idea. This might surprise you, but they decline to do so.On the one hand, this is a straightforward story about the little buy fighting back against all odds, taking on the big automakers at a time when the Big Three reigned supreme. After all, Ford has all the time in the world to devote to defending itself against Kearns claims, whereas Bob has to scrimp and hope he can make some headway; they can outlast him as surely as a rock can outlast a summer storm. They have resources, and all he has is his devoted family.Well, not so much. Devoted to a point, perhaps. The strain of the legal battles soon take their toll on Bob and his wife, Phyllis (Lauren Graham), as well as the various kids. Which brings us to the second, even more important, conflict in this story, that between Bob and Everyone Who Means Something To Him.This is an innocuous, slight movie; it doesnt grab you so much as kind of pull you along reluctantly, until the final, courtroom scene. The rule for courtroom dramas seems to be this: If the protagonist has been built up sufficiently but the audience does NOT tear up when the inevitable verdict is read, then the movie is a failure. I mean, its really not complicated. If theres no payoff, then everything leading up to that point has been for naught, so everyone involved has to pull off that final scene. The nice thing is that pulling off that scene, otherwise known as manipulating the audience, is pretty elementary, high-school stuff. Its tough to mess it up.And they dont. True to form, that final scene makes up for all the methodical pacing of the other 90 minutes or so. Kinnears earnest and well cast, and Graham is a delight as his doting, no-nonsense wife. Aldas showy role doesnt really amount to much at all, contrary to what the trailer showed. But all in all, its a well done, if somewhat forgettable, movie."
Pathology             ,mickeyshamrock,1,crime,2008,7,"Hi friends - I'm going to be honest here, PATHOLOGY really impressed and surprised me. On the surface PATHOLOGY seems like a fun, silly, popcorn movie (from the writers of CRANK) in the vein of FLATLINERS or ANATOMY <U+0096> however, excellent direction, great photography, and solid performances really elevate this little horror/thriller and make it so much better than I (and I'm assume you) could expect. It's a shame that MGM hung this movie out to dry in the theaters but I'm guessing it's because they didn't know how to market it. You see: PATHOLOGY is kind of immoral, mean spirited, filled with sex, and features some great medical based gore <U+0096> my (and I'm assuming your) kind of movie <U+0096> but certainly not an easy sell. I guess at it's core PATHOLOGY is a fun, silly, popcorn movie but it's executed so well that it rises above the rest of the trash in the theater right now (4.20.08). So check this movie out <U+0096> I think you (and you) will like it."
Trucker             ,jaybob,1,drama,2010,NA,"James Mottern wrote & directed,It is first theatrical effort.I feel he will be a force to be reckoned with over the next few decades.This is a drama of the first order,It is not a happy film.It is a simple story of sad lonely people. None of them are where they want to be. Due to the cleverness of the writer & the superb acting by a non big-name cast, we go along with it and are drawn into what is occurring.Michelle Monagham's performance is an award winning one. This is not a big studio release so thusly it has no big 'PUSH' for any awards.Eleven year old Jimmy Bennett is excellent as her son. Nathan Fillon (TV featured performer)is her caring neighbor. Benjamin Bratt as her ex husband & the lads father is equally great.The cinematography & song score are also first rate.THis is an art house low budget movie so as expected it did not have a decent theatrical release.I highly recommend this drama for all those who appreciate real good film.There is some violence towards the end,BUT this important & not just put in the film.Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97 points (out of 10) IMDb 10 (out of 1"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,jotix100,1,drama,2010,7,"We are taken to rural South Carolina where T. Ray Owens (don't you like those Southern names?) and his wife Deborah, are fighting, while their four year old daughter, Lily, is watching her father beat up his wife. The reason appears to be connected with the fact she wants out of a bad marriage. During the struggle there a shot is fired, killing Deborah.Years have gone by, Lily is a teenager when we meet her again. T. Ray is has kept his mean attitude, not only toward his daughter, but toward Rosaleen, their live-in maid, as well. The time of the action is the 1960s when blacks saw a ray of hope by the laws that would allow them to become first class citizens, something that up to this point, had been denied to them. Rosaleen feels she must register to vote. Unfortunately, she is assaulted by some white folks that beat her up. Lily, who has had it with the situation at home, rescues Rosaleen and both flee to a town called Tiburon, a place that is engraved in Lily's mind.Lily and Rosaleen are directed to the house of three black sisters that make a living out of the bees they tend to. The sisters have peculiar names. There is May, who appears to be mentally challenged. June is a young woman that evidently has received a formal education. The eldest sister is August, a proud lady, who takes pity on the new arrivals. August takes Lily under her wing, introducing her to the art of keeping the bees that provide them with a comfortable living. The honey produce is much appreciated all around.Unfortunately, it is still the South. Tiburon has its share of bigots. Lily, who has connected with the kind Zach, accompanies him to town to catch a film. The theater was still segregated. When Lily sneaks out to the balcony, a group of white men pulls Zach away, beating him mercilessly, and taking him away. May, is distraught upon hearing the sad news. Eventually, Zach is brought home, but May is not there to greet him.When T. Ray finds Lily, he wants to take her back with him. She, on the other hand, does not want to have anything with a father she does not love. Lily has found a heaven with the kind sisters that take her in without asking anything. At the end Lily finds out the truth about her mother and the connection with the sisters.Gina Prince-Bythewood adapted and directed Sue Monk Kidd's beloved novel of the same title. To her credit, she has stayed away from the sentimentality that could have easy been the wrong approach to bringing the story to a cinematic form. The Boatwright women are depicted in vivid detail as each one deals with the newly arrival of Lily into their midst. The era of the bigotry in that part of the country takes second seat to the relationship between the Boatwrights and Lily.Queen Latifah's August shows a regal lady that is too wise as well as nurturing. Dakota Fanning, now a teenager herself, works effortlessly with Lily, something that appears to come naturally to her. We especially liked Sophie Okonedo, a sensational actress, that moves the viewer with her take of May. Paul Bettany is seen briefly as T. Ray. Alicia Keys plays Jun"
Saw V             ,Otoboke,0,crime,2008,NA,"In what is only the fifth film of the Saw series released over its five year Halloween run at the box office, this latest installation suffers from the same detrimental qualities that made number four slightly disappointing for fans and casual audiences alike. Making his directorial debut here, all eyes are cast upon David Hackl to see if he can either bring something new, or at least keep the momentum going for the popular franchise. The good news for some is that Saw V feels natural and consistent to its recent predecessors helmed by Bousman, yet for many others this won't be something to get excited about. Insofar as the movie itself goes; this is mostly typical Saw material throughout, going through the motions almost. This of course will please those looking for a continuation of the previous instalments, but it will undoubtedly feel too stagnant and jaded to interest anyone else. Nevertheless, for his first feature film at the reins, Hackl proves he can live up to Bousman's style that has been engrained in the series thus far, creating yet another engaging and loyal sequel that will be sure to cater to those craving more twisted games.For many fans and casual watchers of the series, Saw figuratively died when lead character and focus for the film Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) eventually succumbed to his cancer in film number three. Yet just as instalment IV managed to incorporate the mastermind into its story, as does V in the same manner; through flashbacks. Playing a game of two sides and narratives that eventually collide, Saw V first and foremost continues on where we left from IV, detailing the continuation of Jigsaw's work through forensics expert Hoffman and how he eventually has to tie up all loose ends regarding the deaths of those in III and IV. This narrative, although a little tiresome in its approach of filling in every detail and hole in previous features, nevertheless provides as the real meat of the script. Characters are again rather shallow, and motives are less than clear, yet much of this goes out the window when Mr. Bell graces the screen with his presence. As he has proved time and time again, it is within the character of Jigsaw that Saw's real heart lays, and with plenty of reminiscing going on here in regards to numbers I-IV, there's enough material and characterisation work here to satisfy hardcore fans of the series.On the other side of the pitch however is a much less character/dialogue driven narrative which focuses solely on another unlucky five as they work their way through the latest of Jigsaws traps, this time set up by successor Hoffman. For those who attend screenings of the latest Saw movies only to watch people get their comeuppance through a series of bloody and grisly tests, then this will be where your thirst is quenched. Taking on a tone that is strikingly similar to instalment two, the challenges presented here are graphic and extremely cerebral, shot in the same berserk ways so far explored in the series (although, the blending scene segment style incorporated in IV is gone) which add to the movie's intense ability to draw you in.A consistently forceful element of the series, cinematographer David A. Armstrong here follows the movie's mantra of ""don't fix what isn't broke"", and the film's sense of coherency and embodiment of the script's themes works just as well here as it did in previous features. Sure enough, Saw wouldn't be Saw without its morally challenging undercurrent squirming underneath all the corpses and violence, and in this regard V does well to incorporate the same subtext. Of course as has been the case with all the sequels thus far, the message isn't quite as clear here as it was in the original, and the ideas always seem to be justifying the gore rather than the other -more appropriate- way around, but there's enough here to stop the whole ordeal boiling down to a silly slasher flick with no fibre to it at all.Needless to say there are many audiences out there who outwardly oppose everything the Saw series stands for, be it involving the gore, the message, or just the tacky horror-movie-sequel feel in general. Yet as I have been witness to many the genre has to offer so far this year I can safely say that while Saw V is by no means a masterpiece nor as significant as its first production, it still beats out most of the competition by quite some distance.In the end, the entire ordeal feels more like an add-on; a tid-bit of flavour designed to tie up the loose ends left dangling from all the other features, and in this respect V will feel a little underwhelming; even to rabid fans of the series. And yet, it's the fans that will make up most of Saw V's audience. I recommend V, but only to fans, and only because there's hope that VI (which the door is left wide open to here) might get the ball rolling again and begin to tell a new story. So by all means, if you can appreciate the series' unmatched ability to make you squirm, to have you question your moral code, and to fascinate you with its lurid, engrossing world made of cogs, puzzle pieces and of course, saws, then you can't go wrong here. Saw V is everything that fans of the series as a whole will want, but a lack of progression in narrative and its disregard for relevancy to anyone outside of its core audience inevitably cuts it short; not enough for anyone else, but fans should enjoy it for the most part.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net) "
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,paul2001sw-1,0,misc,2011,NA,"Giulio Andreotti can be seen as both the precursor to, and the antithesis of, Silvio Belusconi: an Italian politician with his fingers on every lever that led to power, accused of everything but convicted of nothing, and yet peculiarly devoid of conventional charisma. A sense of a particularity, of a man who had become nothing beyond a carefully constructed defence of his own behaviour, was nicely captured in Tim Parks' fictional work 'Destiny'; and we get the same feeling in 'Il Divo', a biopic with an extraordinary performance Toni Sevillo by in the lead role. What neither offer is definitive, or even speculative, resolution of the enigma and his actions; just a chilling yet plausible portrait of the man. Yet without providing clear answers, something else must provide the story. In Parks' book, Andreotti was a bit part; in the film, there's no other narrative, and sometimes the direction feels a little too heavy, overdone perhaps because there isn't a smooth tale holding things together. And the music on the soundtrack seems deliberately incongruous, thrown into the mix to provide some variation in tone that would otherwise have been lacking. But Servillo's performance more than compensates; it will lead you wanting the same answers, one suspects, that everyone has wanted from Andreotti for a long long tim"
College Road Trip             ,klucas89,1,adventure,2008,9,I've read all of the other reviews and i believe in order to enjoy the movie it has to be for the right audience. I'm sorry for those of you who watched it and were disappointed because your idea of a college roadtrip is girls and booze. I'm about to go to college this fall and it hit so close to home. This was a great movie and me and my mom were both laughing. I was quite surprised that a Disney movie could have so much meaning for those of us who are in that part of life while also providing a clean movie for the entire family. If the critics tell you it was bad and if that's what you base whether you will go see the movie or not then don't go! You don't have to write horrible reviews so that others who may take something away from the movie may not go.
The Ruins             ,JoelHorton_1,,adventure,2008,1,"God! Where do I begin? From start to finish, I could not help to hate this movie. Vines? Vines that make cell-phone noises?! Oh yeah, I'm so scared - I'm going to rid the weeds of earth! Come on people! The plot went nowhere, When the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! That whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), sawing off Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots first threw down the rope after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground. I cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie, there is just too much to cover. I will say the graphics as far as the gore were terrific, but it amounted to nothing since the acting and script were so terrifically bad."
Slumdog Millionaire             ,Movie_Muse_Reviews,0,drama,2008,9,"It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later,"" ""Sunshine"") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.While the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. ""Slumdog"" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.It's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/ 1"
Milk             ,heffay111,0,misc,2008,7,"First of all, I recommend that people see this movie. I am a straight, married man, and I would recommend it to anyone. I am extremely happy that this movie was made. I was a child when these events took place, and I was fairly ignorant about Harvey Milk, knowing of his activism but not much about it.Harvey Milk was simply an amazing human being, and his story is moving, dramatic, important and inspiring. Yet there was something about this movie, be it the pacing or something else, that made it less than the sum of its parts. And the parts were all great.I have to say that the performances are fantastic. Everyone will likely scream for Sean Penn to get an Oscar nomination, but I think that James Franco gave a performance that was equally fantastic. I hope that he gets the recognition that he deserves. In fact, he grounded the film and gave the story a balance, a home. And all of the supporting characters are engaging and well performed.And the sets, costumes and production design, capturing the 70's with engaging perfection, added a true sense of place to the movie.So I was left asking, as I walked onto the street, ""How do you take a great man, a great story, great performances, and great production design, and make a movie that is good? Not great. Not amazing. Good."" Tellingly, the most emotionally charged moment, the moment when the audience cheers the most, proves that movie did not live up to its subject.See it. Even if, like me, you wish the movie itself was better, you will be glad that you saw this film."
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,artisticengineer,,adventure,2010,NA,"This movie came so close to being a very good movie but fouled up at the end-leaving one to mourn what would have been a very good adaptation of a very good book.It is the summer of 1983. A college graduate (Art) is trying to enjoy his last summer before he leaves Pittsburgh (his home) to become a financial broker. We find that his dad (fantastic portrayal by Nick Nolte) is an organized crime chief, of the local mob, and is proud of his son graduating and does NOT want his son to go into organized crime. The son takes a job for the summer at a local bookstore and is immediately seduced by his only slightly older female supervisor; an affair ensues. During this same period of time Art meets a stunningly attractive young blond (portrayed by Sienna Miller) who likes him; even though she already has a boyfriend (dude named Cleveland). The next day Cleveland, a tough biker type, comes to the bookstore and gives Art a deal ""he cannot refuse""- which is a ride on the bike to a local abandoned factory site. At the factory site is a smokestack that still belches out clouds; even though the factory has been shut down for thirty years! Why? It is a mystery, a mystery of Pittsburgh. Why is does Cleveland turn to be actually friendly towards a potential rival? Well, that is another mystery of Pittsburgh.The movie portrays the last summer of youthful abandon and care; set in surprisingly beautiful settings of a city that is reinventing itself from the traditional ""smokestack technology"" to a more ""greener"" environment. Yet, the problem with the movie is its unrealistic portrayal of male and female friendships. It was a very good movie; showing Sienna Miller, for example, doing some very good driving of golf balls at a party. Yet, this subplot never plays out- never explains why she is shown doing something so atypical. Loose ends, poor connections, double meanings that invoke something that is hard to believe even with the typical ""suspension of disbelief"" found at movies. All of these plot error and loopholes foul up the movie beyond redemption"
Julia             ,zetes,1,crime,2010,6,"Awkward kidnapping thriller/actress vehicle for Tilda Swinton. I love Swinton as much as the next movie lover, and for a while I was thinking that, yes, this was her shining moment. But after a while, it all seemed like a little too much. She's done a ton of subtle work over the past two decades, and she's so in your face here it just doesn't feel like the same actress. That could be a compliment, but I found her work here so overwrought. One of the problems is that a lot of the dialogue is improvised (I'm guessing), and I don't think she acquitted herself well. The plot involves a hopeless alcoholic who gets involved in a kidnapping plot. The woman who asks her to help (Kate del Castillo, just awful) is also an alcoholic. Her son was taken from her by her dead husband's father. She claims to have money to pay Swinton in Mexico. Swinton sees it as the perfect opportunity for a double cross. Later, there'll be more double crosses, probably a triple cross, and eventually the kid gets kidnapped FROM Swinton by some Mexican gangsters. It's all very meandering, and the film runs a whopping two and a half hours (at 90 minutes, it could have been very good). It's not that it's a boring film, really, it's just kind of annoying and unfocused."
Nim's Island             ,ccthemovieman-1,1,adventure,2008,7,"Silly? Yes. Predictable? Yes. For Kids? Yes. Entertaining? Yes.....even for adults, IF you don't take anything seriously and expect something a little dumb but charming.nonetheless. Picture yourself as a kid watching a movie and you'll enjoy it a lot more, because it's definitely a children's film. It also has an involving story. Once it starts you have to stick around and see how it winds up. With some movies, I could care less but this one, I cared.For those who have kids age 5-12, this is highly recommended. For adults, well, it's not bad. If you're looking for ""clean"" entertainment, you found it. It's not goody-goody, either, and it's not always a smart family movie (a father leaving his kid all alone for several days?) but it's a nice movie, has funny animal characters, a lead kid who is not a brat, nice island scenery, one big-name actress (Jodie Foster) and is a diversion for an hour-and-a-half.The little dragon ""Fred"" is the best of the non-humans. I don't know if that's the real noise that lizard makes, but it's fun to hear. Seals are always entertaining, too. The one in this film is very talented. As for the humans, Abigail Breslin as ""Nim Rusoe"" is a cute, likable kid. Gerard Butler plays both male leads and does them well enough that you forget he's doing two characters. Seeing Foster do slapstick while being a female ""Mr. Monk"" was a little odd but, I'm not going to knock her for trying.As another reviewer said here, put yourself in a little kid's shoes and enjoy the film."
Street Kings             ,ivo-cobra8,,misc,2015,10,"Street Kings (2008) is one of the best cop action thrillers from Keanu Reeves. This movie was released in 11 April 2008 (USA) after hearing about this movie that Keanu Reeves made another action movie I rushed to see it right away, if it is any good and I was right! It is a good action thriller! It is one of my favorite best Keanu Reeves movies, I am still a big fan of him and I always enjoy this movie. I also had no idea that Chris Evans (Captain America The Winter Soldier, Avengers) started in this movie as the main support cast opposite of Keanu Reeves. Chris acted outstanding in here as Detective Paul Diskant. This is a slick perfect action thriller about dirty cops and a cop been killed, while other cop is blamed and framed for his death, by other follow officers, now he has to clear his name and punished the guilty ones and finding a Justice on his own way! I know a lot of people don't like this movie that is fine, but is 1.000.000 times way better to seeing this flick than watching the new Keanu Reeves movie Knock Knock! The mystery, the acting and the action in this movie is outstanding!""Street Kings"" is possibly one of the best cop thrillers in years since the likes of The Departed, Training Day, Dark Blue, and To Live and Die in L.A.! Keanu Reeves gives a very strong performance as a veteran L.A. detective who is struggling with his conscience as he deals with both delivering brutal street justice and mourning the death of his wife. Oscar winner Forest Whitaker gives another strong performance as Keanu's hard-nosed boss, whose duties include keeping Keanu within the confines of the law and out of the clutches of Internal Affairs. Hugh Laurie (TV's ""House"") was a real surprise in the movie, as he plays the captain of Internal Affairs who is out to bring down corruption in the force, particularly amongst the Vice Squad (which includes Keanu, Whitaker, and a couple of appearances by Jay Mohr and John Corbett). And Chris Evans (""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") gives a very convincing performance as a young detective who teams up with Keanu after evidence implicates the latter in the death of his ex-partner.This movie is filed with a lot of action and twists, although some were predictable it kept me interested to the end. Keanu Reeves played a good part along with Forest Whitaker who always gives a top notch performance. It is a fun flick, specially if you are Keanu Reeves fan or you like the actor. This movie was pretty good. I enjoyed it very much. great cast. good story. I know this type of Bad cop movie has been done before in different ways. Keanu Reeves did a way better job as a cop in Street Kings then he did an architect in Knock Knock. Very believable. Great camera and make-up work. there was a good part in this movie were you can feel how cold the streets could be. But for the most part it was very predictable. In this movie are two rappers in here that both plays different characters and they did a good job on acting. Even some people would not agree with me. Common as corrupt LAPD deputy masquerading as ""Coates"" and The Game as Grill. I think both did a good job playing their roles. Street Kings got a also a sequel which it sucked ass! Both of the roles Keanu Reeves passed in the sequels Speed and Street Kings. Because he knew it was a bad idea and the sequels will be a failure and they really were.Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a veteran LAPD cop who finds life difficult to navigate after the death of his wife. When evidence implicates him in the execution of a fellow officer, he is forced to go up against the cop culture he's been a part of his entire life. This is Keanu Reeves that I love and not his role in Knock Knock, this movie kicks ass!!!!!! And I don't care if you put down this review I stand by my morals of a Keanu Reeves fan boy and I love an action films that he made! I am giving this movie 10/10 it is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves best action thriller."
Mamma Mia!             ,RocketB52,1,comedy,2008,2,"Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut to the chase.Forced frivolity. Miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep gives it a great try. Pierce Brosnan just plain embarrassing. Inexplicably set on a Greek Island. Lots of squealing, shrieking women. Lots.It was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight? Ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have GREAT night out on the town? That's the feeling of this whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped. "
Shutter             ,hisdefectivesoul,0,horror,2008,3,"*Spoiler Warning*So my friend and I went to go see this movie on opening night, and we were HIGHLY disappointed by the end of it.Pretty much, it was as if someone mixed most of The Grudge and some of The Ring together, and added in a camera. PRESTO, a cheap horror movie ripoff!Here are a list of Parallels or Similarities between this movie and the Grudge and the Ring.Both - Person(s) who are dead, wanting revenge. Grudge - A man jumps off a balcony killing himself. Both - Hallucinations/Seeing Thingsie.Grudge - Ended with character in metal hospital, with the spirit nearby. (Grudge: Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, Shutter: Ben w/ Megumi on his shoulders.) Both - Female character investigates. Grudge - Occurs mainly in Japan Grudge - Person(s) that are dead, of Japanese origin. Ring - Bodies of the spirits found Ring - Occurrences don't stop after a ""proper funeral/burial"" had taken place as expectedAnyways, here's a quick rundown of the movie.Ben and Jane get married. Honeymoon cut short due to job opportunity in Tokyo, Japan. Both go there. While driving in a forested area, they run into a ""seemingly alive"" woman, literally. Car crashes, and both knocked unconscious. By the time they come to, the woman is missing, and they call the authorities but nothing turns up. From then on, all the photos Ben takes seem to have ""Spirits"" in them, which eventually mess up one of the photo shoots he was doing for his job. Also from that incident, they both start having hallucinations and rundowns with this ""spirit"". Eventually they both investigate together (after Jane herself has done by herself already) and find Megumi (the dead woman) dead in her house outside of Tokyo as a skeleton. Proper funeral occurs after a night where Ben and Jane both nearly die from her, and they expect everything to be fine; moving back to America. After that Jane discovers that her husband tortured Megumi in a way, and then Jane came to a conclusion that Megumi was trying to warn her about the kind of man he was, and leaves him. Ben then tries killing himself and ends up in a mental institution.If the story had a more original twist to it, it would have been a much better film. The suspense scenes were more comical then frightening (The spirit was randomly sitting down brushing her hair making a ""Grudge-ish"" sound, frightening Ben), and random women screaming didn't help the movie in any way.However, the acting in the movie was pretty good, so I can't fully hate the movie.Overall 3/10. I only suggest seeing it if you are trying desperately for a good laugh, or if you are completely bored into insanity."
Goodbye Solo             ,jdesando,0,drama,2009,NA,"""The basis of optimism is sheer terror."" Oscar WildeThe two improbable ""travelers"" in Patrice Leconte's Man on the Train seem like old men at a nursing home compared to the dynamic layers of regret and hope between Senegalese cab driver Solo (Souleymane Sy Savane) and grizzled old man William (Red West)in Goodbye Solo. Solo takes him on several rides in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, culminating in a life-changing one in the Smokey Mountains. This tense little drama of ordinary people has a distant relationship to Beckett and Pinter, whose dramas introduce unknown forces and people who change things, even if those elements don't appear. Iranian director/writer Ramin Bahrani, along with co-writer Bahareh Azimi, has neatly shown the quotidian events of Solo's life, from the joys of a loving step-daughter and new son to strain of trying to become a flight attendant. Upon the entrance of the troubled William into his life, Solo deals with his urge to help William overcome depression and disappointment and Solo's own existential uncertainties.Goodbye SOlo has large ambitions about showing the need to understand the end of life for the desperately disappointed and the beginning of a happy life for the positive, optimistic newcomers in the great melting pot. Solo remains hopeful in both arenas despite the forces allied against him, finding strength in his alliance with William just as characters in Beckett and Pinter find theirs.The coda is as impressive as any other this year: the top of one of the North Carolina hills is circumscribed by an eccentric wind that seems to blow up and back at the same time, figuratively signaling the end and beginning. Solo and step-daughter Alex take comfort in the danger of the wind and precipice adjoining the safety of each other.The message is clearlife goes on, sometimes dangerously, sometimes beautifully."
The Bank Job             ,claudio_carvalho,0,crime,2012,8,"In 1971, the criminal Michael X (Peter De Jersey) blackmails the British government with compromising photos of members of the parliament practicing kinky sex with prostitutes. He keeps the photos in a safe deposit box in the Lloyds Bank in the Baker Street.The ambitious MI-5 Federal Agent Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) plots a bold plan to retrieve the pictures using a heist of the bank. He arrests the former model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) in the airport trafficking drugs and offers security information to her to facilitate to rob of the bank.In return, he requests the content of the safe box no. 118 that belongs to Michael X.Martine goes to East London and meets her former lover, the car dealer Terry Leather (Jason Statham) that is married with two daughters but owes money to a dangerous loan shark, and tells him that the bank's alarm will be deactivated during a few days. Terry summons his friends and the team of amateurs succeeds in the heist. However, together with the money, the gang also steels the photos of Michael X; the book with the transactions with dirty cops of the Scotland Yard of the pornographer Lew Vogel (David Suchet); and photos of politicians in the Sonia Bern's brothel. Now different groups organize a manhunt to Terry and his friends with different objectives, where the stolen money is the less important. ""The Bank Job"" was the great surprise of this week, with a good story based on true events. I bought this Blu Ray a long time ago but my expectations were very low. However this film is one of the best movies of bank heist that I have ever seen. In the end, the thieves are the most charismatic characters among such corruptors and unethical people. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Efeito Dominó"" (""Domino Effect"""
Adoration             ,DMANJAM,0,drama,2010,5,"Atom Egoyan is a very skilled filmmaker that is exploiting a stereotype of the older white person's racism against a Lebanese son in law. Old white people are easy to pick on, Hollywood routinely allows this because there is little criticism generated from it. Does that mean this is right? I don't think so. The film implies that a group of people (older white people) are ""monsters."" Maybe Atom has experienced racism from white people because of his Egyptian father, I get the feeling that he hates me for being white and 54 years old.

Frygtelig lykkelig             ,elivbg1,0,crime,2010,NA,"This movie definitely has some intrigue in the beginning; a policeman is relocated to a small village because of a serious misdemeanor. There is an intriguing story in the background as he makes it into the village- a metaphoric story, which hints at the modus operandi of the village people. There is a missing person, an intriguing woman with an abusive husband, and several other characters that each has its own peculiar secret. So far, so good.I stopped watching the movie when the weakness of the characters and bad luck took over the movie plot-line or rather- was it the plot that took over the ""empty"" characters? The characters started feeling/looking like puppets in the hands of their bad luck. I lost connection with the characters at this point and that left me feeling like an outsider.At this point, I did not think that the movie would be intriguing but rather thought it is just trying to make a point for which the characters are only a vehicle. The message to me was that in the end weakness transcends all other values, that the social collective reinforces each person's individual weakness. True? Unfortunately, it is perhaps a brilliantly realistic point. Inspiring for a movie? Uplifting in any way? Not really. The movie had a point and made it"
WALL·E             ,jaredmobarak,0,animation,2008,8,"Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without saying<U+0097>better than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.I credit the filmmakers for showcasing a world that has been left unlivable due to pollution and excess, yet never stooping to the level of liberal propaganda to soapbox an environmental agenda. No, the idea of ""going green"" or ""stop global warming"" never comes out blatantly, but instead we are shown the message of how technology is making us gluttons and sloths, reliant for everything and unable to even see what is going on right in front of our faces. Humanity, drifting on a space station for 700 years being waited on hand and foot, has become a giant mass of inactive waste. Watching their awakening at the hands of a little waste removal machine, seeing love, life, and beauty as if for the first time ever is a wonderful thing. Sure the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey is fantastic, but these moments work on another level altogether<U+0097>that of truth. Consumer culture and materialism has destroyed our society to the point that social status depends on the car you drive and the trinkets you can collect rather than the job you do and the work you put in. To see the Captain of the vessel, housing what has become of the human race, slowly open his eyes to what could be is mind-blowingly simple, yet also so necessary for children these days to see what burying their heads in the computer and cell phone is doing to the societal structure of the world. We need to stop being lemmings, droning along without purpose. There is a reason for life, things to strive for and love is one of them, something very prevalent here.The robots themselves become more human than the humans, showing the emotion and compassion that people have left by the wayside. Curiosity takes center stage as Wall-E finds treasures amongst the trash he has been programmed to clean up for a return of life to Earth. Stacking his compacted boxes of refuse into skyscrapers taller than those left behind, he finds shelter in an abandoned tractor where he keeps spare parts and objects to play with during his solitude. Never expecting a visitor, or the impact that finding a small sapling of greenery could cause, a sophisticated robot named EVE arrives and changes his world forever. Not only does she become the woman of his dreams, but she also causes him to leave Earth and discover the spaceship, which has been trying to find his home for way too long.Maybe it is funny to say, but the chemistry between these two machines is quite palpable and real, as they discover feelings that they shouldn't have due to programming and such, but they have evolved into sentient creatures. They fight for freedom against the spaceship's auto-pilot and take a stand to end the tyranny that has been subtly and effectively beating the humans into submission. Of course they may not be doing it for the humans per se, there is a matter of needing to go back for spare parts, but you'll understand once you see. Sure the Captain does his part to see the hero that Wall-E becomes to his stagnant race and being voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin definitely helps. When he starts viewing the history of Earth and just exudes wonderment and joy, you really enjoy the ride as he attempts to reverse his sloth and actually stand on his two legs for possibly the first time ever.Where I do have a problem with the film is the pacing. Yes, I know there is very little dialogue<U+0097>and I whole-heartedly praise the film for it<U+0097>but the beginning does have a tendency to drag. Maybe some of that has to do with it being an extended version of the trailer, but it just gets a little tedious as we wait for EVE to arrive and end the cute monotony of Wall-E playing with his finds in ways they aren't supposed to be used for, we've seen it before in The Little Mermaid. Even once they are on the ship, the cat and mouse game gets a little prolonged to pad the runtime a bit. The story here isn't very complex and I just wish there had been more to it, or at least a bit faster paced of a plot progression. Otherwise, though, this is another solid film from Pixar, showing that they definitely have the creativity and storytelling ability to infuse heart back into cinema and try new things rather than regurgitate for a big paycheck.

Bedtime Stories             ,bluebot,0,adventure,2008,1,"Let me start off first by making an appeal to Adam Sandler: PLEASE STOP MAKING MOVIES!!! I will say that I give this movie an ""E"" for effort. And a very weak ""E"" at that. I could see where the filmmakers were ""trying"" to go with this but they simply FAILED. Adam Sandler gets more and more annoying with each of his latest attempts. I think that the last Adam Sandler movie I actually enjoyed and chuckled through was ""The Water Boy"", and that ain't saying much. This was a very, VERY lazy and weak attempt at family entertainment. Convincing proof that Hollyweird is completely out of refreshingly original or ""good"" ideas. This movie was simply bad, bad, bad. Even during the scenes that were supposed to be ""rawkishly funny"" and even ""cute"", this movie failed to deliver on all fronts. At best, this movie may play well on late night television while one is high on crack."
Pathology             ,asherz-3,1,crime,2008,7,"I went to see this movie without any prior expectations (I hadn't seen the trailer).After a slow start the plot progressed steadily and managed to hold my attention despite Milo Ventimiglia's ""smell the fart"" acting. The copious amounts of gore seem excessive in the beginning, but generally add to the overall ""shock factor"" of the movie. Along with some in your face, sometimes slightly disturbing, sex scenes, this film is definitely NOT FOR THE LIGHTHEARTED.Without giving too much away, this movie relies upon a classic mentor/apprentice rivalry. Despite being involved in sick extra curricular activities, main character Ted Grey manages to hold the viewer's empathy. The climatic ending of the film leaves you feeling satisfied yet a little sick in the stomach."
Space Chimps             ,literarycherub,,animation,2008,1,"""There's no intelligent life here."" Okay, so my brother and I have a tradition of seeing every animated film that comes to theaters; when we saw the previews for this movie, we thought it looked somewhat dumb but decent for some mindless entertainment nonetheless. I did not predict just how incredibly and irredeemably horrible this movie would be.I'm someone who usually can be fairly lenient regarding movies as long as they are entertaining somehow. But while this movie certainly entertained me, as it was actually hilarious just how stupidly- and lazily-done the whole thing was, I obviously can't give it points for being entertaining only in the form of inspiring derision and incredulity.Literally every single scene was a cringe-worthy one, laden with contrivance, predictability, and cliché. The whole story was as formulaic as one could get and pulled all the worn-out stops: the personality of the main character himself--who is pretty much a watered-down, unfunny, Kuzco wannabe; the unconvincing, charmless romance between two characters who supposedly clash at the start and fall in love through their shared adventure; the trite and forced internal conflict of the main character who tries to live up to his dead grandfather; the ridiculous and embarrassing villains; the attempts at sounding intelligent to fool the kids in the audience but failing to fool anyone older than maybe 10-years-old; and the triumphant--albeit completely uninspiring--end for the space chimps.I honestly can't imagine that anyone would truly connect with the emotion the movie tried to suck out of its lazy and flat conflicts nor laugh at the painfully unfunny jokes seen hundreds of times in films before it. The pacing and writing seemed to make both these tasks impossible.Every scene was so rushed that the characters and their dynamics with each other lacked any real development, and every attempt at making the audience feel what was going on in the moment (or even caring at all) was murdered by this fact. Obviously, I don't need to say much more about the writing quality than I already have; it was just lazy, lazy, lazy. I couldn't imagine anyone older than 12 writing this drivel, and it seemed as if the writers literally watched every animated film before this and wrote down only the most frequently-occurring, most unfunny gags from each of them, slapped it together, and called it ""Space Chimps"".There were only maybe three to five lines that made me genuinely chuckle, but that does not redeem the movie from getting the grade it so deserves: F. And I rarely give F's out to anything, but this is easily the worst animated film I've ever seen. Period."
The Objective             ,jessicaFTM87,,horror,2008,5,"I saw the Tribeca screening in NYC last week. I was entranced and enthralled, and found the first 2/3 of the movie to be excellent. But the end was a huge letdown for me. My boyfriend felt the same. There is no resolution. We had all sorts of questions that were left unanswered: were the ""bad guys"" ghosts? ETs? The CIA? Why was Keynes floating at the end? How did he get back to the West? Who were the people watching him through the glass? Yes, all sorts of strange, unearthly things were happening to the soldiers... but WHY -- and WHO was doing this to them? We never get a satisfactory answer as to WHO and WHY. This could have been a GREAT movie... if only things weren't left up in the air (like Keynes) at the end. The producers should re-think the ending with Myrick and re-shoot the end -- or audiences are going to stay away, in my opinion."
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,neftaliw,1,adventure,2008,6,"It would be harsh to judge this movie for it's factual errors because we know that it's intended to be a fantasy movie for kids. However, maybe the people from other countries doesn't look at this so bad as I did being from Mexico. All the geography in the movie is way wrong. First they go across the border by car and suddenly arrive to Los Cabos without transcurring a single day. Then Chloe gets kidnapped and taken to Mexico City by car (note that somehow they leaped over the ocean) and arrive also in less than one day. After that they go to Puerto Vallarta, where they take a train to Tijuana (note that there are no train stations in Tijuana) and somehow they arrive to Chihuaha (If you see a map you'd know that Chihuahua is in the opposite direction) where they find a chihuahua's civilization (also note that the principal chihuahua Moctezuma is not a chihuahua) where they are descendants of the Aztec people (there were no Aztecs up in Chihuahua). Note that the bad dog traced them all over those places and also did the inspector. Man I would love to get the white car they used!!! they traveled all across Mexico in less than 2 days. No wonder why America is doing so bad in geography"
Prom Night             ,drownnnsoda,1,horror,2008,3,"""Prom Night"" is a title-only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. This movie takes place in an Oregon town, where Donna (Brittany Snow) is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years. She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives. Little does anyone know, a man from Donna's past, who has haunted her for years, is also at the prom... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her.I'm a fan of the original ""Prom Night"", so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but I have to admit I was quite disappointed. ""Prom Night"" suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have, and that is predictability. There are absolutely no surprises here, and I felt I had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times, often better, before. What does this equate to for the audience? Boredom. Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the pre-teen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen. The plot is simplistic, but the entire script is void of any type of surprise, twist, atmosphere, or anything, and this really, really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into. It all just seemed very bland.A lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a PG-13 slasher movie as well, and I understand what they are saying, but I don't think it's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore. Take Carpenter's ""Halloween"" for example - little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie. You don't need gore to make a film scary, but even had ""Prom Night"" been gratuitously violent (which it is not, it is very tame), it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with. The tension and suspense here is mild at best, and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99% of the time. Our characters aren't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them, and their by-the-numbers demises are routine and careless.I will point out a few things I did like about this movie, though, because it wasn't completely useless - the cinematography is really nice, and everything was very well-filmed and fairly stylish. Among the ""jump"" scares (that are for the most part very predictable), there were a few that were kind of clever. The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be. As for the acting, it's mediocre at best. Brittany Snow plays the lead decently, but really the rest of the cast doesn't show off much talent. Johnathan Schaech plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he isn't that impressive. However, I did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical 'masked-stalker' type killer we see a lot. As far as the ending goes, the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit's end and it was very anti-climactic.Overall, ""Prom Night"" was a disappointment. Everything was very by-the-numbers, routine, and predictable, which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie. There were a few neat moments, but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere, and had little plot development, nor believable characters. I'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video, or rent the original instead, because there are absolutely no surprises here. Some may find a little entertainment in it, but it was far too predictable for my tastes. I expected better, and left the theater very disappointed. 3/10."
Quarantine             ,iamyourruler2000,1,horror,2008,7,"I have to say, this whole hysteria of America ruining foreign films is laughable. Yes, there are some really bad remakes, but that does not effect the original film. You cannot ruin a film by remaking it as the original film is still the same. If you are angry, you are angry because you feel that people who really deserve the fame and recognition are not getting it. This is a justified reason to be angry, but don't go saying the film has been ruined because that defies all logic of possibility.I must say it's hard for me to review this film without thinking about the original, mainly because it is nearly a shot for shot remake. Obviously this takes away from the suspense and overall fear factor of the film. If you have seen the original, don't expect to experience the same level of terror that you had the first go round. You're going to know what's coming for the most part. If you haven't seen REC, this movie will probably scare you. If you actually have the option of seeing REC first, I would do it because I feel that it is still the superior movie. Of course, if you live in America your local video store won't have it and you'll have to download it illegally, so I guess you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.I actually thought the acting was quite good for the most part. Jennifer Carpenter does a great job playing hysterical women. She did a good job being hysterical in the Emily Rose abomination and she did a good job being hysterical in Dexter. She does a good job being hysterical in this movie as well, so kudos to the producers/directors for making a logical choice to cast her. Her dialogue outside of being chased down by rabid tenants is laughable, but this actually makes sense when you consider the fact she's a reporter for a show no one would watch anyways.The main difference between REC and this movie is the cause of the deranged building tenants. Surprisingly, I thought they made the story work and it played more on ""American"" fears such as government distrust, terrorism, and viral warfare. The only thing I think they failed on was the choice to use higher quality production. Part of what made REC really scary was the grittiness which gave you the feeling that what was happening was real. Although the camera work is choreographed well, the Hollywood quality takes away the grit and leaves you feeling like you've had a few too many before watching.Overall, I think this is actually a decent remake. The producers and director realized that the story was already awesome and they didn't try to change it. I think if people would calm down and put aside their national pride and cultural elitism, they would realize that these kinds of remakes only help foreign films. How many people knew about REC before this movie, outside of a small demographic of people (imdb is not the 'norm')? How many people know about that great movie now? Lots of people visit these websites looking for reviews, and seeing ""REC"" pop up everywhere is only good exposure. Hell, if this movie does well you might actually find copies of REC in your local video store, and believe me, I'd be the first in line to buy a copy."
Julia             ,Quinoa1984,1,crime,2009,10,"Not everyone will want to see Julia. It's not a 'happy' picture, and its bleakness is compounded by an ending that is bittersweet only inasmuch that the main characters are (spoiler alert) still alive. And not too many people rush out to see a two hour and twenty minute movie with Tilda Swinton (albeit a recent well-deserved Oscar winner) playing an alcoholic floozy who takes a chance to make a lot of money by kidnapping a kid who at first she's getting done for the boy's mother, only to find herself in deeper trouble south of the border. But for those of us that would be interested in seeing another hard-hitting drama with Tilda Swinton in the lead (think back, for those who might remember, to the likes of The Deep End), it's a kind of intense bliss. It's also one of the more unusual kidnapper stories ever told, mayhap.In the movie Tilda Swinton is Julia, who is so bad at her alcoholism she shows up to an AA meeting only to leave a minute into it and stand in the lobby smoking cigarettes. She's lost her job, she has a wax-on-wax-off relationship with a former drunk (Saul Rubinek), and is listening with half-ears-open to an unstable Mexican woman who wants to see her son again. She tells Julia she can get rich, very rich, since the kid's grandfather has a lot of money with his company. So Julia, in her desperation and debts mounting, goes for the task and kidnaps the kid while out playing in the woods. She wears a black mask in front of the kid (looking, the Mexican mother comments, ""like a demon""), but soon takes it off when trust is reached between them. She also isn't sure what to do, and by a kind of crazy twist of fate (i.e. driving maniacally through the desert to lose a helicopter following a bunch of illegals crossing the border), she winds up in Tijuana.This is already an hour and a half into the movie, and there's still plenty more to go here. I could spoil everything else that happens in the film, but it would spoil not so much the 'fun' but the harrowing irony that befalls Julia just on the tip of getting two million (suffice to say, think Man on Fire, only less Tony Scott and more... realistic). Yet Julia doesn't get bogged down in melodrama, and you don't even realize that much time has passed. It's a long movie, but you get wrapped up in Julia's struggle; she's an anti-hero in a definite term, and because she's played by Swinton as a strong and determined 'dame' with nothing to lose we stick with her wherever her story takes her.And while I would hope to give Swinton as much praise as possible, since it is such a brave performance that calls up all of her skills as an actress, foregoing any BS Hollywood star ego for down-and-dirty scenes in Tijuana and up against non-professional players in the Mexico locations, it's also Erick Zonca's movie. One may recall his achievement with The Dreamlife of Angels, about two young French women living in an apartment with various dramas, but this time with Julia he takes things into a kind of dark, naturalistic fable. He gives some moments for us to breathe in-between those tense scenes between Swinton and the boy, or in those later Mexico scenes, to really take in landscapes and the scenery, that desert Julia takes Tom to hide in, or the rough beauty of the streets of Tijuana, or even in that opening scene at the bar that sets up Julia as this unlikely protagonist.Zonca's made with Julia a morality play rich in thrills and poetic irony in the guise of a neo-noir, and cast it with an actress who won't make a character sympathetic for the sake of it but real enough for us to understand her every step of the wa"
La siciliana ribelle             ,LorettaMath,1,crime,2014,NA,"One of the reviewers (from Minneapolis) said ""bad choice of casting the leading actress prone to overacting."" Nope. Growing in a NY Neapolitan/Sicilian neighborhood, I didn't see her overacting. That's just the way my BFFs were. Dramatic. Passionate. Over the top. I found her performance an honest portrayal. (And laughed at the scene where the cop buys her colorful clothes, b/c everyone in NY, Sicilian or not...wears black.) PS: My family visited Sicily the year this trial took place. I remember the guards w/Uzis both out side the Palace of Justice and in the airport.And I'd give this movie an 8."
Hancock             ,mario_c,0,action,2008,1,"OK, I must admit I'm not a fan of the Super Hero movie type. Generally I don't use to watch it and I don't use to appreciate it, but even so I can distinct when it is a good Super Hero movie, or a bad one, full of clichés and ""Hollywood garbage""! That said, I just can tell you my opinion about this movie: it sucks! But it sucks so badly! Aside from some nice jokes and some cool special effects, this movie has nothing interesting to offer! The plot is pathetic and gets even worse when it starts being melodramatic. The characters are laughable and absurd, even for a Super Hero movie, and if it's true that a Super Hero film can be entertaining, at least for the action or the jokes, this one completely spoils these two positive features with a completely absurd and melodramatic plot! And that ending, Oh my God, that was definitely too bad! To sum up: Bad job<U+0085> asshole (I can call you that how many times I want!)<U+0085>"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,bonesbaby33,1,misc,2019,5,"I liked the first movie. It had heart. Even though the girls were far apart, you felt like the pants did connect them via some magical power. The sequel is so plot-thin. The characters also struggle with the same things as last time. Lena has to fight for what she wants. Bridget has to stop running away from pain. Tibby has to let people in on her pain. And Carmen struggles with insecurity and feeling left out/alone. While these are all relatable feelings, they're basically repeats from the first movie and they aren't explored in any great ways. I feel like the first movie depicted the pain of three of the girls pretty well (all except Lena...that girl doesn't have a real problem, they just had to invent one for her). This movie felt extra disjointed and roboti"
Nights in Rodanthe             ,hollyyybuggg07,1,drama,2008,9,"Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much. It's a great movie with a great story line.It's about never giving up on finding that one, the one that will change you forever. The one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of life.I have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever, which is what Gere's character did to Lane's. I met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that I never forgot him or how smitten I was with him until I 'met' him again a year later. For me I could relate to this movie with my whole heart. I think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, great work Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere!"
Kisses             ,Turfseer,1,drama,2011,NA,"Set in Ireland, Kisses chronicles two lower middle-class children, next-door neighbors Kylie and Dylan, who run away to the big city (Dublin) after they can no longer tolerate their abusive home situations. The inciting incident that propels Dylan to actually leave home (joined by Kylie) is when he hits his father in an attempt to stop him from beating up his mother during a drunken argument. Later we find out that Kylie has been sexually abused at the hands of her Uncle, so she too has no qualms about running away.Writer/Director Lance Daly does a fantastic job in coaching the two first-time child actors, Kelly O'Neill and Shane Curry. Their language is very coarse and you'll have a hard time understanding what they're saying, without reading the English subtitles that appear on screen (yes, the actors are speaking English, but with a very heavy Irish accent). In fact, Daly brilliantly evokes an atmosphere of a violent middle-class world the children must exist in, utilizing dialogue which is peppered with all kinds of offbeat expletives and fascinating slang.The time the children spend at home is shot in black and white, which is designed to signify the repressive atmosphere they live in. But once the children flee to Dublin, the scenes are now in color, connoting freedom from repression. Daly does well in providing us a snapshot of how bad some of these abusive family situations can be in Ireland today but by the same token, I wonder if he went too far in damning these abusive parental figures. What would have been better if he showed us that these parents were capable of moments of humanity, which would have fleshed their characters out a bit more. Some parental concern and guilt feelings were on display when we hear snatches of the parents being interviewed on radio, after the children are declared missing; but it would have been better, had Daly made the parents a tad bit more sympathetic, and hence multidimensional, from the get-go.The 'second act' of the film is a mixed bag. Daly spends a little too much time with the children interacting with a kindly barge operator on a canal as he brings them into the city proper. Once in the city, however, there are all kinds of nice touches: the children avoid some kindly child welfare workers who they fear will simply return them to their parents; Dylan receives a kiss on the cheek from a prostitute that appears heartfelt; and they realistically fail to find Dylan's older brother, who ran away to the big city two years before.Bob Dylan also figures prominently in this film. The barge operator first introduces the children to Dylan by singing a Dylan song and playing the harmonica. Later, a folk artist is singing a Dylan song at a mall where the children assist him in begging for money. Finally, the children run into a man at a stage door during a concert, who appears to be Dylan himself. It turns out that he's only a Dylan imitator, part of an Australian tribute band. We hear Dylan's 'Shelter from the Storm' as part of the film's soundtrack which is apropos, since the children are seeking 'shelter' in the big city, far from the 'storm' of their respective abusive domestic situations.The second act crisis occurs when Kylie is kidnapped by pedophiles, who snatch her off the street and drive off in a car. I had a hard time believing that Dylan would be able to hold on to the back of the car as they bad guys sped off at top speed. The children's' eventual escape also seems far-fetched but when they finally fall asleep and wake up with the dead body next to them, that was something that could possibly happen.The ending features the nice touch of seeing the parents relieved but then turning vindictive, as the children are returned to them. Dylan and Kylie exchange trusting glances as they are separated from one another and are brusquely brought back into their respective homes.Not all of the Kisses' plot is completely plausible nor are the characters (other than the principals), fully realized. Nonetheless, the performances of these child actors are so sharp, that one will find oneself ignoring some of the film's aforementioned intrinsic shortcoming"
The Square             ,lee_eisenberg,0,crime,2010,8,"It helps to know absolutely nothing about ""The Square"" before watching it, just so that it can hit you harder. Nash Edgerton's film depicts an affair between construction foreman Ray (David Roberts) and housewife Carla (Claire van der Boom) which leads to disastrous events. The mud created by the rain in some scenes is nothing compared to what is happening as part of the plot. Many of the shots are not lit entirely, adding to the unpleasant feeling.Without a doubt, the movie portrays a much grittier side of Australia than we often see in movies. The land down under is often associated with Crocodile Dundee or Aboriginal culture. What ""The Square"" depicts is closer to what we see in Guy Ritchie's movies, except that the events here are no laughing matter. This is as gut-busting as can be, especially with what happens at the end. But don't get me wrong, it's definitely worth seeing...unless you have a weak stomach.Also starring Joel Edgerton, Anthony Hayes, Peter Phelps and Bill Hunter."
The Ruins             ,Theo Robertson,,adventure,2010,7,"A few years ago the word "" torture porn "" became a more and more common phrase involving cinema . With the exception of PASSION OF THE Christ they seemed to revolve around a formula of "" Backpackers meet up abroad , get kidnapped by indigenous nutters and get explicitly tortured to death . The end "" On the surface THE RUINS may be just another horror film where horny teenagers get bumped off one by one but dig a little deeper and you'll find something different . Oh and isn't that last sentence appropriate as to happens to these characters ? Set in Mexico some American backpackers meet a German who suggests visiting an ancient Mayan temple which the backpackers agree to , only to be attacked by some locals who kill one of their party and chase them up to the top of the temple . Why do they do this ? Strangely this inciting incident is never really explained but this shouldn't be taken as a massive criticism because it's an enigmatic horror film that whilst having some truly stomach churning effects never really talks down the audience . Both the director Smith and the screenwriter Smith combine to tell the story via the characters situation . By this I mean the audience are never one step ahead of the characters . When a plot turn - of which there are many - happens both the audience and characters see the revelation on screen at the same time . Certainly the whole premise of people being murdered and mutilated by semi intelligent flora is ridiculous but it's written , directed and acted with such conviction that the laughable becomes very credible within the film's running time . What THE RUINS sets apart from other films in the sub genre of torture porn is that there's a strong element of body horror along with character's optimism being crushed . These two aspects are summed up with one of the characters finding out that there's vines growing inside her . She has them graphically cut out "" Ah she's saved "" gasp both the backpackers and audience . She screams that they're not all been purged and cries that there's one inside her head . Sure enough a small bulge in her forehead moves around . Hopes are built up and quickly dashed in this pessimistic shocker All in all this is a rather memorable horror film . It's a film however that will not appeal in any shape or form to those who don't like gore . Interestingly enough I once had a conversation with a professional film critic that the banned video nasties of the 1980s are often tame compared to more mainstream horror films of the early 21st century and he agreed . You'd be very hard pressed to name a more stomach churning film than THE RUINS but that said it also concentrates on suspense and mystery and struggling against natural adversity which while perhaps not making a great horror certainly a very memorable one"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,misc,2008,7,"When I first saw the trailer for The Other Boleyn Girl, I have to admit, it looked good, but like it wasn't accurate. I am a huge history buff, especially in the time of England's dark ages, I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry, Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown, her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn't portray her well in this film, but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne, the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more ""oomph"" sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.The Boleyn has quite a family, a mother, father, a son, and two daughters. After failing at several attempts for Queen Catherine to have a son heir to King Henry's thrown, he wishes for a mistress. Sir Thomas Boleyn offers his daughter, Anne, but when King Henry sees Thomas's other daughter, Mary, he is smitten with her and wants her as his mistress. She gives birth to a son, but they are not married and she is looked down upon. Anne is given a second chance to come back after a marriage that was not granted and then annulled, but King Henry then falls for her and wishes her to give herself to him, but she puts up a fight and tells him not until she assumes the crown and to be his wife. But she fails to give him a son, her life depends on it as well sadly.The true story of Anne Boleyn is very sad, but extremely interesting, I wouldn't recommend the book, just go for a regular history book when it comes to this story. But for the movie, The Other Boleyn Girl, I liked it, it had good acting, beautiful costumes and sets, and a very good story. If you are looking for a history lesson, this is not the film for you, but if you are looking for a good movie, then watch it. Just like the film ""Elizabeth"", they make the story a little more juicy, it's for the sake of some audience members who don't understand why England has the system it does, but it still makes for good drama.7/10"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,wonkakid91,0,animation,2008,3,"When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was showing at a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that the seats move). I take it that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min.) and also re-created to add the motion effects. It was a cute movie... but that was it. It was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit...well...trite. I was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I will say, the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. So all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring the younger kids... go for it. But if you are wanting to take your older kids, take them to another movie... they will thank you"
I Sell the Dead             ,ric_dagless,,misc,2008,9,"I saw this movie as part of the Midnite Madness at Sitges. Set in 18th century England, the plot covers the life of Arthur Blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his execution.The plot moves along via a series of misadventures involving Arthur and his partner encountering various unsavory characters and bizarre situations.The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the Hammer period horrors, the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards, rowdy tavern scenes and excellent set/costume design.For a movie titled I Sell the Dead, I was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror <U+0096> don't get me wrong there are some jumpy moments and gore, but the tone is very much comedic, driven by the situations the characters get themselves into and their dialog. The closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the character interaction seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, the Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise.The acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm lift the movie above many of the others on view in Sitges.Overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face."
Adoration             ,benjamin22,0,drama,2009,3,"I saw this film at a special screening with Q&A with director and cast and was really blown away by how not-good it really was. I saw ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and loved it and I guess I expected ""Adoration to be somehow in the same class of film.It was not.Adoration is a lot more like a student film, it was kind of embarrassing to watch in many parts and even more embarrassing to hear the cast and director talk about it as though it was a really thoughtful, well-made film. Don't get me wrong, I know they were trying very hard with this movie and it was intended to tackle all sorts of tough topics in a latter-period Godard sort of way, but it just didn't work.I don't know why there are so many good reviews coming out for this film, I'm fairly certain that most of the people who it will be unhappy about their experience. I saw it with four film-literate, film-working friends in Los Angeles and we were all disappointed.I really don't want to hate on films and filmmakers that have credibility but I don't want audiences to be misled into thinking this is even close to an enjoyable film, because it is not."
Lakeview Terrace             ,mgayles2005,0,crime,2008,NA,"After watching the trailer for ""Lakeview Terrace"" I had no idea the film was about racism. The trailer shows an interracial couple moving next door to a black cop and then being terrorized by him. But the motive for his actions isn't mentioned. Only in doing research did I learn that he's against the idea of an interracial couple. Why was it so hard to mention that? Maybe the studio thought too many people would be turned away by a movie about race, which makes me wonder why they made the movie in the first place.Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington play Chris and Lisa Mattson, an interracial couple who have just into a nice house in Lakeview Terrace, a beautiful Californian suburb. Samuel Jackson plays Abel Turner, an LAPD cop who's a strict father, and menacing cop, and a complete racist. Only minutes into the film we learn of his distaste for Kobe Bryant when his son puts on his jersey. I wonder why? He tells him to put on Shaq's jersey instead as if Shaq is any better role model.The movie starts off well. Turner has a good reason for dis-liking them in the beginning. Chris and Lisa have a public make out session in their pool while his kids watch from an upstairs window.How does Turner handle it? He disables their air conditioner. At that point it becomes clear that Turner is far beyond a typical racist, he's complete psycho. And that's when ""Lakeview Terrace"" looses all its credibility.Turner is supposed to be a dedicated father, whose sole purpose is to protect his kids. That gives him humanity. That makes him a believable character. But half way through the movie his kids are sent away so Abel can do things completely out of character, like hosting a bachelor party at three in the morning.I can't blame Samuel Jackson for creating such ludicrous character. His performance is decent, but certainly not his best work when it comes to yelling and acting crazy. Blame the writers. I imagine that at one point ""Lakeview Terrace"" was intended to be a realistic film about a real people in a real situation: an interracial couple moves next door to a bitter racist. But I'm sure that was changed to make the movie more exciting. The bitter racist was transformed into a bitter psycho racist who does things that no human being would ever do.I sure hope no one saw this movie expecting just a routine thriller. Films about race can be hard to stomach at times, I hope the people that saw this movie knew what they were getting. But despite themes of race, this movie has nothing to say about race. It's a silly movie that just uses racism as an easy motivation for one character to terrorize another.There are several opportunities where the film makers had a chance to say something about race. Turner's daughter wonders what it would be like to date a white boy that she likes. Well as interesting as that would be, it never happens. What a waste.Chris and Lisa mention children numerous times. And it becomes clear that bringing an interracial child into the world is an issue in this movie, but that sub plot has no pay off at all. What would Turner think of a mixed race child living next door? Well he never knows about it so what's the point? Despite my grievances with this film I must admit it is quite exciting. You never know what Turner is going to do next and creates genuine suspense. But that suspense isn't strong enough to cover the foul stench this film leaves behind when it ends. Not one minute of it is believable and each scene gets more ridiculous then the one before it. ""Lakeview Terrace"" seems to be a nice place to live, but the movie isn't worth the time.My grade: D"
The Strangers             ,Averlienb,,horror,2012,3,"I've watched many horror movies before, some are boring, some are creepy.This movie is creepily boring.It's started slow and vague; I have no idea what's going on with the main characters at least until minute 15.It has a few moments where viewers led to believe that some action is finally going on, but the moments will die down without anything notable. The uses of loud noises instead of some real thrilling scenes are utterly annoying.The end is just horrible. Viewers never know what's the motive of the murderers, never even shown the faces, least of all who they are and where they came from. Sure the film makers use the ""the murderers can be anyone and the killing can happen to anybody"" excuse, but then what's the point of making a movie when 80% of the storyline is left to the audience's imagination?To save everyone from having a cardiac arrest, be prepared for a loud scream from Liv Tyler at the last scene. It's not scary nor interesting, just lame."
Wanted             ,poyntblank64,1,action,2008,8,"If you watch this movie with a closed mind you might not care for it.Just take it as it is and it is very good. The special effects are excellent and action is non-stopped. There are plenty of jaw-dropping moments in this movie.Chances are that most of the stunts are highly unlikely, but you're watching a movie, purpose to entertain.

Sex and the City             ,matt75-1,1,comedy,2008,1,"This movie was such a disappointment: so disrespectful to the series, the characters' original complexity, and women's complexity!I was particularly let down by the script. First of all, the jokes were not funny. From the 'Saint Louise from St Louis' to Charlotte's Mexican incident, everything was so unlike Michael P King's style. Then the plot: predictable (Samantha's ring/ Smith being the guy getting it to her; the password of Carrie's email folder being 'love' like on the key chain...) but most of all characters were out of their 'tv series' parts. Especially Carrie: hitting Big with the wedding bouquet and screaming at him in the middle of 5th ave, really?!? Planning a honeymoon in Mexico, really (btw, the guy greets them with 'welcome to Mexico', that's <U+0085>'broad' and silly<U+0085>)?!? Telling Miranda 'you ruined my wedding', really? That dinner scene seemed like out of an episode of The Hills<U+0085>.I personally also found Jennifer Hudson terrible: she already won the 2008 Razzie to me (altough I should check if Sharon Stone is coming out with a new movie...).In general, if you think of what you saw in this movie without the affection you have for these characters, you must admit this is a terribly corny romantic comedy.Think of how wonderfully touching and poignant some episodes were. Like the one when Miranda finally took the courage to tell her feelings to Steve... It was titled 'One', and it was indeed a fully satisfying, beautiful episode.This movie is just a 1/10... "
Deception             ,Seersha1,0,crime,2008,5,"This movie is supposed to be a thriller, but is unfortunately quite short of ""thrills"".My biggest complaint would be the movie's pace - it is very slow, and at times quite boring.There are far too many implausabilities and plot holes, but even if you suspend your disbelief and just accept the story being told, it's still not a very good movie. The script just isn't very good.This is by no means the worst movie ever, however if you're looking for a GOOD thriller, I would not recommend this movie as one.It's a shame really, because Hugh needs another good movie to boost his career. His last few have not been critical or box office smash hits (save the X-Men franchise), and I'm starting to seriously doubt his ability to pick good scripts. Hopefully ""Australia"" will turn his sadly not- so-good streak around."
Untraceable             ,moviesaccordingtodes,1,crime,2010,9,"Amazing, Amazing movie! This is the first good thriller I have seen in a very long time. The acting was fantastic; this movie was overflowing with well respected actors and actresses like Diane Lane, Peter Lewis, Billy Burke, and Colin Hanks. The plot was intelligent and original. It was suitable for the times we are currently living in. There is now a new type of crime, crimes committed over the internet. This is one of the first movies to be released that deals with murder by way of computer. It was horrifying to watch and to think about but I suppose it can happen and we, as a society living in the times that we do, should be made aware of.I was on the edge of my seat for a good portion of the movie. It was a mystery for about half of the movie but then they just flat out tell you who the killer is, which surprised me very much. It changed the entire mood of the film. It went from trying to figure out who the killer is to trying to catch him before he got you first. The ending was excellent. It ended quickly; all of a sudden it was over. But I liked it like that because it was shocking and then it was over. The ending was brilliant; I would have it no other way."

Oh, I mean that without any innuendo, I found out beforehand that despite the movie's controversial theme, there was no nudity involved for ""my little heroine"", and for those of you who saw her bare back, remember, that is all you saw, that was all done from a certain angle.But, getting back to the movie itself, the general consensus here on IMDb is of an under-performer, a disappointment, a wasted effort, and I have to agree, but only in part. The movie is by no means bad, it just lacks proper direction, meandering like lost little rivulets finally converging, but by then, you're fed up already with the scene changing to some other characters just as you finally get into watching.From my own viewpoint, I only wanted the April story-line, so you can imagine how much that little homeless half-Oriental dude's singing got into my way.You also cannot take the characters seriously. A little thing it might be, but in this day and age, would a young professional like Sally St. Claire step into gum with her high heels (ooh eek! horrors! a piece of gum! ooh help!) and then stand there offering her leg to a motorcyclist so that he could remove her shoe, cradling her bare foot, and wipe off the offending wad? It is also never explained whether that guy was stalking his dream girl from ten years before. Oh, well, such coincidences might happen in Hollywood, of course.And, hey, as for Sally, everybody here makes her sound like Evil Incarnate. Business lady who smooths her way with little pot samples.

I loved the cheese curls and the walking rocks and some of the songs...and I just had a good time. I'm not sure that this really required to be on the big screen at ten bucks a head, but its better than the Weinstein's Doogal or Happily N'ever After or some of the other poor animated films of late, so I shouldn't complain since I had a good time watching it.

Stop-Loss             ,kairingler,0,drama,2009,9,"i thought that this was a very compelling movie.. lot's of good character development, ryan phillipe was great in this, he really knocked it out of the park with this one, he plays a staff seargeant who comes home a ""hero"" from Iraq, there is a parade , the whole town comes out , the senator is there and tells him anything you need son, come look me up. so him and his buddies spend a few days at home over the weekend catching up with their wives girlfriends,, and what not, things get rowdy and lot's of drinking happens, usual stuff. so on Monday morning our hero goes back to the office to get his official discharge papers,, well to his chagrin, he is sent back to iraq for another tour of duty, this little known ""trick"" in the military is in the fine print,, basically it says , the president can extened you're military term in time of war.. well in this particular case the war was already declared over years ago,, there you can see our hero's dilemma should he suck it up and go back or fight the system. he decides to fight the system going AWOL.. that's absent without leave.. first he tries canada then d.c. then Mexico.. and were not to the end yet. very compelling movie, it's grips you to the core, and makes you wanna get up and do something about getting our boys back in one piece from Iraq which we have no business being there in the first plac"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,bob-rutzel-1,0,adventure,2010,8,"Ex-convict Brett (Hurt) hitches a ride to New Orleans with two teenagers: Martine (Stewart) and Gordy (Redmayne). All three are lost and looking for someone to care.Ever notice that many of the movies out today have the main character as coming out of prison? It does open up all kinds of possibilities. Well, that is what we have here. I would say there could have been some uncomfortable moments with these three, but not to worry. It's all good. And, this is Brett's story and the kids get him to reveal it as they trek to New Orleans, and what a story it is. All throughout I kept an eye and an ear to anything that would refer to a Yellow Handkerchief. I kept asking why in the world would someone title this as that and never mention or show anything close? Okay, to be fair, there was a clue: May (Bello) did have a yellow sail on her boat. HA ! Hardly a handkerchief. I don't think I have ever seen a yellow sail on a boat. Until now. The acting by all three was exceptional. Hurt's understated role spoke volumes and carried the movie. Stewart surprised me and I believe she can run with the big dogs (Yeah, it's hard to let it go). Redmayne's character, while as obnoxious and annoying as the script called for, actually grew before our eyes. Redmayne showed he has range. And, Bello was sexy, beautiful and perfect as Brett's love interest. A very touching and honest love story. You might want to have a box of Kleenex within easy reach near the end of this movie. I'm just saying. But this is 2010, and the movie is listed as 2008. What happened? Why wasn't it out sooner? We'll never know.Violence: Yes, but mild.

Quarantine             ,justin_currie,1,horror,2008,7,"I went into this movie with fairly vague expectations - however I am a fan of scary movies, and not to mention a big fan of Jennifer Carpenter, could be good times. so lets go.woah.This movie was horribly fantastic! It was a ride, a very scary, very stressful ride, but an awesome one. True, this flick does not stray far from the typical zombie flick concepts, but I thought the execution was above par. The 1st person views, the sense of confinement/hopelessness, and the great acting (especially ms carpenter, extremely believable job of someone going hysterically frantic) One of the key things about this horror is the scares never let up, there is rarely a ""breather scene"" where you get to relax for any amount of time, it just keeps hitting you and hitting you.haha, phew.

Nights in Rodanthe             ,sarahbogard,1,drama,2008,1,"I had been counting down the months to see this movie because this is my FAVORITE Nicholas Sparks book. I was so disappointed in this movie and I get very upset everyday I think about it. Please read the book it is WONDERFUL and in no way does the movie come anywhere close to touching you the way the book does. What upsets me the most is that this could have been the best romantic film since The Notebook but it just wasn't there. Diane Lane and Richard Gere are wonderful and I LOVE them in everything but the movie just wasn't there. So don't waste your time at the movies PLEASE read the book, you will not be disappointed in the book at all!"
W.             ,minman3-1,0,misc,2008,1,"Disappointing! While no person is perfect this portrays all in this fill as if they were all the three stooges and a power hungry leader that wanted to make the final decision. I cannot believe this is an accurate portrayal of individuals in privet conversations and in classified meetings. I have seen other Stone movies and enjoyed them and got the point. I think it may be time to retire and accomplish other life goals. To indicate that W. went to Iraq to get even for ""poppy"" and for oil was unrealistic and shows just how thin this story line really was developed. The acting was well done, with the individual mannerisms but the character of the individuals were corrupted from the people that we know them know them to be. I would have to rate this on as a must miss even on TV."
Summer Hours             ,pastier-1,1,drama,2009,5,"This film's plot and dialogue largely center on artists, designers, and their work -- paintings, sketchbooks, sculptures, and high-design furniture, display cases, armoires and vases, and the question of retaining, donating, or selling these rare and rarefied items after its owner dies.Sophisticated visual objects are the core of the movie, yet its own appearance is surprisingly nondescript. Far more often than not, the cinematography seems haphazard or banal, as though its only purpose was to depict the actors speaking in this very talky film, or follow them around when they move. Its esthetic lacks visual ambition or a compositional point of view.The art objects that are so important to the plot are treated indifferently -- we rarely see them depicted well or fully. No wonder that a majority of the deceased's children don't care about these treasures -- the director and cinematographer don't seem to either.Is all this a subliminal way for the director to suggest that art is highfalutin', and less important than people?"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,CowboysGuy2824,0,action,2008,9,"When it comes to reviewing a movie like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the hardest thing to do is to keep expectations intact and not expect a film that will blow Raiders of the Lost Ark out of the water. It has no chance to beat that expectation, and the film will ultimately become a failure with that mindset. You have to look at this film as another one of the sequels, which isn't a knock at the The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade; on the contrary, they're great films, but this is the caliber you should expect from the fourth installment of a film that hasn't seen a new addition to the franchise since 1989.With this in mind, does the fourth Indiana Jones film succeed? The answer? An incredibly enthusiastic yes! After 19 years away, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford have recaptured that magic that has made the Indy trilogy so successful and added a worthy sequel that stands right in line with the two sequels. The little Indy quirks are here: the Paramount logo fading into a mountain-like object in the background, Jones's insane phobia of snakes, the flight paths on the background maps, and the numerous references to the first three films. However, and give George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp a ton of credit for this, the film is not simply a tribute to the first three films, but an intriguing, fresh story that is unlike any of the other three. This isn't Rocky Balboa where we have the same general story but given a new spin on it. While some fans will be upset about the departure from the familiar, biblical territory the first ones covered, I found it to be great to see a new, original Indy flick instead of a rehashed homage to themes previously seen.Spielberg seems to have found that pitch perfect balance between action, humor, and humanity that made Raiders so special. This isn't a flat out comedy like Last Crusade seemingly was, though there is still plenty of humorous moments in this film (surprisingly, very few jokes and gags actually fall flat). This isn't two hours of non-stop action, as the film does take its time to establish the plot, detail the archaeological quests, and let us remember why we fell in love with these characters in the first place. In fact, the scenes with Marion Ravenwood and Indy together are gold. Don't get me wrong; a lot of the action is a blast. The car chase scene in the jungle is a great piece of film-making, and the first scene with Mutt Williams and Indy leave a lasting impression. Great action doesn't have to come in newer, advanced looking CGI extravaganzas, as Spielberg proves that traditional action set pieces are still the most entertaining kind there is.Now, about the cast. The star is aging, the sidekick is from Even Stevens, Karen Allen hasn't been in a big movie in God knows how many years, and, for some reason, people were worried about Cate Blanchett in here role. Well, let me put the concerns to rest: the entire cast is established pitch-perfect chemistry and everybody plays their parts incredibly well. Harrison Ford is, for the first time in a decade, having the time of his life and it shows in his excellent return to the famed American icon. It's no secret that he has been campaigning for this movie for years, and it shows in his strong performance. Karen Allen shares fantastic chemistry with both Shia LaBeouf and Ford, as she provides a lot of the necessary charm to the second act of the film. Blanchett uses a heavily over-the-top Russian accent, but she finds just the right note between creepy and intriguing to make her the best Indy villain since Belloq in Raiders. Ray Winstone does well enough in his role, as does John Hurt and Jim Broadbent.The major surprise, however, is indeed Shia LaBeouf. For some strange reason, people actually thought this guy would be the Jar Jar Binks of the Indy series, and they couldn't be more wrong. Remember the outstanding chemistry between Sean Connery and Ford in The Last Crusade? The chemistry between LaBeouf and Ford rivals that. I've believe that he's been a very good actor for the past few years (and one of the few redeeming factors of Transformers). He does a great job in this film. The entire cast is good.A strong story and great performances don't imply that this film isn't flawless. It isn't, but the flaws are few-and-far between and didn't hinder my overall enjoyment of the film. The first 20 minutes are somewhat slow; it takes a little while to get to Marshall College. These first twenty minute aren't necessarily boring; it is still entertaining, but it could have used probably 5 minutes of edits and pacing corrections. This is my biggest problem with the film, and once Indy returns to Marshall College, the film really kicks off and turns into the roller coaster ride that everyone has been hoping for.So, as you can see, I dug the film. I may have even loved it (repeat viewings should ensure this). It is the Indy film that you've been waiting for since it was announced, and the creative trio have proved that, with the right care and intentions, you can bring an American icon back from the dead and still have him own the competition. Rip-offs like The DaVinci Code and the National Treasure series try to be like these films, but even the fourth installment of these wonderful franchise just towers over its impersonators. This film will go down as a very strong entry into the quartet and fall somewhere in the middle of the two sequels when all is said and done. The Indy film that you've been dreading? Not even close.Indiana Jones is back. 2"

The beauty of its title, the sweetness and affirming image of a yellow handkerchief...like a yellow ribbon is about waiting,welcome and coming home. The Yellow Handkerchief is a road trip movie. It is a quiet, quirky ride around the roads of Louisiana. It plays like real people who make real reconciliations and whose lives keep us captured and moving and flowing forward.

The Yellow Handkerchief             ,mdnobles19,0,adventure,2011,8,"I really enjoyed this movie! The performances were subtle, layered, charming and fascinating and I'm surprised this movie didn't get noticed during the awards season. The raw landscapes, isolated buildings and the retro car they make there journey to a fresh start all make a hauntingly beautiful setting. The movie has a quiet confidence, artistic and a involving, star crossed story that for the first half leaves you in suspense, it follows Brett Hanson played by William Hurt who was recently released after 6 years from prison for manslaughter and hitches a ride to go back home to his wife with a young duo Martine and Gordy played Kristen Stewart in another great indie performance and she was stunning in this movie, Eddie Redmayne plays an awkward oddball but in a touching way and Maria Bello who isn't seen as much plays the wife May was excellent as always and man is she sexy. It just has a great story told in a real, beautiful way and is very relatable that makes it even more effective topped off with a very satisfying and touching ending that makes this an almost flawless indie. Highly recommended! More of a 4.5 out of 5 stars"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,TheQuietStorm,1,drama,2008,6,"I caught an exclusive screening of this film a week back and I must say, it might be the best film featuring a mostly black cast since ""Antwone Fisher."" The story centers around Lily (Dakota Fanning), a poor, lonely little girl in the deep south, who deals with a tragic past and a miserable, cruel father (Paul Bettany). Her life revolves around dreams of being every bit like her deceased mother and her relationship with her caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson).In the midst of the civil rights movement, Rosaleen finds herself in some trouble with the locals, inspiring Lily to flee with her to a South Carolina town that she believes holds the secret to her mother's past. In this town, they find refuge with the Boatwright sisters (Queen Latifah, Alicia Keys and Sophie Okonedo), who take them in on the strength of a story concocted by Lily. Through their cultured world, filled with beekeeping, a lucrative honey business, religious beliefs and love, Lily finds the security she has longed for and finds the answers to questions that haunted her for years.The director (Prince-Brythewood) did a great job at making us care about the characters, even the miserable father played excellently by Paul Bettany. Alicia Keys shows that some R&B singers can actually perform well in a movie, playing the snooty June Boatwright. However, the best performances has to be between Fanning and Okonedo, who played the gentle, simple minded, manic depressive May Boatwright. If Okonedo reminded me less of Thandie Newton's character in ""Beloved,"" I would've predicted an Oscar nomination depending on this year's competition. Maybe there's one in store for Bettany? Its all left to be seen.The film has its flaws. It dragged for a good portion of the first thirty minutes as we watch Lily and Rosaleen mill about, doing mundane things in their pitiful lives. But then it really picks up when they meet the Boatwright sisters. The characters were balancing on a thin line between empathetic and sympathetic. You never want to be in the latter. And the filmmakers couldn't resist being a bit schmaltzy on occasion, making most of it play like a good after school special with nothing beyond two dimensionality. And my biggest problem with the film... anti-climatic.Overall, its a solid film and definitely worth the time in seeing. "
Mamma Mia!             ,rayclister,1,comedy,2008,7,"I did enjoy this romp in the Greek Islands and was surprised at how well Meryl Streep sang. It's light, full of froth and bubble and perhaps has some aspects of Grease and Bollywood in it. The reason the music works I feel is that they haven't really messed with the arrangements of the songs keeping them generally faithful to the Abba originals. But Pierce Brosnan's vocal efforts were abysmal, almost laughable. Perhaps it was meant to be a send up of the original songs all the way through but he really did manage to mangle the vocals in my opinion. If you have seen the musical on stage you will know what to expect and there are some funny moments in the film and the Greek islands are as always a superb backdrop for the action. 1"
The Incredible Hulk             ,schristian-6,0,action,2008,NA,"I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should ""Hulk Smash"" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else. 1"
35 Shots of Rum             ,bandw,0,drama,2010,NA,"This movie opens with about ten minutes of watching commuter trains running around the Paris area. We get views from the inside as well as out. You begin to wonder what is going on, is this a film directed by some train obsessed person? But, no, the opening scenes set a mood and briefly introduce us to two of the main characters: Lionel, a train engineer, and Joséphine, his daughter. (Is it just a coincidence that Lionel's name is the same as the model train company's?)After the opening scenes we see Lional and Joséphine in their small but comfortable apartment in the Paris suburbs. Details of their ordinary domestic life are presented at some length. Lional and Joséphine are so at ease with each other that you assume they are husband and wife, but then you are surprised to learn they are father and daughter. Finally we are introduced to the two other people in the apartment complex whose lives intertwine with Lionel and Josèpine: Gabrielle, a taxi driver who has had more than a casual interest in Lionel for many years, and Noé, a young, peripatetic bohemian who has interest in Joséphine. Following the shifting relationships among these four people is the substance of the movie.Dramatic tensions are developed with quiet subtly. Those seeking histrionics will not find them here. The pivotal scene has no dialog. While dancing in a café to the Commodores ""Nightshift"" and Ralph Tamer's ""Siboney,"" the entire emotional tone between the characters turns. What a beautiful scene.What attracted me to this film was the gradual way we learn about the people and come to care about them. In contrast, however, compressed into the final scenes are surprising revelations.If you like quiet, character-driven films, then you will probably like this. Otherwise, probably not."

JULIA will continue to ricochet around your brain, tumultuously, long after viewing. KUDOS to Ms. Swinton! After her Oscar winning role as the anal-retentive executive you love to hate in Michael Clayton, she seemed like a truly excellent actor. With this ground-breaking, Oscar-caliber performance, there can be no doubt her acting skills are nothing short of legendary! The only actor who could hold her own on camera w/Swinton was Kate del Castillo(Under the Same Moon), who turns in a brief, but incredibly intense performance as the disturbed biological mother.Remember how the Supreme Court used to define pornography? ""Totally and utterly devoid of any redeeming social value""- What's mystical about Ms. Swinton's performance is that despite portraying a detestable and neurotically unpredictable adult, she manages to plant a seed of expectation/compassion in the viewer's mind.

Flash of Genius             ,aenthal,0,misc,2008,4,"Though this is passed off as a true story, the details are so changed from reality that the only real thing left are the ""blinking eye"" wiper blades and the names of the characters and car companies. Dennis Kearnes was a far more unlikable, obsessed, and dramatic person than this movie lets on. Most glaringly fictitious is his David against Goliath legal fight against the big bad corporation, where he is portrayed as representing himself all alone (with the legal clerking of his kids). It isn't true. He WAS represented by lawyers in his suit against Ford Motor Company. Google his REAL life and you will find a colorful nut case, who could have made a great biographical figure. But he couldn't make a sympathetic figure. So Hollywood sweetened him up, taking away the drama and conflict to make him a hero for the plot. Just like you know when you see a movie about the Titanic, that the ship will sink in the end, there is no suspense to the court trial (last third of the movie). There would have been no movie if he lost the case."

It is a cool movie. Over protective parents is a majority phenomenon. In other words, a large portion of planet earth has over protective parents and this is a good non-exaggerative portrayal of such a phenomenon. In my hood, all my neighbors were like this and even my parents had some elements of over protectiveness. I was embarrassed by it on a number of occasions, but I certainly do cherish those memories of over protection, thought I don't endorse it. People, just lighten up!

Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,cakemossss,1,comedy,2009,1,"This movie appeared as its predecessors, knocked up, 40 yr old virgin, to be crude and immature but with occasional funny parts worthy of a Saturday night at home. This was not so, the movie stars an undefined characterless loser with no personality who, i guess is supposed to develop and grow into something more during the movie. Well that doesn't happen. We get to see his sagging penis flashed throughout the movie though (i suppose the writers were so frustrated with their inability to actually develop a worthwhile plot that they thought throwing in full frontal male nudity would make make up for its overall dreary stupidity, it only made it worse). The films continual crude scenes of awkward sex and the general focus on actual intercourse further added to its vitriol and made it seem like it was written by a 13 year old boy. which seems likely. The plot descended into such nothingness, i honestly stopped watching halfway through. I thought Russell brand would make the movie marginally worthwhile, but his personality doesn't even make whimper. All in all, plot= vacuous, acting= bad bad horrible, especially the vapid potato head who blessed the lead role , and don't , for the love of god watch this with your family. its so stupidly crude that you wont want to look each other in the eye after watching it. good lord, what a waste of 1 1/2 hours.."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,lavatch,1,misc,2008,NA,"The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling film due to the exceptional performances and the splendid costumes. Additionally, there is simply a terrific story told about the relationship of Henry VIII and the two Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary.Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) are outstanding as characters engaged in both sibling rivalry and sisterly bonding. In the central relationship of the sisters, the film develops the social roles and imposed limitations on women in Tudor England.One of the film's most moving character portrayals is the mother of the two Boleyn Sisters. In the heartbreaking performance of Kristin Scott Thomas, Elizabeth Boleyn can only watch helplessly as her daughters become pawns of the greedy men (Thomas Boleyn and the Duke of Norfolk), who use the young women much like pimps in order to line their pockets and further their own advancement at court. Another sterling aspect of the film is the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), another victim of the men due to the obsessive pursuit of Henry VIII to beget a male heir, leading to his momentous divorce from Katherine and England's break with the church of Rome.While commentators may point out the omissions of many of the details from the novel by Philippa Gregory, the film is still true to the spirit of the book. It is also a faithful representation of the role of women in Tudor age. The film effectively presents the gender issues from the perspective of many of the remarkable women of the age along with the reminder of the greatest legacy of Anne Boleyn, which was the indirect result of her relationship of Henry VIII. That legacy was the future ruler of England...and also a woman: Elizabeth I. 1"
Untraceable             ,huiyt,1,crime,2008,4,"Movie was slow moving in general, the plot was simplistic and is a smash between the Saw series and a CSI episode, but potentially less entertaining than either of the two. There was gore and disturbing content which in my opinion may have been inappropriate for the story. It could have been just as powerful without the disturbing pseudo-snuff film scenes as a police film and the suspense could be maximized, or the director should have made the call to make it more like a Saw movie, maintain the disturbing content and bring that fan base in. The target in my opinion was broad, drew in viewers who will be disappointed. Overall, if the movie moved a little quicker, or was potentially less graphic it might have earned a 6. To sum it all up, it was 20 minutes longer than it should have been and was misguided. Potentially worth a rental but even questionable in that case. 1"
Nights in Rodanthe             ,preppy-3,1,drama,2008,7,"Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film. It's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There's tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). The great acting by Gere and Lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much. Every single bit of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. Also it's far too short--I didn't believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly. Still the movie does work. The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. So it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. It doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. I give it a 7."
35 Shots of Rum             ,Mancic2000,0,drama,2009,NA,"I like it when the movie title itself is capable of concisely threading together the themes of the movie and yet retains a unique symbolic connotation. ""35 shots of rum"" is a good example. The audience were left with a question mark as to what the ""35 shots of rum theory"" meant to the father early on in the movie, and when leaving the cinema were probably rewarded with a sonorous answer which neatly highlights and summarises the point of the movie.In a working class Parisian family which is disintegrated by the loss of an important member, what bonds the remaining members together and keep them going? What prevents them from lying flat on the rail and let trains run all over them and wrap them up as some may choose to? ""35 shots of rum"" provides us with a sincere, heartfelt and highly humanised conjecture through unraveling an intimate web of relationships within the family and the neighbourhood, and reveals to the audience what meanings of life are to the characters. The story-telling is commendable and loyal to its central film throughout, making the film a structurally condensed and coherent piece of study of humanity."
A Christmas Tale             ,Hitchcoc,1,comedy,2011,8,"I thought that this was a tight film, with fine performances. The fact that I couldn't stand any of the self-righteous jerks that permeate it didn't really distract from it. I learned a long time ago that films can have weak and even evil figures who are still really interesting. This family has done so much harm to its members that nothing is really going to repair it. The figure we care the most about has a death sentence She sets things in motion, but has no motivation other than that. The dysfunctional bunch clashes and bumps and sobs and carries on and the chips are still falling. The free spirit who has been thrown out of the family, basically, is the one who manages to eventually leave unscathed, but how he gets there is through his own general disinterest and insensitivity. Yet we do admire his spirit. The fact that it is Christmas does nothing other than force people together. See this if you don't mind feeling kind of bad afterward"

You are taken from laughing one moment to feeling as though your heart is being tugged out of your body in the next moment. I will definitely be recommending this film to my friends!"
Gran Torino             ,olofsson501,0,drama,2008,9,"This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The ""olidish"" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now. 2"
What Happens in Vegas             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,comedy,2008,5,"When I first saw the trailer to What Happens in Vegas..., I thought it did look so predictable, but it had some really funny moments in the trailer, so I still wanted to see it. The only sad part, we have Cameron Diaz(who looks like a really good looking aging woman) and Ashton Kutcher(who still looks and acts like he's 12 years old), so we have two obnoxious actors that could have made a very disastrous film. But I saw What Happens in Vegas... yesterday and even though it was very predictable and stupid, it still had some very funny moments. I mean, Cameron and Ashton play two of the most unlikeable characters in movie history, who just bicker back and forth. The characters who win you over in the film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, who's fighting is actually very funny. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too.Joy just got dumped by her boyfriend in front of her friends, Jack just got fired by his own father, so what's next for them? VEGAS! They happen to meet when their rooms get mixed up and end up drinking together, having a ball in Vegas, and end up accidentally marrying each other. When they come too, they realize it was a mistake, but start bickering, Joy leaves a quarter at her slot machine and Jack puts it in and wins 3 million dollars! But when it comes to the annulment, for some strange and unbelievable reason, the judge sentences them to 6 months hard marriage and freezes the money. So these two who have nothing in common battle it out, until of course they fall for each other.What Happens in Vegas... is silly and predictable, but I do think the rating her on IMDb is a little harsh. I completely side with people who hate Cameron and Ashton, but their battle scenes together are pretty funny. Just I've seen so many worse films, this was just a fun romantic comedy to lighten the spirit of Iron Man and Speed Racer, not to mention the more action packed movies for the summer. So I'd say it's worth the look, but more of a rental vs. a high priced ticket, but just have fun, I think you'll get more than a few laughs.5/10"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,SmileysWorld,,animation,2008,NA,"The veggies never cease to be entertaining.Our kids love them and I have an affection for them as well,but there are elements of this film that trouble me.While I suppose that there is a message that is Christian in nature in the film,God is never mentioned once,nor is the Bible or anything pertaining to it.In a normal Veggie Tales production,God is mentioned at least somewhere if not throughout.I find this troubling.Hopefully,the makers of this series will get back on the ball with their next production.Hopefully they have not forsaken what has endeared them to many people over the years and have sold out to mainstream Hollywood.This would be a rotten shame.Also,all of the usual VT characters get at least a small part in all or most of their productions,yet here this is not the case.We see only seconds of Bob the Tomato,and nothing at all of the French Peas or Junior Asparagus.This is not so much troubling as it is disappointing,I suppose.Overall,it's an entertaining watch,but in the end I see it as little more than an attempt to make a little dough off of a theme very popular in cinema these days:Pirates.So,Mike,Phil,if you ever read this,get back to those Christian values as quickly as you can and restore my sagging fait"
The Burning Plain             ,Chrysanthepop,1,misc,2011,NA,"Films about interlocked fragmented stories aren't anything new to writer and director Guillermo Arriaga. As director, 'The Burning Plain' is his first feature film and its quite apparent that he has poured his heart into it. Here too the film involves three stories that are told separately but linked by the first scene.However, the non-linearity of storytelling is initially confusing but once the tragic link is made apparent, the gut-wrenching conclusion (that explains the explosion shown in the first scene) hits the viewer hard. The setting is very simplistic but rich in atmosphere especially with the dark subtle undertones. The beautiful score contributes well.Arriaga has gathered an impressive ensemble of actors who deliver wonderfully understated performances. Charlize Theron portrays Sylvia with a subtle intensity. Kim Basinger is skillfully restrained and Jennifer Lawrence shows tremendous potential. John Corbett, Robin Tunney, José María Yazpik, Rachel Ticotin, Brett Cullen, Tessa Ia and Joaquin de Almeida provide great support.Despite the initial confusion, the narrative is strong. There are a few clichés that could have been avoided, such as the confession scene in the hospital, but these are very minor and don't effect the impact of the film. In the end, 'The Burning Plain' is a solid film."
Quarantine             ,fertilecelluloid,1,horror,2008,2,"Terribly repetitive, boring, and irritating horror pic. Shot -- again! -- in the horrible hand-held style of ""Cloverfield"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", it boasts a couple of jumps and dozens of jerky scuffles in the half dark that add up to a numbing experience. A literal remake of ""Rec"", a film I wasn't too fond of, it is all told from the viewpoint of a cameraman and a reporter (Jennifer Carpenter) who are shadowing some firemen for the night. When they enter a building where something resembling rabies has broken out, the so-called ""horror"" begins. I say so-called because there is nothing scary here. It's just noise and chaos. My first big problem with this remake was Carpenter's reporter character -- she's arrogant, smug, annoying, loud, and unprofessional. She's not a reporter's backside. I spent the whole movie wanting her to die. The hand-held, doco-style horror film has got to be buried. It has become such a cliché. When the filmmakers of ""Man Bites Dog"" employed it, it was effective. The hand-held material was also realistically shot. The professional news cameraman who is shooting this turkey would be pink slipped the moment the network copped a look at his footage. Why do filmmakers think that hand-held footage needs to look like a drunk is filming it? Empty horror movies made by and for ADD-ridden idiots are slowly driving me away from modern horror films. ""Quarantine"" should be quarantined for good so it can't infect another human eyeball."
Changeling             ,morgangster,1,misc,2008,8,"Clint Eastwood's newest project, Changeling, is sort of awesome, sort of annoying. The true story of Christine Collins, a telephone operator and single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, has a promising script and cast, but fails to accomplish any major feats on screen. At times the dialog feels forced. For example, when Jolie adds an ambient ""Sport"" moniker or makes references to Cleopatra. It's as if Eastwood is saying to the audience ""Yes, this really is 1928, I promise."" Historical accuracy is important in a film claiming truth, but Changeling is a bit like scaling a wall<U+0097> there is not much to hold on to.But what little there is to hold on to is both enjoyable and sophisticated. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine, gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who returns home from work to find that her son Walter is missing. In fact, Jolie might have scored a career best performance with Changeling, but it is hard to say whether or not this is enough to carry the film.Jolie holds her head high as a mother who loses her son and receives little help from the Los Angeles Police Department during the search. The 1920s were wrought with scandal for the L.A.P.D. and Christine Collins find herself in the midst of them. After months of search, the police return Walter to Christine only to find that she denies that he is her son. Despite the mounting evidence supporting her claim (her Walter is uncircumcised, the new Walter is not; the new Walter is 3 inches shorter, etc.), the police continually deny that there is anything wrong. Because of the recent scandals, the L.A.P.D does not want to admit any wrongdoing with the Collins case.The tone of this story seems to border between over-the-top melodrama and a dead-on homage to 1930s dramatic style. This is most notable in the scenes featuring Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) whose performance is cookie-cutter bad cop for the period. Eastwood navigates the ""bad cops"" with ease and never allows them to become satire, but it borders on the edge. Likewise with the necessary court scenes in the latter portion, Eastwood makes the material work, even if just barely. It is hard to diminish the negative affects of these melodramatic choices, but then again, it is a story about true events. Who am I to say whether or not the courtroom proceedings actually had that much fervor and zest? It is hard to find fault in conceivable truth.Another strong performance in the film comes from John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, a man determined to expose the misdeeds of the Los Angeles Police Department via his radio show. Briegleb vows to help Christine in her quest for her son as he believes that ""Walter"" is not the same boy. Malkovich gives a convincing role as a man of God, a man of principle, and a man of determination. He plays the hero, but never saddles up his white horse. His heroics come naturally as a man who wants the best for his city and the people within it<U+0097> his mission is never glitzy, never self-indulgent.Malkovich and Jolie together save the one part of the film that could have poisoned the entire piece. When Miss Collins refuses to be quiet on the issue of her son and is convinced by Briegleb to go public with the misdoings of the police, she is whisked off to a mental ward. Until she admits that she is making the whole impostor-son bit up, she will remain in the ward. The mental ward scenes were in complete discord with the rest of the film. The inclusion of stereotypical elements like electro-shock therapy and evil nurses allowed these scenes to toe the line of ridiculousness. If it were not for a convincing and levelheaded performance from Jolie, nothing good would have come from these scenes. And when Malkovich's character swoops in to save her from the grips of the ward and the police, it never once feels trite. Eastwood should really thank these two and consider the possibility of never, ever filming any hospital-like scenes ever again.The unsaturated color choice for the film gives an immediate feeling of doom and sadness for the picture, but a more upbeat, stylized look might have complimented the film better. The cinematography attempted to mirror the motif of the film but ended up missing the mark and falling more into dark and muddled than stylistically relevant.With the film clocking in a 140 minutes, it is impressive that it never feels that long. Eastwood navigates through a significant chunk of time with little duress and manages to take on a troubling story without being all too troubling. Easily an audience favorite and definite Oscar-bait, as the United States release is set for November under the title ""The Exchange."" This film is mass of ""in-betweens."" It is neither complex nor simple; neither heartfelt nor underwhelming. I find it hard to love it, but I do not hate it either. That's the problem: nothing clicks. It is within this realm that I find this film, more than anything else, a tad bit frustrating. It is a virtuous attempt and no doubt going to do well both in box office numbers and with awards. But because of that, I wanted more punch. I wanted more zing, more attitude. The film melts quickly in my mind and becomes just another biopic that might soon be forgotten. A little originality is crucial, especially for a film being considered for the Cannes Film Festival's highest honor. This film leaves me generally satisfied all whist thinking, ""Come on, Clint. You could've done better."" 1"
The Amazing Truth About Queen Raquela             ,Phyteas,1,misc,2009,NA,"Curiosity doesn't always kill the cat! I stumbled upon this movie at the Copenhagen ""Cinemateket"" during the Gay & Lesbian film festival. Having lived in France and the Philippines, and once having visited Iceland, I grew curious about the movie. I had heard about transsexuals while in the Philippines and had no opinion about them, but the film seemed to have some funny aspects, so I found myself a chaperon and there I went! I am glad I went, I unfortunately missed the first 5 or 10 minutes, but the rest did definitely leave its mark on me.I somewhat disagree with the movie tag line ""A Cinderella Story,"" there is some of ""this"" of course but it is only a side line. I read that the movie was first intended to be a documentary and that gives it a fast pace and veracity. It is actually quite difficult to distinguish between what would be fictional and what is reenacted. The acting is not always strict professional work but is intense and succeed in communicating feelings to the spectator...it works well! The plot seems sometimes to be ""too go to be true"" but the film moves on and keeps you interested until the end. Some the scenes are actually funny and the audience laughed more than once.It is a tale about ""differences,"" about ""weirdness"" and tolerance. The Elephant Man of David Lynch said ""I am a human being,"" this is never spelled out by Raquela but the message is the same and is delivered in a deep and moving way.I don't recall any embarrassing or disturbing scene, there is almost no nudity and always displayed in a non provocative way. Queen Raquela should not be categorized as a ""militant"" movie, it just a movie about life, a strange life, a non conventional life but absolutely human. I would be glad that Queen Raquela gets away from too many Gay & Lesbian film festivals and reaches a wider audience, it deserves i"
Adoration             ,Chris Knipp,0,drama,2009,8,"A boy tells a shocking lie, and it goes all over the Web. Somehow he uses the confusion he thus generates to explore his own identity and compensate for lost parents.Though blessed with warm and human performances and armed with a shocking premise, 'Adoration' is the quintessential think piece. There are potentially explosive events in more or less the present time, but the results are side-stepped or muted in order to focus on questions about religious conflict, guilt, and identity, among other things. The movie also sometimes becomes a rambling inquest, like Egoyan's memorable and celebrated The Sweet Hereafter. The latter hinges on the issue of what happened when a school bus ran off the road. Here there's a car crash whose causes are disturbingly ambiguous. And there's a young man who only knew his parents when he was very young. This time there are no answers forthcoming to any of the questions, only a chance perhaps of making peace with the past.Things begin in a high school French class. Sabine, the teacher, played by Egoyan's muse and wife Arsinée Khanjian, reads the class an account in French of how Israeli security discovered a pregnant woman who arrived on a plane from the West with plastic explosives and a detonator in her handbag. She was expecting to meet her Arab boyfriend in a couple days and marry him there near Jerusalem. The boyfriend apparently meant to have her, their unborn child, and the 400-plus passengers die en route to Israel.The students are supposed to submit a free translation of this news item. One boy, Simon (Devon Bostick), gets very creative indeed: he not only writes a version in which the would-be bomber and the pregnant fiancée are his own mother and father, but also puts out this tale as true on the Web and sets up a chat site where he discusses the pros and cons with online participants. These include outraged Jews, a Holocaust denier, a would-be terrorist, and miscellaneous argumentative teenagers, all of whom Simon observes and talks back to while playing with a pet mouse or munching on cereal in front of his Mac.Sabine teaches drama as well as French and wants Simon to present his story as a monologue-performance at a drama festival. Simon insists on maintaining the fiction that his story is true. Sabine gets fired for advocating the promotion of such explosive material. But further details of how this whole situation would play out go unexplored. The focus shifts to Simon's actual family situation, in which Sabine appears to be more and more involved.Simon's parents died a decade or so ago in a car crash and he has been raised by his uncle Tom (Scott Speedman), who drives a city tow truck and is strapped for money. Repeated odd encounters between Sabine and Tom follow. Tom's bossy, irascible, and racist father Morris, Simon's grandpa (Kenneth Welsh), has recently died, and there are scenes of Simon talking to the dying man and videotaping what he says. It's Christmastime, and Tom sets up a crèche with flat figures beautifully designed and painted by his parents.As the movie goes back and forth in time some of the events we see are happening only in Simon's mind. (It's not hard to keep these scenes straight, but they make the movie hovering and dreamy.) He imagines his parents if they were the bomber and the pregnant woman who flew to Israel unknowingly carrying a bomb. He also imagines their actual first meetings: his mother (Rachel Blanchard) was a violinist and Sami, his father (Noam Jenkins), was a violin maker. Sami evidently was Lebanese like Sabine (and Khanjian herself). Simon has his mother's violin, and Tom would like to sell it to pay debts. For Simon the violin becomes a key material link with his lost parents, particularly the top piece, the scroll, which his father changed on the original violin. The painted crèche figures also assume a symbolic family significance in Simon's mind that isn't quite so clear.At one point Sabine and Tom get into an altercation in a café with a taxi driver who threatens to throw up on them. This is about the only moment where Egoyan takes a break from his explorations of the themes like reality vs. fiction, moral responsibility, parenthood. These explorations wreck havoc on the narrative, which becomes more and more implausible, particularly in everything that concerns Sabine's role in events past and present. How are we to think of Simon's big lies? Are they justified by the debates they arouse? Egoyan just doesn't seem to care about working out the implications of the situations he has created.Though ""Jews"" and ""Jesus"" are mentioned, ""Muslims"" or ""Palestinians"" are not. Egoyan wants to keep the focus broad enough to draw in other massacres and injustices, such as that of the Armenians from whom he is descended. Nothing is resolved and narrative strands are left dangling. What happened when it got out that Simon had invented the story? What was Sabine really up to? Was Simon's uncle really so hard up for money? This feels a bit like Haneke's 'Caché,' but Egoyan lacks Haneke's ability to generate a sense of fear or outrage or his gift for stunning theatrical moments. However he uses his actors well. Khanjian has a way of chewing her words that's curiously appealing. Speedman has an unpredictable quality, the thing most needed here. As young Simon, Bostick projects calm and intelligence. He is the perfect ""eye"" of the piece.This is one of Egoyan's most intriguing and appealing works, even though it's full of logical holes. Ultimately Scott Foundas of the Village Voice is right when he calls 'Adoration' ""a movie considerably more absorbing to talk, write, and think about afterward than it is to actually watch."" Maybe that's enough. But don't expect to feel excited or rewarded when the credits roll. ________________"
35 Shots of Rum             ,chaos-rampant,0,drama,2014,NA,"I was looking for another film by this filmmaker, promised to two readers. Unable to find it, I turned to this. I count myself lucky. It's potent stuff if you can place yourself inside. One possible way is to note the Ozu influence. Most comments mention it. It's in the quiet family life between widowed father and his only daughter, in the dispassionate eye that gently embraces rhythms, in the lack of ego and hurt among the participants. He a train driver, attuned to a calm linear life that he controls, she a sociologist student, opening up to exploring and conceptualizing her ideas about things. This is all a great entry, Denis films warmth, equanimity, assurance in simply the presence of two people together. There's no dissatisfaction in the routine, no loneliness in the solitude. Denis has adopted Zen indirectly via cinematic Ozu, this character is not apparent in another of her films I've seen, which only affirms that she's open and agile in her work, refusing to settle.That's all fine in itself, I'll have this in my home over existential rumination every time, but Ozu is a bit more than tender tea in composed form. He begins with a rhythm that sets the spatiotemporal mechanism, and only after we have acquired presence does he introduce the dramatic event, usually a single one, usually marriage. The deeper thrust is that we'll go around that bend with more clarity than usual, registering transition in a cosmic way. A Japanese girl deciding on marriage was deciding on her future life after all; this needs to settle as deeply in us.This is all about cosmic transition, albeit in even softer strokes. A larger family has been introduced in between, another woman who has feelings for the widower, a boy who has feelings for the girl. They all live in the same building. There's a lovely spatial fabric that brings them together, for instance the boy coming up the stairs pauses in the hall and intently stares at the girl's door, the intensity is that he's not just looking at a piece of wood but through that, intently as if to part the image, into the space of a possible life beyond. So this isn't about just rhythm and composed space. It's about the neighbor woman smoking at her window hoping to see the man but not being sure this is it.It all comes together in a marvelous scene of dancing in a small neighborhood bar, a crank has been thrown in their concert plans for the evening, their car that breaks down, so life spontaneously resumes on the spot to figure itself out. The deeper thrust is that they all have to go on. The father has to let his daughter go, the girl has to move on from the family nest, the boy has to come to terms that he might have to move on alone, the neighbor woman move on without making her feelings known. A train colleague receives his pension as the film starts, he also has to move on but can't envision another life ahead; sure enough he's discovered near the end dead on the tracks by the father.The game with 35 shots is another entry; they do it, the father muses in a bar, to mark something that only happens once, life in a broader sense.The ending poses a conundrum. You'll probably have a sense of what Denis is trying to accomplish by that point. She has removed the one thing that significantly held Ozu back, explaining from the outside. So she's looking to embody the transition that is more than an event. Indirectly this brings her in line with every other filmmaker currently worth knowing in the attempt to create a new visual logic for becoming conscious. Denis is uniquely equipped in having seen Tarkovsky at work. So the film becomes muddled, crispness must go at that point. The whole idea is that they are both in the end still unsure about it, this is anchored in the nervous image of the boy in the hall. Did she do i"

WALL·E             ,WikusVanDeMerwe,0,animation,2008,10,"We live in a consumerist era. As any visit to a metropolitan area will prove, there is the unfaltering marriage of burgeoning commerce to a burgeoning population. Retail giants now provide services that would take more than a handful of independent stores to supply and this umbrella is continually widening. But how far can this consumerism go before it consumes us? This is where Wall-E begins, setting up the most scathing, yet perhaps most accurate futurist take on consumerism's affect on society in any animated film I've seen to date. In fact, I can't recall any film in the last several years that has taken this approach so seriously. Andrew Stanton once again throws us straight into a darkly themed film, but once again there are serious points to be had. At the outset of the film, we are introduced to a world where the skyscrapers that once housed the internal workings of business are dwarfed and surrounded by skyscrapers built of that very business' refuse. WALL-E spends his days continuously collecting and compacting the mountains of garbage that fill the streets of the city and adding it the trash skyscrapers, piece by piece. We learn very early on that this is the last functional bot of its kind, and perhaps, the only living machine on the planet. But there is something special about this surviving Wall-E; this robot performs its programmed tasks, but it has also become a curious being, collecting and organizing interesting items seen day by day. Wall-E is, essentially, the last bit of humanity left on Earth, since every other human being is either dead or living aboard the space cruise liner, the Axiom.But things change once EVE arrives on Earth. In true fashion with his curious nature, the sight of EVE is enthralling to Wall-E. Here is something new from humanity, not just the garbage and trinkets left behind for Wall-E to sift through and compact. What begins here is the most innocent yet basic of love stories I have seen or read in many years. There is a purity to Wall-E's almost hypnotic and naive interest in EVE. I don't mean this in any religious terms, but rather in the vein that neither robot has prior knowledge of love or adoration, apart from Wall-E's surviving betamax tape of Hello Dolly! as his primary source of inspiration. Everything else is rooted in simple curiosity, but it is amazing how far just that can develop one's character.Wall-E interacts with everything he finds in a very primal manner (the source of that curiosity), slowly learning about the things he finds by essentially playing with them until something happens. EVE is the dedicated but markedly emotional counterpart to Wall-E's primal self. She performs her tasks at the expense of taking notice of Wall-E. By the time she finally catches on to Wall-E's affection, the programmed side of herself sets off their exciting journey into space.Once things set into full-swing, this film does not let go of you. EVE and Wall-E are quite a dynamic duo, although not the romantic pair envisioned in Wall-E's mind for most of the film. I won't go into any further analysis here, lest I spoil the fun for anyone wishing to go see it. But I must say that the fact that we see two robots, two human creations, act as the primary humanizing force is entirely effective and what makes me love this film so much. The overall message of the film emerges from the dark outset and even darker conclusion... The ending credits are a must-view for anyone who sees the film. There is a very emotional sequence of progressions that twice put me to tears for its poignancy and in light of the beginning of the film. The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders.On other notes, the soundtrack is Newman's definitive work in cinema. I didn't think I would say this anytime post Finding Nemo, but it really is true. EVERY bit of music supports the film's imagery and tone while also helping shape it note by note. There is not a wasted note in this film.Also, the visual imagery is utterly beautiful and affecting. Skyscrapers of compacted garbage, the collections in Wall-E's trailer, the outer heavens, the POV's of EVE and Wall-E... All are fantastic. The cinematography is also top-notch. They might have used the back to foreground focus a bit much, but just the fact that they had Roger Deakins consult on their almost perfected simulation cinematography as well as Stanton's directorial 'mindprint' of the film speaks volumes for the studio. It is all found and spoken for in the final print.The thing about this movie is that is able to speak so much without much dialogue. Stanton has obviously learned a great deal in how to use the visual image as powerfully as possible.Verdict: Pixar gets another 10/10. They make films that speak to me in ways no other animation studio ever pulls off. The message may always be positive, but that doesn't mean the trials of Pixar characters are ever just plain and simple affairs. Stanton produced something very very special and endearing here. While the paint may be of a love story and two curious robots, he has captured nothing short of the core of our positive human nature in two inanimate objects. This is a meaningful and important film. How far can we let our lives be simplified before our own creations become more human than ourselves?"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,razmatazern,0,crime,2010,NA,"Terribly Happy entertained me throughout the whole film. From the peculiar characters to the peculiar town, I was interested in how this film would unwind. Like others have mentioned, the feel of the film reminded me of a Coen brothers movie, and certain parts of the movie were reminiscent of Fargo.The character of Robert was very intriguing. As I watched him trying to adapt in this little town, I wanted to know more about him. I wanted to know his back story and about his daughter. Fortunately, as the movie progresses, you learn bits and pieces of his character.The town is not just a simple small town where nothing happens, as suggested in the beginning of the film. The town is full of mystery, and it pretty much has it's own well-established government that controls everything that happens there.I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anybody that wants to watch an interesting and intriguing fil"
Stop-Loss             ,Lechuguilla,0,drama,2008,NA,"Well intentioned, this film tells the fictional story of Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), an American soldier who, after successfully completing a heroic but horrendous tour of duty in Iraq, is notified that, despite his wishes, he must return to Iraq for yet more combat duty, a real-life contingency called ""stop-loss"". It's a fate that neither King, nor real-life soldiers, want or deserve, but which the U.S. government justifies in lieu of a wartime draft.The film's first few minutes provide a montage of images and scenes showing King, and his men, in Iraq, as they bond together as protective buddies, and as they endure a violent urban ambush, during which several buddies get killed or seriously wounded.Back home in Texas, King and a couple of his men briefly celebrate their hero status. But life for them quickly deteriorates, as their wartime trauma leaves both physical and mental scars. And then, King gets his ""stop-loss"" notice. This sets up the rest of the film's plot.The theme here is obvious. The brave soldier, having endured more than enough danger and trauma, is still just a powerless individual. As such, he or she is caught between having to resubmit to the horrors of war, or submit to a perilous and life-altering AWOL status in the U.S., or elsewhere, forever on the run from an overpowering American political system. It's a timely and worthy subject for a film.That much effort and care went into the creation of the film, from background research to attention to detail in costumes, production design, and military protocol is obvious.And the film's color cinematography also is quite good. There are lots of close-ups, to get a feel for what the characters are going through. Many scenes feature natural lighting, used in clever ways. At times, the film has an almost documentary look and feel. Acting is overall credible. I especially liked the performances of Linda Emond, as King's mom, and Abbie Cornish, as a young woman who tries to help King.The major problem is the script. Characters are rather stereotyped and two-dimensional. The plot is fairly predictable. And the story and its attendant theme are a tad too direct. I could have wished for a little more depth, and a plot twist or two. The film's ending is not very satisfying.Yet, ""Stop-Loss"" is a noble effort to document the brutality not only of war but also of an American government that uses, then basically throws away, people, to ensure the preservation of an American war industry and continued power of faceless bureaucrats and corrupt politicians."
Quarantine             ,shamecorner,1,horror,2008,1,"This is probably the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was boring, and very poorly acted. It was more funny than anything. Also, it was very confussing. The camera is flying all over the place, so you can't really see what's going on. Then, a dog, that was suppose to be at a vet, randomly appears out of no where. The best part is a little infected girl, and the way she starts attacking. The whole threater cracked up laughing because it was so ridiculous. Another thing is that you lose interest 15 minutes into the movie when the main character stands outside the firehouse, doing nothing. Plus you already know the very predictable ending if you watch the trailer or even look at the movie poster. Absolutely awful, and I suggest no one waste their time ever watching this horrific movie."
Gran Torino             ,alexkolokotronis,0,drama,2009,9,"My expectations coming in to see Gran Torino were very high and it certainly did not disappoint. Of course Clint Eastwood reputation has only gotten even better since his recent success as a director but this time it his performance that leads the way.Clint Eastwood had if not the best performance, one of the best performances this year. His performance was vivid and magical to watch. Vivid may seem like a head scratcher of a word to use but his way of displaying his maliciousness, antisocial and cynical attitude to the many people around him including his family. Yet over the course of the movie his attitude changes towards a Hmong family who are his neighbors. When one of the boys (Thao) from the neighbors' attempts to rob him of his Gran Torino, the family sends him to work for Walt (Clint Eastwood) as punishment. While Thao works for Walt, Walt begins to form a protective fatherly type bond over Thao. In this way as well Eastwood's performance is very vivid showing how his cold bitter attitude can transform into a very warm selfless demeanor towards one family.Gran Torino was also written and directed very well. Especially since a relatively unknown cast played to beyond anyone could have expected. Some how Clint Eastwood manages to continue to maximize the potential of the material he is given.This was a very heart-warming film in my mind throughout. The ending of the film is probably more of an ending to Eastwood's career as an actor rather than that of the movie itself. It does not leave him in the place he is looked at as a vigilante but rather in the place of the man that stands up for his morals and for the people he is loyal to."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,ccthemovieman-1,0,drama,2009,8,"I found this to be an interesting film; certainly not boring as I had heard from a few people who saw it in the theater. To me, it was simply good storytelling.Yes, it's slow, especially by today's movie standards, but it's certainly a unique story and it's nicely filmed, acted and directed. Story-wise, it's one of those films I understand if people love it or hate it. I'm somewhat in the middle and leaning toward the positive.For a movie that runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes and is not some suspense or action film, it has to be pretty good to hold one's interest. I can only speak for myself; it held my interest for 95 percent of it.I think the first two-thirds of the movie is the best. Brad Pitt as ""Benjamin Button"" is pretty fascinating, as is the story of him growing up from a wrinkled, old man-baby to a mid-40s guy. When he re-unites with childhood friend ""Daisy"" (Cate Blanchett) and becomes her lover, the film bogs down in a few spots but few people are going to stop watching after investing two hours. It picks up again, especially in the last minutes when ""Benjamin"" begins to finally become younger than an adult.There's a sadness to this story, especially near the end but overall, even though it's central theme seems to be ""death,"" I don't think it's a depressing film. It does remind us, in a big way, that the longer we're around, the more death of friends and loved ones we witness. That's just a sad fact of life. I hear about it all time with my father, who is 91 years old and has seen almost all of his friends die.It's especially true in this story when Benjamin starts off and has a lot of old friends to begin with! ""Benjamin"" was an odd person to me; you could root for him, yet not admire him. He often treated people only to satisfy his desires and could have been so much more. Yet, being ""a fly on the wall"" and observing his interesting life, was memorable, making this a film worthy of the time invested to watch it.In the end, the movie made me appreciate the friends I do have, and not to take any of them for granted as life passes us by so fast, no matter what direction we're headed! "
Yes Man             ,saarvardi,0,comedy,2008,9,"Being a teenager in the 1990's, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey's mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey's rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.Over recent years, Carrey continued doing his thing, moving from comedy to dramatic roles and vice versa. The problem is that all of the sudden he wasn't alone in the ring anymore, and countless other comedians have tried to slip into his shoes to various degrees of success. There was no place to deny it; Carrey was in need of a hit to re-establish his place in the Hollywood sky.Cue the brand new comedy Yes Man, that finds Carrey once again in his favorite ""What if...?"" sub-genre. This time around, he plays Carl, a lonely divorcée that has somehow alienated even his best friend (portrayed successfully by Wedding Crasher's Bradley Cooper). Carl is stuck in a dead-end job at a bank, yearns for his ex-wife and spends his evenings watching rented DVDs... all by himself. When an old friend introduces him to a corny self-help program (lead by a hilarious Terrence Stamp) that persuades him to answer ""yes"" to every question thrown his way, Carl's life takes a dramatic turn.As expected, the new approach gets our hero into all kinds of wacky situations - such as spending a steamy morning with his horny elderly neighbor (!); meeting a potential Iranian wife through an online service; partying all night whilst drinking countless cans of Red-Bull and over excessively helping a homeless person. Luckily enough, it also introduces him to the extremely free-spirited Allison (portrayed by the ever-so-cute Zooey Dashnel).If you've seen the average Carrey comedy, you can probably guess how the plot unfolds from here on out, necessary complications included. The format is more or less the same of what we've been used to seeing Carrey perform in his comic outings, with the main idea being a modern moral story urging people to stop going through the motions of life and start seizing the day. But I digress. It seems as though years of perfecting his comic roles as well as starring in more ""grown up"" roles have tamed Carrey a bit. A lot of the arrogance and awkwardness revolving his earlier films seem to be missing this time out, and instead I could actually feel true emotion and heart in Yes Man. It seems as if this fact alone contributed greatly to the fact that most of the punch lines actually worked here and I found myself smiling for the larger part of the film.Some points that still managed to ruin some of the fun are: A. As mentioned above, the film was very predictable, and formulated at that. B. Carrey has definitely aged recently, and it's starting to show. The age gap between him and Dashnel left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable.However, all in all I had a great time with some excellent laughs - and at the end of the day that's what really counts (: 1"
Ghost Town             ,maureenmcqueen,0,misc,2008,8,"A true delight. Ghost Town is David Koepp's most original script since Death Becomes Her and Death Becomes Her is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Daring, hilarious and elegant. Ghost Town is set in a more recognizable world, recognizable from many different angles, at times it feels we've seen all this before but what sets it apart is its heart. There is real heart here and a real intention. Ricky Gervais is fantastic as the ""no people person"" his unlikeable persona becomes the most likable aspect of the movie. I was taken by Gervais's predicament and I was never allowed to slip away. I was entertained and delighted throughout. 8/10 1"
Garden Party             ,jfwong,1,drama,2008,NA,"I liked Crash. I thought the interweaving story lines was subtle enough to not make me second guess any of the writing. The issues dealing with race and class differences was very compelling and brought me to a different level when I left the movie theater.I do not like Garden Party. Here we have yet another film about people living or moving to LA to try and follow their dreams. The problem with stories like this is the subject matter itself. The film has a smart premise, but I simply did not care for any of the characters.That being said, Garden Party is not a total failure. While the story lines that do join together are forced and many times just don't feel genuine in the least bit. But we do have small scenes of character interactions that are quirky, funny, and charming.The movie portrays LA a little differently than people see it as on the outside. Unfortunately for LA, the more real perception of the city isn't very pretty. And when a movie comes along trying to push that specific point, it better do it with some characters we want to care about.In the end, Garden Party is the story of how we struggle to live our lives, and how not everything is golden and happy on the outside. You might connect with some of the terribly stereotyped characters, but in truth the writing doesn't lend itself to a strong character development, the acting as a whole is sub par, and the story simply not believable. I didn't buy into it, but you might."
21             ,valenti2-1,0,crime,2008,4,Unless your in the mood for a extremely predictable movie that can be watched mindlessly this is not the movie for you. It consists of watching endless amounts of hands of blackjack which is the most boring card game probably to watch ( I play poker so I am probably biased but I wasn't the only one who said this of the people I was with.) I also found the main character to be annoying with just how awkward he was I dislike all characters in movies who are awkward this always disturbs more than mild violence because I probably can relate to it better. i felt the main character tried way to hard to achieve this role if your looking for a gambling movie definitely just re-watch the classic Rounder
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,alexmccourt,0,misc,2009,9,"I want to see this again, to help me decide if it really was as good as I thought it was the first time round. Whod've thought that a film about a seemingly unprepossessing little Italian politician, Giulio Andreotti, could be so damn entertaining.The movie revolves around how extraordinary this man was. However, the mystery - did he or didn't he arrange all those assassinations, was he or wasn't he involved with those nasty Mafia people - was the main driver for the story. A film's plot is always the main enjoyment for me - which is why I detest those smartass reviewers who think it's OK to give the game away - and this one got a big leg up from the true -life storyline. The answer to the mystery is probably given in one seconds-long soundbite somewhere near the end of the film. I say probably because Mr Andreotti spends a fair bit of time in solo self justification and I was never sure if any of his monologues had elements of truth in them.As a piece of film making, this movie is dark, elegant and strange, as befits the subject matter. The acting performances are excellent, particularly Tony Servillo as the said Mr Andreotti. Overall, splendido."
Mamma Mia!             ,Chris_Docker,1,comedy,2008,7,"Mamma Mia! Does the mention of anything Abba-ish send you cringing to a corner? Or are you already joining in and dancing on the tabletops? Maybe another few drinks . . .In short, if you are not allergic to Abba, book your tickets now. If you are, why would you be reading this? At a pinch, it is worth seeing for Meryl Streep alone, who not only throws herself headlong into every refrain with unashamed gusto, but adds a touch of class and nuance to what otherwise could be a one-dimensional adaptation. Streep vacillates engagingly between playing herself and not taking herself too seriously. Pierce Brosnan just about keeps up, and manages more expressions than he ever did as James Bond. Colin Firth and Julie Waters trail behind somewhat. Yet Mama Mia! is a roller coaster of emotion, careering colourfully from the blue waters of the Adriatic, bursting 'like Aphrodite's Fountain' into the lives of Donna (Meryl) , her lovers and friends, and her soon-to-be-wed daughter. It is the party spirit that says kick your shoes off and sing silly cheesy songs. Altogether now.And yes <U+0096> there's a story. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married. To the buff-looking Sky. Only <U+0096> where's her dad? She's never met him. A sneak-peek at Mom's diary shows Mom had three lovers before Sophie was born and Sophie secretly invites all of them. This is a film of threesomes. Three past lovers (Sam, Bill and Harry). Three close friends (Donna and two best pals). And, not to be outdone, Sophie meets up with two other young girls at the start of the film.The breakneck pace still allows for brilliantly put together shots. Like Streep doing a 'Titanic' with drapes blowing in the wind. Or a pier-load of young hunky stag night crew doing a dance in trunks and deep-dive flippers. Moonlit boats and beaches to ""I Have a Dream."" Filmed on location, the views won't disappoint. And like a favourite song whose ending we know, the drama is in the details and execution.As with many adapted-from-stage musicals, two young leads are played by talented singers, and the older parts by serious actors can sing well enough. Streep manages extremely well. Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. Fortunately, it is perhaps easy to paper over any cracks in musical comedy. Sweeney Todd relied heavily on Depp's charisma and stunning cinematography. Across the Universe, too heavily on the songs. Mamma Mia!, on the other hand, simply tailors everything to its joyous headlong rush. The songs fit naturally to the action. Streep even manages to sing them with her tongue firmly in cheek. She confesses to having been a ""stupid reckless little slut"" but then says she ""grew up"". (To which her pals chime in, ""Well grow back down again!"") The film is not without faults. There is a notable lack of chemistry between the people that throw themselves rapturously against each others' faces. Even Streep looks less than convincing in a brief lips-mash. And the men are a bit croaky in the singing department (Hugh Grant might even have been a preferable casting choice). And some of the time-line is wobbly. For instance, strange as it may seem, music from more than twenty years ago does not all come from the same era. So reminiscing about flower power (early sixties) in the same breath as a Johnny Rotten t-shirt (Sex Pistols, mid-late seventies) is either anachronistic or wishful thinking.Sadly, I am of a generation that can remember Abba-mania. The records would shoot to number one. Yet even then few people would admit to buying them. I used to manage a night club, and Abba was great music to ask a girl up to dance. My entire chat-up repertoire at that time consisted of, ""Would you like to dance?"" and ""Do you want to come back for a coffee?"" But girls would be so happy dancing to Mamma Mia they'd say yes anyway. I'd fall in love with a new girl each week. Ah, those were the days! Now there's a new generation of Abba fans who have no need to 'come out of a closet'. Abba is retro-chique. Even Madonna segued an Abba riff into one of her songs. From karaoke to hen nights. From '70s' nights to gay dance-floors. Dress up. Camp it up. Sing it up. Get sassy and cheesy. Or, if you're old enough to remember, fly back in time to wonderful memories.Mamma Mia!, whatever detractors might say, has been one of the most successful stage shows of recent times. Supported by the same director and original band members, the movie may well reach the similar fan bases. Or just the party spirit in all of us. 2"
Hancock             ,nolarobert,0,action,2008,8,"I caught a preview showing of Hancock tonight. I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" and those who enjoy Will Smith. 1"
The Brothers Bloom             ,loneduck,1,action,2008,7,"Like Brick, much of Rian Johnson's new film The Brothers Bloom is filled with crackerjack storytelling, snappy dialogue, and extraordinary visual panache. Unlike Brick, most of these arts are devoted to making us laugh, and the first 1/2 to 2/3rds of the movie are very funny indeed, and well worth seeing.But there's an ambiguity established while we're enjoying ourselves: is this movie fundamentally about the Brothers Bloom, or about their last con, an eccentric, beautiful young heiress named Penelope Stamp? Sure, the movie is named for the Brothers, but not only was the script originally titled Penelope, Penelope's quirky character also still brims with so much mystery and potential for surprise in the finished film that one can't help but wonder if the resolution of her character's journey won't place the spotlight firmly on her.Alas, it does not. Somewhere between Act IV and Act V, the focus shifts firmly back to Stephen and Bloom, leaving at least one major mystery about Penelope (how she talks herself out of a major jam in Prague) unresolved.Not that Penelope is the only one with major mysteries left unresolved. I would've liked to have known why two brothers named Stephen and Bloom were collectively referred to as the Brothers Bloom. Does that mean Bloom's full name is Bloom Bloom? Given that another character's name is Bang Bang, I suppose it's not beyond consideration.In the final analysis, though I definitely wanted to know more about the resolution of the Prague caper, movies can use more, not less unresolved mystery. But what's unavoidably disappointing about the finish of the Brothers Bloom is the feeling of lost potential as Penelope is pushed off center stage and relegated to a supporting role for the last part of the movie.Stephen says a couple of times that everyone gets what they want in the perfect con, but this con didn't give me what I wanted.All that said, I'll still be lining up for tickets ASAP when Johnson's next film comes out."
Flash of Genius             ,bob the moo,0,misc,2009,NA,"OK, so, on paper you must confess that any film that dramatises anything involving windscreen-wipers runs the risk of being pretty darn dull. But then at the same time maybe it is one of those films that sounds dull but is actually thrilling by way of drawing the viewer into the subject. When you thing about it, ignoring the part of the car that it involves, this story of the little man put down by a heartless corporation is pretty well timed with the strength of feeling towards our economic ruling class nowadays. So maybe Flash of Genius could ride that wave and deliver an impacting and uplifting story of overcoming at the same time <U+0096> full of tension and emotion. Well, yes, I guess it ""could"" but the question is ""does it?""Unfortunately the answer to that is ""no"" and at best the film could be described as ""solid"". Contrary to my preconception the film is not dull because of the subject or because it gives lots of detail on engineering but rather because it seems to drag everything out and offer the viewer very little reason to care. It doesn't appear to focus on forward motion because if there is an opportunity to go over old ground or get into a rut then you best believe that it takes it. It is not a grind though, don't get me wrong, it is not a bad film, but just one that seems happy to do very little other than the basics. The courtroom scenes are where it should have come to life but even these fail to thrill or engage <U+0096> OK they are there and they are ""fine"" for what they are but how am I the viewer supposed to be excited by what I am watching if the film itself seems all very underwhelmed by it.I won't say that the cast are the problem but they are certainly part of it. Kinnear tries to deliver the character with real emotion in a way that will draw sympathy from the audience but his drab performance and repetitive delivery is part of the film being slowed down and not allowed to fizz. Graham doesn't help because she is part of this aspect of his character. In fairness she is quite lively and real but she cannot lift the film when the rest of it seems so intent on being average and sluggish. Alda turns up to offer the viewer hope as he enters the film with his custom delivery and energy, having several good scenes before disappearing again. Pileggi is a good solid ""baddie"" in the corporate sense and perhaps it would have helped to have allowed him more room to play with his character. Sadly none of the cast really gets to do this other than Kinnear, who has to take his scenes down into ""despair"" in a way that deadens the film and robs it of pace. Perhaps this is an accurate telling of the story but in this case it comes at a price and that price is the film's effectiveness and entertainment value.This leaves Flash of Genius as a film that is far too worthy for its own good. It plays like a solid TVM and it certainly offered me nothing to justify why it was in the cinema with me when at best it was a DVD release. It has little in the way of drama or tension to it and it is hard to emotionally buy into the film in the way I needed to be able to in order to stick with it. If ""solid"" is what you are after then this is an OK film but the only remarkable thing about it is just how unremarkable, sluggish and frankly dull the whole thing is."
Wendy and Lucy             ,Klickberg,1,drama,2008,10,"Far more refreshing to see the first and perhaps only truly flawless film of 2008 is the fact that Wendy and Lucy may be one of the first pieces of American contemporary art to both attempt to and succeed at encapsulating the entire human experience, particularly during our current universal financial and cultural malaise.I was particularly impressed to see a female writer/director--an American female, at that--who so deftly crafted a film with no rough edges, an efficient and earnest work that suffered none from any kind of artificial maudlin sentimentality.From moment one, it is clear that Ms. Reichardt has paid well-deserved attention to the works of Gus Van Sant (and in fact she gives thanks to Van Sant's genius cinematographer, Harris Savides, responsible for the ambrosial Death Trilogy). But too has this vibrant and adept filmmaker paid great notice to the neo-realists of yesteryear, particularly De Sica (the entire film can almost be seen as a contemporized Umberto D.).It is thus both for the content and form alike that Wendy and Lucy is indeed an imperative film in today's society, one that I hope will have a lasting shelf life and will allow Ms. Reichardt to continue doing what she clearly does best.Bravo.(Also, I've decided to add this short digression in here, as I'm saddened--though not surprised--by a great deal of the antipathy being dumped upon this fine American minimalist film. I've seen many reviews castigate Wendy and Lucy for being a film ""without enough depth or background,"" with characters whose plights are far too ""simplistic,"" or for simply being too nihilistic and bleak in its outlook of our current times. It is because Ms. Reichardt has decided to cast away the prototypical shackles of American films and to give us an earnest story with characters plucked directly from today's quotidian struggles that she, and her entire crew, should be applauded. Reichardt's unique choice of creating a film of empathy is unique, as, more and more, our American filmmakers choose to make films of sympathy: films that tell you too much, that give you all of the answers, and that break away from any semblance of truth or universality.Fortunately for those who had difficulty sitting still through a quiet, unassuming film such as Wendy and Lucy, there is more than enough television on the airwaves these days to satisfy. And fortunately, for the rest of us, those who are actually going through the very struggles that Wendy endures or who at least have any kind of awareness of these struggles, there is this brilliant and vital film.)"
The Burning Plain             ,antoniotierno,1,misc,2008,7,"Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, the one of ""21 Grams"", employs a very peculiar narrative style to tell stories of different characters, Charlize Theron's Sylvia, Jennifer Lawrence's Marina, and Kim Basinger's Gina. At first everything seems a bit messy (various threads seemingly insignificant) but then the plot gets poignant though a little oppressive. Acting performances are affecting and strong (especially Charlize Theron), the tone is progressively melodramatic. It's undeniable that The Burning Plain possesses the style of a strong drama, never run-of-the-mill and with an emotional resonance resembling 21 Grams. Overall a very good sad film, with a finale that strikes a lot."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,johno-21,0,crime,2009,NA,"I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. from writer/director Henrik Ruben Genze based on the novel by Erling Jepsen is a dark and quirky crime story set in a small rural Danish village where everybody knows everything about everyone and they live and die by their own unique code of justice. Robert (Jakob Cedergren) is a cop from the city who has been reassigned as the town marshall because of a mental breakdown he suffered and he has to stay in the demotion until he can work his way back onto the force back in the the city. He immediately discovers the odd and unwelcome clannish ways of border town community and meets Ingerlise (Lena Maria Christiansen), the abused wife of the town bully Jorgen (Kim Bodnia). This is a psychological thriller with suspense and dark comedy woven together in a story that is almost Stephen King-like. The moody cinematography from Jorgen Johansson is excellent and the film moves at a slow pace but never drags down and keeps your interest throughout. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it."
Adoration             ,MetalAngel,0,drama,2010,7,"Atom Egoyan's latest feat, ""Adoration"", features among Egoyan's most profound work, and it is also one of the best independent or underground films you can rent this year. Now, you might be wondering how I can call a film by Atom Egoyan 'underground', when he's one of the most renowned directors in the world. It's precisely the same question I asked a fellow critic of mine who recommended it, and now that I've seen it, I have the answer: It features a large cast of 'unknowns' (with the possible exception of Scott Speedman), a large crew of unknowns, it features a small budget, it's artsy...but most of all, it aspires and tries to be overwhelming at its impact and appealing to the masses, and it fails to be either at the end. Not even the seal of recognition from the Cannes Film Festival in 2008 saved this film from being on a short release during the winter of 2009 and from finally emerging on DVD, at the end of the same year.But please, bear with me. The film deals with a teenager called Simon (Devon Bostick) who's written a fictional monologue where his father left his pregnant mother on a plane and hid a bomb on her carry-on bag, which is discovered by the authorities and which foils his plans of terrorism. Prompted by Sabine, his French teacher (Arsinée Khanjian), he makes his classmates believe the story is true, and publishes it on an Internet chat room which makes thousands of bloggers go crazy on the subjects of terrorism, victims, love, recognition, the value of life, etc...all of that, prompted by his story. Simon is scared to find out how much of his fictional story is true, since for some reason it has a familiar ring with some images of his past. So he decides to make a video diary where he films the bloggers who heatedly comment on his story, and who provide him with the necessary 'mind fuel' to deduct whether his father actually WAS an assassin, whether his mother was his victim, whether his grandfather (Kenneth Welsh) polluted their memory and whether his uncle (Scott Speedman) is hiding something.I know, it sounds like a complicated storyline...and it is. There are infinite separate plots (each character has ulterior motives, an agenda, and a haunting past which establishes their present personalities), and the film is given to us in puzzle pieces, with the separate scenes jumping from present, to future to past...to imaginary present, future and past...all of this to a point where you won't understand a thing you see on screen if you're not fully concentrated. I was, thankfully, and I found it easy to keep up with so many plot lines, and as the film progressed and I discovered more details and secrets every second, I felt my heart pounding and my palms sweating from the tension and the heavy drama on screen. THAT'S where the film is genius; on the way it uses an intelligent and complicated plot perfectly, and on how it reaches over to the audience.The film IS good, it is very very good, actually, but it tries to exceed its own potential, giving way to a large amount of unfinished plot twists, undeveloped characters and confusing situations. Stories begin to fit in together, resolutions are being taken, and by the end of the film the principal characters have all found catharsis in their own way...but what about the infinite number of other characters the film presents? They're all left behind, with no completion whatsoever. SO many topics that were effectively handled and most of them weren't developed! The main characters (Simon, the French teacher, the uncle, the grandfather and the parents) have incredible depth, and halfway through the film you're convinced that this might just be THE deepest and most intelligent film of the decade...but soon after that, the film is over and only the superficial plot lines where resolved, only the surface of the characters came full circle. It's one of those movies where the credits start rolling and you say ""It's over?! But what about the..."", then you start making so any questions, and you start coming up with so many answers, all of them giving birth to more questions...until you have no idea what you're even coming up with.Perhaps this was Egoyan's point, to keep us thinking and thinking until our thoughts seem to have detached from the film itself; it's a good thing to do- to have your public ponder so much- but it's bad when it affects the movie. Like I said, it tries to overreach, it goes literally everywhere with so much plot that OBVIOUSLY there are going to be mistakes and plot lines will be left unsolved. But even through these flaws, the film delivers interesting messages, it gives us a couple of memorable characters and a story (however complicated it may be) that entertains and envelops the viewer. And even if the balance of the film slowly shattered at the end, for most of the duration it was maintained, giving the viewer a very rewarding hour and forty minutes of viewing experience.If you love artsy, independent films- see it. If you're tired of mainstream Hollywood brainless flicks and want something new- see it. If you love Atom Egoyan or are planning to introduce him into your cinema knowledge- see it. If you're expecting to see a paramount in independent cinema that transcends our expectations on the seventh art- skip it. This is very good, but not great.

Wendy and Lucy             ,bob the moo,1,drama,2009,NA,"Wendy is travelling across America to get to Alaska where she hears that there are more jobs than people. When her car breaks down in a small town, she and her dog Lucy are stranded with dwindling resources and increasing demands on them. Attempting to shoplift some food sees Wendy spend the afternoon in the local police department and, when released, Lucy is nowhere to be found. With her car needing expensive work and nowhere to stay, Wendy is forced to try and find Lucy before she can continue to journey, or rather ""if"" she can continue her journey.I wanted to really like this film for many reasons. As an indie sleeper hit and a very minimalist film the intellectual side of me wants to find meaning in it so that I can be one of the ones that ""get it"" and somehow be above those that do not. I'm being honest about this and I think many might have the same motivation whether they know it or not. I pushed this down before watching but the film itself really helped me to do this because there is little of real value here for me to get excited about. It is not that the film is slow and silent (80 minutes feels a lot longer) although I can see why this would bother some users and it is not the lack of ""events"" either because I can cope with that. No, what got me was that the film seemed to have very little to say. I was looking for it to be intelligent and subtle, using Wendy's predicament to say something about life and, although it does, it is hardly worth listening to and it doesn't spread its message across the whole film. So mostly what we get is Wendy wandering around the place with little being done either in terms of ""actions"" or ""subtext"".Trust me, I was looking for it to say something about those on the edge of society, those forced to make tough emotional decisions for financial reasons but it just didn't. Plenty of people have found it to do just that and have found a lot of meaning in the film and I am really glad that they did <U+0096> and a little jealous that I did not, but I didn't and there is nothing I can do about that. Williams is good in the film but she is working with very little and it is an indie-film cliché to suggest that the lack of substance is substance. That the film emotionally engages at all is down to her presence. Patton is OK but mostly just supporting the film with his presence while Dalton is a kindly presence.Wendy and Lucy is a minimalist indie film that some will find has beauty and insight in the silence and the detail but for me personally I found it to be far too light in meaning to justify the running time <U+0096> which is a pretty damming thing to say about a film that barely hits 80 minutes. Williams is good and the potential is there but it is not insightful, meaningful or engaging enough to achieve what it sets out to do."
I Sell the Dead             ,the_hurricane15,,misc,2008,9,"I went to see Glenn McQuaid's ""I Sell The Dead"" in it's North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Seeing as this is the second showing worldwide I didn't quite know what to expect of this film, especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation.I'll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis, without giving away any spoilers.This movie is about Arthur Blake, how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered.The costume and set design in this film were excellent. I was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate to the time, really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time. This movie works just as well as a period-piece as it does a horror-comedy.The interaction between the two leads was very fluid. They played off each others acting with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, with Glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations.The story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start. I'd compare it to a visual page turner, always wondering just what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself.All in all, I recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour, with a bit of horror mixed in.9/10"
WALL·E             ,CA_movie_fan,0,animation,2008,10,"We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it's ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level. Bravo! 6"
Four Christmases             ,Otoboke,1,comedy,2008,NA,"Ah the Christmas movie, is there anything more fitting and resembling of its subject matter when it comes to big screen adaptations? Much like the holiday season itself however, one can't assume absolute objectivity; Christmas is undoubtedly a holiday that is about family, joy and celebration and yet there are hordes of people who anticipate the ringing on sleigh bells with about as much excitement as a turkey waiting to be put into an oven. Four Christmases surprisingly accommodates this somewhat polarising aspect of the holiday during its initial stages, but then promptly spirals into cliché storytelling for the sake of proving a warm and fuzzy ending to melt the bitter snow in our hearts. What's most surprising however is that the movie's sugary latter half actually works a whole lot better than its former, as director Seth Gordon never quite hits the ball on his intended edgy comedy routines. In the end what you end up with is something akin to a dangerously half-cooked turkey dinner that has its moments and yet fails to satisfy because of the amount of picking you have to do. It's standard Christmas-time affair that will be sure to mildly please those who are into such a thing, but for the rest of us, it's just another thing on the list to avoid.The name of the game this time around is, yes, you guessed it; family. Well, that, and dysfunction (of course). Four Christmases, a movie about finding out about the real joys of life <U+0096>which resolve to be not exotic holidays or gifts, but real, honest companionship- never goes anywhere new with what it has to say; if you've seen any number of cookie-cutter Christmas movies, you've pretty much seen this. To its advantage and at times disadvantage, the script penned by a whole array of writers I'm not even going to bother listing does broaden its horizons with comedy that stays true to the sub genre's a-typical formula but branches off with a little more risqué material. As to whether or not the risks reap any rewards is something of a mixed bag; there are moments when Four Christmases is genuinely funny, and the performances do well to get this across, but with far too many misses and an overwhelming lack of such instances, the movie certainly isn't going to have you out of your seat. That of course doesn't mean that there isn't fun to be had here, because there is; this is a feature that is bound to lightly amuse more than cause a ruckus of laughter, and for that there is a certain amount of praise warranted.Where Four Christmases slips up quite often though lies in the tepid romance that is supposed to be getting some analytical treatment here. The story of Brad and Kate is not a new one; madly in love for three years, the two have been sharing a life of luxury together for a long time now, and yet never really got to know each other in the process. The movie opens with a rather striking sequence that even shows the two role-playing in public as cooked up personas, which is interesting considering how little time they have spent getting to know each other. Of course, this is an interesting premise, but little is done to capitalise on it script wise. When it comes to the performances of Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, the dynamism and chemistry is just as rigid and dead; there is no believable spark present and no genuine moments of heart-warming romance. In fact, the most believable moments that occur between Vaughn and Witherspoon is when they are at odds with each other; again this plays into the movie's much more engaging comedic edge, but does little to pad out the silliness. On their own, the two thespians provide great performances respectively, but brought together there's an imbalance that never quite allows either of them to connect.If there's one thing that the movie does get right however, it's conveying the frantic chaos inherent to the holiday, especially when it comes to family celebrations and get-togethers. Of course it's standard fare that has been done countless other times in far greater features, but in amongst the many problems that Four Christmases suffers from, such moments of awkward and often slapstick family confrontations fulfil their purpose of tickling the audience far greater than any of the other lacking elements. For a Christmas movie, it's not bad, but it's not great either; throwing in sporadic comedy and fun with lukewarm romance and lazy plotting, Four Christmases isn't anything new for holiday movie lovers to soak up, but it certainly isn't anything to loose any sleep over either. Instead it simply exists as a throw away for a couple of hours of silly entertainment to lighten the spirits; it may not do its job coherently, but it does so enough to satisfy those that target such affairs.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,goldwriting,1,misc,2008,7,"The next chapter in the tale of the denim divas follows them to all corners of the earth, but separately. Each of the girls leaves for the summer to follow their own path, their own heart and where it takes them is not always right along side each other. One goes to drama camp to find out her place in the theater might not be behind the curtains at all, while another goes to art school only to find drawing passion and heart can't be done when the artist has closed hers off. One more girl learns the past is only as far your last conversation with someone you care about, while lastly another finds looking into the future is more frightening when you imagine it alone. Each young woman travels their own road and this story is how they find themselves and each other once again along the way.After reading all that it might feel like The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 has stuffed way too much into those wildly decorated jeans, but the movie shows itself to be a great example of intelligent and accomplished editing. Each storyline is touched on, taken in and then moved on from with impeccable timing, never overstaying its welcome and never leaving the audience wondering what was going on with the rest of the girls. Everyone is granted a wealth of screen time and that passes on to the viewer a level of visual respect, so we can decide for ourselves which person we want to route for (if not all of them, which in my case, it wasn't, but I'll get to that later). Credit is assuredly given to the director, Sanaa Hamri, for her work, but I want to lend a special round of digital applause to the editor, Melissa Kent, for really keeping a well balanced performance intact for everyone involved.About those performances, let's take a closer look at the set up and how it differs from the first time these pants made their appearance on the silver screen. We have four young up-and-coming actresses in Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn and America Ferrera. When the first movie came out Alexis was riding high on the back of Gilmore Girls mania, while Amber had recently enjoyed critical acclaim in her starring turn on Joan of Arcadia (although not the public rating support that usually accompanies such high reviews). This time around, Alexis and Amber have taken a back seat to the Emmy and Golden Globe winning America Ferrera from the critic's wonder darling, Ugly Betty and the hype/buzz machine powerhouse of Blake Lively and her adolescent hormone extravaganza, Gossip Girl. Behind the scenes the dynamic may have changed, but on screen you would never know how far things had shifted. There is a palpable level of camaraderie between these four young girls, but how far that lasts when the cameras are off is hard to tell. Personally, the two current headliners, Blake and America, stole the show with their respective performances, especially Blake, while Alexis held her own and Amber fell a little flat. Part of Amber's problem is she has the character with the least reason to support her. For most of the movie she is grumpy, frumpy and bordering on goth. While each of the other girls are stretching and reaching out, Amber's character is retreating inward, causing a slight disconnect with the rest of the pack. On the other side of the gender line, there are the men in the picture. No teen chick flick is complete without the heartthrob young men to make the girls swoon, but in most stories there are also the jerks and brutish young punks who hurt or disappoint the girls first, which sends them running to the male best friend who they never looked at in that way before, but they see, and so on and so on. In this story I felt a little break in that belief in the world it created because every guy in the film was perfect. They were all total gentlemen, caring, sensitive, bursting with charm, and to top it all off most of them looked they had just walked out of the gym after a 24-hour work out bender (all except for Blake's dad, which can be excused in this case). The only reason this stood out as a problem for me was they had every guy throwing themselves at their feet, so their only real problem was with themselves, and that makes for very few hurdles to jump over which are not self-imposed.In the end the movie is enjoyable and the people in the crowd I was a part of all had their share of cheering moments. It's a chick flick in its purest form, but that doesn't mean all the boyfriends and best friends out there have to moan and groan when they get dragged to it. The theater experience really doesn't bring anything special to it, so you guys out there might even be safe until DVD release, but once that comes, you better find yourself a comfy pillow on the couch because you can be sure this will get heavy rotation.p.s. My friend would be remiss if I didn't mention her issue with the casting of the male model character in Alexis Bledel's story arc. Not a bad actor at all, but she got the vibe he (or his character) wasn't really into Alexis, or her character, or her gender<U+0085> Oh SNAP! And I would be remiss not to mention that since this is a sequel with no sub-title it will forever be known to me as The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2: Electic Boogaloo."
The Burning Plain             ,secondtake,1,misc,2010,7,"The Burning Plain (2008)Following a growing trend toward taking a straight forward story and making it complicated by telling it out of order, The Burning Plain might have shown the fault lines in that method. And it's not that the story, a kind of Romeo and Juliet with child story, isn't riveting. It is. And it's not that the telling of it isn't interesting. It is. But the telling is so forcefully complicated, it draws attention to itself, and away from the more human drama that is at work.That said, it's also true that every high point here there is a storytelling gaffe. The cross cultural Mexican/American themes are generally underplayed (the exception being the insults thrown at the funeral), and convincing. The basic love story is strong enough, too, and given a nice second layer through time, as you'll see. But there are some quirks that are made both improbable and overly dramatic. One of the tenderhearted heros of the story is shown too visibly as a disturbed stalker. And the lead woman, played with a kind of virtuosic exuberance as usual by Charlize Theron, has almost too much to juggle, emotionally and literally. It just doesn't wash.Most troubling is the writing. Not the big picture, the plot and the large sequence of events, but the actually dialog. This kind of gritty and dire movie laced with real love has to be convincing above all, and there are dozens of moments and individual lines that just smack as screen writing rather than real characters thinking and speaking.So it's a mixed bag. An ambitious and promising mixed bag, with some moving and beautiful moments. I think it's worth seeing, but with tolerance."
Sex and the City             ,loufalce,1,comedy,2008,1,"Yet another TV show {yawn} becomes a film. A gaggle of successful late thirty something women bitch, moan, and in general treat men like dirt as they wear designer clothes, try on shoes, live in overpriced apartment in gentrified neighborhoods,, advance their careers, attend fashion shows , go shopping ,and in general do the same thing they did in the late-and unlamented series. This disaster is overlong- 2 and a half hours- and, believe me it IS a chore to sit through. For die-hard fans only. The kind of movie that men get dragged to, and have to admit they liked to please their dates. It gives ""chick flicks"" their bad name. You've seen it all before-and better too. At least the girls are good to look at{and fantasize about} and provide decent eye candy, but thats about it.Now don't get me wrong. I can enjoy a well made and well acted ""woman's film"" just as much as the next guy, but this one just ain't it.If all this is not bad enough, there are more product placements in this film then you can shake a stick at.

Hancock             ,The_Defiant1,0,action,2008,9,"Perhaps I'm being generous, but I think this movie deserves some credit. It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the ""Powers That Be"" comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the ""Shadow State"" comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.Will Smith and Charlize Theron do a great job. The hero is flawed, but he's not a wimp. The movie's biggest weakness is the pacing. Some of the special effects go by so fast that you don't get to appreciate them. Some of the drama plays out so slowly that you might be wondering why they don't rush it along. The movie is faithful to the trailer. It's tough writing a spoiler-free review of this since there are some great twists in the plot. 1"
Yes Man             ,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,0,comedy,2009,6,"The premise is good: that kind of sectarian gregariousness that turns people into a brainwashed flock, only to scream ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" at a ridiculous guru's finger-snapping - and its impact over one's life.AND, for almost one third of the movie, the humor works well; Carrey is his old self (old - also in the negative sense: again, again, AGAIN the same grimaces!), but at least we guffaw in laughter often enough.Unfortunately, around half-ways, the script turns messy, dissociated, incoherent... it departs the efficient logic that had led it till then. And the fun gets repetitive and ever more tired...In the end, it leaves us with the fateful question: ""And so, what...?"" But, at least, it is some comedy... Mediocre, but still amusing... Not as the tons of trash that the Hollywood showbiz delivers all year long, under the Apatow and Seltzer signature. Thank God for the small favors - and small time comedies! "
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,Buddy-51,0,animation,2008,4,"High on the list of movies-we-probably-could-have-done-without would be ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" an animated installment in the sci-fi series that serves mainly as the big-screen warm-up act for the upcoming TV series of the same name. Since it falls somewhere between ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" in the narrative sequence (think of it as Episode 2 ½ ), virtually none of the really interesting characters in the saga make an appearance in this movie - no Luke Skywalker, no Han Solo, no Princess Leia, no Darth Vader. Instead, we're left with a young pre-Vader Anakin Skywalker and a pre-Alec Guinness Obi-wan Kenobi off on a mission to rescue the son of Jaba the Hutt, who's been kidnapped by the Empire's evil Count Dooku in a convoluted scheme to turn the Hutts against the Republic, thereby denying them use of the trading routes that the Hutts control.Considering the fact that the last time we saw Anakin he had already completed his journey to the Dark Side and taken on the mantle of Darth Vader, it seems a trifle incongruous to still be cheering him on as a hero in this film. It also doesn't help that, in animated form, Anakin (voiced by Matt Lanter) is an even more shallow and wooden character than he was in the first two episodes of the series, and that the playful bantering between him and his sassy, Jedi-in-training sidekick, Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Drane), is a pale echo indeed of the kind of verbal jousting that Han and Leia regularly engaged in in those earlier films. And what's with turning Jaba the Hut's uncle into a purple, painted-up drag queen with the vocal stylings and facial expressions of Truman Capote? On a technical level, the animation is no more than passable even in its best moments, with the backdrops and special effects far less impressive than they are in the live-action episodes - or in any Pixar movie released in the past ten years for that matter. The fight scenes are relatively fast-paced, but they do go on and on to the point where, after awhile, the audience is just passively staring at things occurring on the screen, not becoming actively engaged in any kind of character conflict or compelling storyline.""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" feels like a cynical, on-the-cheap attempt to bilk still more money out of the legions of die-hard ""Star Wars"" fans who have been so instrumental in helping George Lucas build a pretty impressive empire of his own. And those devotees certainly deserve something better than this halfhearted, intergalactic version of ""Adventures in Babysitting."" Don't get me wrong, I love ""Star Wars"" as much as the next person, but ""The Clone Wars"" is unworthy of the Lucasfilm trademark. 1"
Wendy and Lucy             ,anjru,1,drama,2009,8,"To say that this film is spare is to be generous; and, to whatever extent actors become their characters, Michelle Williams becomes Wendy, a young woman that is hanging by a thread. Wendy is doing her best, with little support and money, to survive day to day and to maintain her dignity. Along the way she loses her dog Lucy, the only stable and loving relationship in her life. Ultimately, she is faced with making a heartbreaking decision that their mutual welfare will depend upon. As her car (and bed) breaks down and resources dwindle, she collects cans and bottles and shoplifts dog food. She encounters a group of homeless people making a fire, a self-righteous store clerk, a smug auto mechanic, a sympathetic security guard, and a psychotic drifter, among others. We see each of them from the perspective of a young woman on the verge of economic collapse and who is gradually being transformed into someone facing the possibility of homeless destitution. Wendy offers a lens through which we can see such a transformation evolve. All homeless people, unless born into this condition, were something and somewhere else first. Wendy is such a person. As the economy declines and more and more people retreat into survival mode, it will be harder for them, for us, to empathize with the Wendys of the world, young people with once bright futures now facing desperate and maybe devastating times. I have heard it said that empathy is the first hostage of survival. Wendy and Lucy is an important little film, a slice of life, that not enough people will see and that offers us a window on what more and more young people will be facing for some time to come. This film pleads with us not to close our eyes or turn our backs on them."
Untraceable             ,Mudbug711,1,crime,2008,6,"Well, I can say one thing about this movie is that is was very original. Most of the pessimistic losers out there who are fans of 'Gorror' movies will cry, and complain that it was a rip-off of the Saw series. Yeah, yeah... whatever. In reality... THIS could ACTUALLY happen. And the saddest part, is that people would log onto the site to watch THAT happen.This movie was a little slow... It is not an action movie, does not have any nudity, no car chases, no monsters, no sex, no love triangle, no street fighting.. so the average movie-goer will find it lame, slow, and boring. I like slower movies, lets you think as you watch. Diane Lane was good, but not super. She has had better, no... much better roles. Joseph Cross plays a really creepy bad guy, with sick twisted emotions.The movie was not great, but is surely was not a bad film. I believe if you are a real fan of Murder mystery, police detective films, with some thriller thrown in, you would, or may like this flick. With ONLY 1 Hr. and 40 Mins. if someone complains about length, they need to get checked for A.D.D. or they need to stick to teen-age comedies like Strange Wilderness, or Meet the Spartans.Check this movie out with an open mind, don't let the pessimists cloud your idea of this film. It is an innovative film, with a good cast, and the shots of Portland, Oregon are not bad at all. I will actually give this film a 6 1/2 out of 10. 1"
Trucker             ,jotix100,1,drama,2010,NA,"Diane Ford is a tough cookie! She is an independent spirit that decided she wanted to be a truck driver; after ten years on the road, she has even paid her vehicle. Life on the road is another story. Diane is seen in a motel room with a stranger with whom she just had sex. Whatever happened between them is now a thing of the past. She must get on the road to her next destination. Unfortunately, Diane is not prepared when she gets a visit from her former husband's companion, Jenny. It has been a while since Diane walked out on that situation. She even left her son with his father and has not seen him ever since. Jenny has come to ask Diane about taking the son back while Len is being treated for colon cancer. Jenny has to attend her father's funeral and there is not a place to leave Peter.While Diane feels this will be only a temporary arrangement. When Peter arrives at her small suburban home, she is not prepared for a stranger she hardly knows. The boy resents the abandonment. He is rebellious, and wants to leave. However much Diane tries to do the mother thing, her son would rather be in another place.""Trucker"", written and directed by James Mottern was a surprise. We have seen other films in which a mother that abandoned a child is reunited with the neglected boy. In most cases, the result is a syrupy mess. That seems not to be the case with this indie film that has two excellent performances. We were surprised by the strength of Michelle Monaghan's take on this tough woman that gave it all up in order to pursue her dream, and her independence. Jimmy Bennett, who plays Peter, brings the right amount of hatred with him, but secretly, meeting his mother, gives him a different outlook on the situation he has experienced. Others in the film include Nathan Fillion, Benjamin Bratt and Joey Lauren Adams.""Trucker"" although not a great film, is worth a look by serious fans"
One Missed Call             ,Spikeopath,0,horror,2008,5,"It's not very good, but it isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers here are making out. Personally i found it far more entertaining than drek like Stay Alive and Cry-Wolf, whilst tagging it the worst film of the year when the likes of Untraceable are on the market, beggars belief. Remaking Japanese horror is getting stale, if it was ever really fresh that is, so with that in mind i feel the hatred and backlash for this latest American remake has a touch of ""stop remaking already"". One Missed Call {Japanese original Chakushin Ari} is creepy enough, from little eerie dolls and grotesque figures to a seriously unnerving ring tone, it works as the most basic of chillers when watched alone in the dark. You will find that Final Destination and The Ring will come springing to mind as you watch this one unfold, so no great prizes for originality for sure. The acting of course is sub-standard, even Ray Wise seems to be the bread part of a camp and ham sandwich, the directing is sloppy and the ending frustrates as much as it intrigues, but the picture is creepy, and for that alone it's far more entertaining than the ream of gorno slashers that dumb the screens every other week. 5/10"
Gran Torino             ,alerter,0,drama,2008,10,"Now I understand why Clint Eastwood took over the directorial reins for Changeling from Ron Howard. (Howard dropped Changeling in order to make Frost/Nixon, instead.) Eastwood did an excellent job on Changeling, with a genuine feel for the dark subject matter, and guided Angelina Jolie to one of the best performances of her career, to date, significantly expanding her dramatic range. The film that Eastwood really wanted to make this year, GRAN TORINO, was greenlit by that other deal. This is crucial, since all of the Hmong cast are first-time actors, who were hand picked by Eastwood from cold auditions. Any film with a cast of unknowns can be a tough sell in Hollywood, even with Eastwood helming and starring. (The list of award winning Eastwood films that almost didn't get made is long and very distinguished.) In casting, Eastwood didn't want ""thespians."" He wanted an honest exactness of performance. While I really like and respect Changeling, I found GT to be far more satisfying. GT is probably *not* the best film of this year, but it is one damn fine entertainment and it fully holds its own in this rich season of films that are up for awards contention. GT is an humorous and compelling meditation on the themes of ubiquitous bigotry, culture clash, political refugee immigration/resettlement (and, by way of that, US foreign policy) and Old School, Doing the Right Thing (vs today's more commonplace ""situational"" ethics). All of this rolled into two, parallel, coming of age stories, served on platters heaping with very real slices of life. The messages crack like jabs, with the sting of truth, and are never too preachy. (Eastwood is one of the few directors who respects the intelligence of his audience. He surprises film goers, always, without ever talking down.) One coming of age story involves a neighbor kid, Tao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang), a dirt-poor son of divorced Hmong immigrants (Vietnam war political refugees). Tao lives with his mother, sister and grandmother, next door to Walt Kowalski (Eastwood). Walt insists upon calling Tao, ""Toad"" (initially, with some good reason). Tao's sister, Sue, (a scene stealing Ahney Her), is spontaneously outgoing and engaging with Walt, and confides to Walt that Tao is growing up without any proper male role models in his life. In fact, Tao is in the midst of confronting the grim prospects of either being recruited into his bad-seed cousin's gang or becoming a permanent victim of said 'bangers. The less obvious coming of age story revolves around Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed Korean War veteran. Walt's Polish ancestry seems to serve no purpose other than to establish him as ""ethnic"" white, living in a dog-eared neighborhood of ongoing immigration stories. Walt is a curmudgeon, who lacks basic ""people skills"" with even his own family, let alone the world around him. But he has managed his way though life, fine enough, up to the opening of the film's story. Just about every review I've read about GT describes Eastwood's Kowalski as a ""racist Korean War veteran,"" which misses one of the major points raised in the film -- that bigotry in the US is deeply ingrained in every niche of society. None of us is innocent or absolved of anything in this regard and the film is very frank about this point. Initially, this serves as nothing more than a source for shock humor, but Eastwood finds a way to subvert this into a message of tough-love hope. The gang life incursions into the story are very true to life. Gangs are always either recruiting new cannon fodder or marking new victims. If parents seeing this film had no clue about this, they ought to start finding ways to open up ongoing lines of discussion with their kids about what's really happening, day-to-day, at school, in the playground and elsewhere. Most of the time, kids like Tao, just internalize all of these pressures, hoping that they won't be picked on, and otherwise feeling powerless. None of us should ever kid ourselves about *all* kids, not just some kids, being ""at risk."" (As for the non-white, poly-ethnicity of Kowalski's part of town, the disbelievers of the authenticity of that have only been exposed to the rarefied 'hoods of mainstream Hollywood. I can name any number of mid-to-small cities/towns where the exact mix and flavors in GT are very real. You don't have to live in a 'hood to pass through and/or stake out an occasional corner on which to hang. The Latino and black ""presence"" in the film never implied that they lived in that neighborhood, although they were obviously trolling for victims. Perps who don't intend to be caught *rarely* hunt in their own backyards.) Walt knows that he's dead set in his ways, not all of them ""bad,"" but not most of them ""good."" Beyond the confines of his own property line, Walt may be a little more effective than Tao, out in the real world, but, he too is, in many ways, powerless to change the way most things are. Nevertheless, in getting to know Tao, Sue and the extended Hmong community to which the Lors belong, Walt discovers that his Fort Apache ways don't work anymore. Walt realizes that he has yet to finally come of age, too. (Some will call this ""atonement."" I call it ""growing up, again, at 78."" Both are spot on.) This film will make you laugh. It may even make you cry. But it might also make you think about some stuff you thought you were long ago done with thinking about. People at the screening I attended were so startled at the end that there was a significant moment of silence before applause finally broke out. GT is another lovely present from Clint Eastwood. Don't miss it."
Gran Torino             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,drama,2009,9,"I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to it. After seeing it, I realized what people were excited about, it was Clint's performance, this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls, he sounds like a great guard dog, I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is: he's a writer, director, and an actor, not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down, he's truly a good man.Walt Kowalski, a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran, lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants. At the start of the movie, Walt is attending his wife's funeral, bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich. Similarly, he has little patience with his two sons, Mitch and Steve, and their families, who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother. Walt's sons see him as ""always disappointed"" with them and their families, unaware of their obnoxiousness. Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors, a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue, live with their widowed mother and grandmother. The Hmong gang, at that point, tries to persuade Thao to join them. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. Walt interrupts the robbery, pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee. After a few days, Spider and his gang return. With Sue at his side, Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail. The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him. His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts. The conflict ends when Walt, who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division, threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn. They leave the neighborhood, telling Walt to watch his back.After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers, while her ""date"" cannot help her, Walt steps in to rescue her, confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol. Sue gets to know Walt, and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday, bringing him closer to her family, explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on ""his"" side. Sue, Thao, and their mother visit Walt the next day, with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino. Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men. Meanwhile, the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them. But when he refuses, the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment, he wants justice.I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it, it has terrific performances and a touching story. I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt, he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated. It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together, they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one. I think down the line, Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic, this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise.9/10"
The Incredible Hulk             ,anaconda-40658,0,action,2015,9,"The Incredible Hulk (2008): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell: Not a sequel to the 2003 film but a different take on the huge green monster scientist Bruce Banner transforms into once anger sets in. He is tracked down by military who wishes to subdue his power. Director Louis Leterrier does well with a decent screenplay that bares similarities to the Ang Lee version yet details additionally elements that work every bit as well. Edward Norton plays Banner who struggles to control his rage. He is sought after by the Army until a freak accident has him on the run. Years later he is discovered at a bottling plant after his blood accidentally enters a bottle. He must learn to control his rage and master this condition. Liv Tyler is no Jennifer Connelly and her demeanor throughout becomes increasingly annoying especially in her constant crying out of his name. Ty Burrell as her boyfriend is a pointless addition to the cast as well. Tim Roth plays a soldier who injects himself with the same substance used on Banner. He will mutate and engage in a thunderous battle against the Hulk. William Hurt as Ross's military father jeopardizes his relationship with his daughter while on pursuit of what he perceives as the villain. His drinking scene in the conclusion gives way to a great cameo. As good as the 2003 version sustaining its hulking effects. Score: 9 ½ / "
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,JoshuaDysart,0,misc,2010,8,"I've heard several American viewers complain that this film is all style over substance. I couldn't disagree more.I think that if a viewer is familiar with Italian Political History then this film comes off as absolutely breathtaking, and not just for its amazing filmic style. For one, the performances and interpretations of these real characters are spot on and for another the intelligence and courage to which the script approaches the ethical implications of Il Divo's actions, the breadth of moral exploration, how he defends himself to himself, to others and, often, directly to the viewer, is a welcomed shock and dose of complexity to the often polemic and overly-reductive discourse in Italian politics (not much different than here in the States in that regard). Lastly, for Italians, these events resonate incredibly and speak very much to the current power base in Italy. I truly feel that a lot of Americans are watching this film with cultural blinders on.I won't lie, it is definitely designed for people that already have a strong grasp of the history. It doesn't weigh itself down with long explanations and exposition (except in text at the beginning and end of the film) so if you're coming to this to learn every sordid detail about its subject, or for a plot, even, then you might not find much reward in it. But as an exercise in unpacking a very complicated subject with real style, it's amazin"
Adoration             ,fullautofury,0,drama,2009,7,"Every character is sympathetic, nobody is good or evil, instead showing everyone as a human being, no matter what our cultural differences are. The compelling performances(Bostick in particular) are slightly offset by an overuse of background music, in addition to the slightly non-linear structure taking some time to get used to. Despite the background music occasionally distracting from what's in front of you, Adoration is a compelling film, not just as a character study, but as an experience many will be familiar with.People like me have come to expect thoughtful pieces of celluloid from filmmakers like Egoyan and he delivers once again, even with the film's minor technical flaw"
Shutter             ,DICK STEEL,0,horror,2008,5,"Someone remind me what's the point of a remake again? A dearth of ideas? Thinking that one can do the job better? Don't laugh but one of the better Asian horror I've seen (probably amongst the first few too in recent years) was the Thai movie Shutter, which played on the plot device of spirit photography, those strange streaks of blurs that cover weird angles in a photograph, and with a vivid imagination, you can even make out faces of people you know, or know not.There are remakes which challenge on the technical fronts - having to recreate scenes shot by shot, or those helmed by master directors in the hopes of injecting some depth into characterization and story. Some filmmakers even choose to remake their own films with a different cast (Funny Games anyone?), and the list goes on. But one thing's for sure, I seriously hope that the number of Asian horror remakes start to dwindle, given that the westernized versions pale in comparison to their Asian originals, and Shutter happens to be one of them.OK, so perhaps half the fun was eliminated when you know just about every plot twist and turn, character motivation, and probably even what dialogue will come out of the actor's mouths (so I jest). But in all earnestness, I reckon that this remake will appeal more to those who have not seen the original. It's easy to be thoroughly bored because you know just what's about to come, and can eliminate red herrings, as well as spot the now-so-obviously subtle hints that the characters try to hide unsuccessfully.Also, you can bet your last dollar that Hollywood will again go over the top in trying to explain everything verbatim, as well as attempting to up the ante with the finale, but in doing so, tried too hard. I do not deny that it was much needed tension too little too late toward the end, but really, it added nothing to the plot besides succeeding in making you squirm. Technically this remade version boasts nicer production values, but lacked the edginess that the original had to offer, well, because the directing duo of Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom were rookies then, and lacked certain horrific charm and soul (pardon the pun). In fact, there was one critical scene which the Thai version had which boasted some ingenuity in a tracking shot, but one which the remake had chickened out to do, opting instead for cheap CG and unnecessary cut-shots.So the remade had blinked first, and didn't offer any really frightening moments to genuinely scare. Somehow I thought it was rather subtly pre-occupied with sex, given that you have a great looking cast with Joshua Jackson as Benjamin Shaw the photographer, and his newly wedded wife Jane Shaw, played by Rachael Taylor. For some reason, Japan gets automatically associated with Asian horror, and that's where this remake was set in, maybe because the director - Masayuki Ochiai - is Japanese too.But the final straw which I found really disturbing, was the lack of acknowledgement that this is a remake. There's nothing in the opening credits to inform the audience that it is one (the original Thai directors given only producers credits), and probably tried to pass off as an original story. Recommended of course to those who have not seen the original (even then I'd suggest you only watch the Thai version). Those who have, are advised to steer clear."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,debikal,0,misc,2008,7,"The story lacks substance, but I did not see the movie for story... I saw it for the dancing and the dancing was great. I love all dance movies though. This was definitely the movie with the best dancing, but not necessarily the best storyline. Take the Lead was a better story, but the dancing could not compare. The new characters were cool too. They had pretty good chemistry. The movie kept me totally entertained the whole time even though it was totally predictable. Like I said the dancing was what I wanted to see and I was not at all disappointed. The last 15 minutes of the movie made it definitely worth an hour and a half of my time. If you like dancing you'll love it... if you don't then you won't!"

Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,sstack-3,1,adventure,2008,8,"Upon seeing the rating on IMDb, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be terrible. However, it is a very entertaining film from start to finish...similar to the Benji movies from the 70s for those old enough to remember. Chloe, the main character, is a spoiled little chihuahua from Beverly Hills who ends up lost in Mexico and enlists the help of some canine friends in an effort to find her way home. She learns some good life lessons along the way. My kids and I were glued to the screen. Plenty of action, laughs, and occasional tears. Every child leaving the theater with us was singing the ""Chihuahua"" theme song and seemed to have loved it. I don't know what those who gave this a bad rating were expecting, but I give it a wholehearted thumbs up. 8/10"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,fnorful,0,crime,2009,NA,"This was one of my top 5 films at the 33rd Cleveland International Film Festival.In the introductory narrative we are told that ""all the events are true"". A short story is told of how a cow was stuck in the bog, dug out 6 months later and gave birth to a two-headed calf (one human, one bovine). This sad animal causes distress to the town and is put back into the bog.Well. We may not know where this is going, but it's sure to be interesting.Robert (Jakob Cedergren) has a troubled past in Copenhagen and is re-assigned to a remote Danish town, where he is quickly embroiled in its odd business. Does Jorgen (Kim Bodnia), the local force to be reckoned with, actually beat his wife Ingerlise (Lene Maria Christensen)? Is that why their daughter takes her dolly for a walk in the evening, with the squeaky wheel heard by all in the village? Why is the bicycle shop deserted, but the music blaring? And what is in the bog? The theme of the small town that runs by its own rules is well presented here. No one wants to get the ""big city"" involved. Abuse is known but ignored. The Marshall fits in in that everyone seems to have a secret in this town. A twisted ethic exists in just what needs to be done, whether the Marshall is supposed to punch out a pre-teen shoplifter (if he doesn't, Dad Jorgen will), you are supposed to say ""mohn"" instead of the usual Danish word for hello, the doctor supplies narcotics to the hairdresser/call-girl, and your clothes need to be put on the line to dry in a just-so order. And what do you do about the abused wife, who may just be playing her version of crazy with the newest Marshall? The various plot twists, the machinations of the local card-playing cabal looking for a new fourth, the (lovely) cat who says ""mohn"": all provide fit companions to the Bog. The Bog is metaphor here as a place where secrets reside, the past sometimes remains hidden and the future lies in wait. The bog is as much a character as the townspeople and the townspeople are the bog.The film alternates between disquieting views of the flat fields and frenetic twists (big and small) in the plot. I could not imagine a single scene being left out. Lovely and tense, this Euro-Noir film is well acted and well filmed; a good bet for those who like quirky and creepy."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,0,drama,2008,9,"Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With ""Button"", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.When I first heard about this movie, I had to wonder...how was Fincher, the guy responsible for realistic, gripping, crime thrillers like Seven and Zodiac going to pull off the fantasy film of a lifetime? Armed with a massive budget, Fincher uses everything a director can use to craft the most charming and technically brilliant film of the year. It's a film to be cherished for ages.""Button"" has struck me like this because a recurring theme in the film is that age is only a number, and that we as people can choose what we do with our lives, no matter what our age is. What better way to tell this message than through a story where the titular character ages backwards, and must experience life in such a way? How does one fall in love when he could one day appear young enough to be his spouse's child? How does a 5 year old play with the neighborhood children when he's confined to a wheelchair stricken with old age? Fincher's epic explores our choices, lives, and the timelessness of life itself.Brad Pitt plays the title role of Benjamin Button with a certain air of likability like he always does. While I felt he did a good job with the part, he didn't have to do much...Benjamin, fittingly, is a rather quiet character (I'd be willing to bet he narrates more than he actually talks in the film). In terms of acting, the film belongs to the ladies, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson in particular. Though Blanchett may seem overrated to some, there's no denying her unrivaled talent at playing a character as complex and deep as Daisy, and she pulls it off with ease and charisma. Taraji P. Henson will warm your heart as Benjamin's mother, as she's humorous, warm, and loving, so loving that I felt as if she was my mother.The main complexity behind the film, especially with a director like David Fincher, is keeping the film grounded in reality, while maintaining the undeniable magic within. As a director, you don't want to lose too much of either quality, instead keeping a healthy balance of the two. I feel that Fincher accomplished this perfectly. He is mainly helped out by a magical score, and absolutely stunning cinematography (which immediately identified it as a Fincher film, because of the darkness and lighting of it).Despite the wonder and awe of the film, mixed with the realism that Fincher always brings, the true allure of the film is not just Benjamin's aging problem, but the romance between Benjamin and Daisy, which is beautiful. Two people in love, regardless of age, time, or place. It's one of the most compelling romances of the year.""Button"" is also the most technically well made movie of 2008, as the true standouts are the Visual Effects and the Makeup, both of which are Oscar worthy. Pitt plays the character at almost every age, but it's almost impossible to tell when the CGI is being used on him. You know it's there, obviously, but you can't tell it's being used. When the transition is just smooth enough for the Visual Effects to be retired, but just rough enough to use makeup, it's absolutely perfect. If you've ever wanted to see Brad Pitt look 20 again, look no further, as the effects that make our actors young again (the same goes for Blanchett) are just as stunning as those that make them older.Despite a long runtime, the film never drags. If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young). This doesn't hurt the film in any way, as it's just my wishful thinking.I know I've used the word 'magical' a lot in this review, and don't think it's on accident. If I could pick one word to describe David Fincher's masterpiece, that would be it: magical. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a captivating piece of art that shouldn't be missed by anyone. 5"
Ghost Town             ,bob-rutzel-1,0,misc,2009,5,"Dentist Dr Pincus (Gervais) has a mild operation and dies on the table for 7-minutes, and comes back to life and now not only can he see dead people, but they know he can see them. And, because of that they all want something from him that they didn't finish when alive, especially Frank (Kinnear) who just died and made Gwen (Leoni) a widow.Ever notice that many comedies seem to have all the good funny stuff in the beginning and then it all peters out as the story continues? This is what we have here, but the story is okay, just don't look for too many laughs around the middle and near the end. There was good funny dialogue and not-so-good unfunny dialogue. Seems there was more of the unfunny dialogue and that is what hurt this almost comedic affair. Gervais had most of the funny lines, but he needed to have more or someone did. Didn't happen. Dr. Pincus is considered a jerk by most around him and is not-at-all a people person. Of course this opens up much for comedic hilarity as far as I was concerned, but this didn't last long or it wasn't intense enough. When the recently widowed Gwen enters the scene he is still a jerk, but is becoming less so and hence the comedy goes south. It comes back when Pincus banters with Gwen and yes, he makes her laugh. So you see where this is going?All the cast performed well. I am not that familiar with Mr. Gervais, but I do see he has the timing down pat. He just needed more lines. Despite this, the movie does save itself. Violence: Yes, getting hit by a bus counts. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sexual content: Yes. Language: Only one F-bomb and it was spoken loudly. Can't miss i"

Milk             ,barry-261,0,misc,2008,10,I always liked Sean Penn's range of characters but never had such appreciation or respect for his great work until now. This portrayal was brave and accurate in a way that only Mr. Penn could make it. The picture tried not only to portray a true story but manages to send a necessary message as well. Gus Van Sant is a brilliant and gifted director who just added another notch to his great catalog of films. James Franco and the rest of the cast are also to be rewarded for giving their hearts to a movie and message that is just as important and relevant today as it was many years ago. Due to an accident I had not been able to sit through a movie in a theater in about a year. I am glad that this is my first one back. Seeing this picture on Christmas Day is a gift in itself.

35 Shots of Rum             ,p_radulescu,0,drama,2010,NA,"This movie has the subtlety and tenderness of a miniature painting. The charm is hidden in infinitesimal details.The long opening sequence that watches without haste commuter trains running toward the large city calls in mind Ozu, and, yes, the movie is a tribute to the great Japanese master: a replica to Late Spring, offering at least two surprises.Firstly, it's Ozu filtered through the lens of Hou Hsiao-Hsien: a replica to Late Spring calling in mind Café Lumière; a French director reenacting a Japanese classic with the sensibility of a modern Taiwanese.Secondly, while transplanting the Japanese movie from 1949 in today's Paris, 35 Rhums explores other potentialities of the story. Which opens new horizons: after all, the choices made by the heroes in Late Spring raise questions with multiple answers.Like in Late Spring there is a widowed father with a daughter in her twenties. The father is of African descent, a train engineer at RER (the transit system around Paris). The daughter is studying anthropology. Like in Late Spring, both have a quiet middle-class life in the outskirts of the big city. For the father the same dilemma: realizing that the daughter should leave him and make her own life. Like in Late Spring, there is a prospect groom for the daughter, also a prospect new wife for the father. The friend who got remarried in Late Spring (a warning against loneliness) became in 35 Rhums a coworker just retired and getting quickly alienated by solitude. Even the father's assistant from Late Spring, briefly viewed as a possible match for the girl, is appearing here in 35 Rhums: a colleague of the daughter, briefly trying to date her.The two stories keep (loosely) the same line. The quiet and warm everyday between father and daughter is disrupted by a chain of totally unconnected events leading to the same conclusion: the daughter will build her own life, the father will face loneliness (getting space now for the 35 shots of rum). Even the trip made by father and daughter before her marriage can be found in both movies: a trip that offers the chance to talk about the long missing mother. The trip in Late Spring is to the ancient city of Kyoto, while in 35 Rhums it is to mother's birthplace: a German town that kept its medieval allure. But the similarities between the two movies end here.Unlike the Japanese classic, 35 Rhums is not interested at all in the plot. Without making the connection to Late Spring you wouldn't get it too much. You would realize at some point that both father and daughter speak also German fluently, you should then realize that the mother was (maybe) born in Germany, you wouldn't get it what's with the 35 shots of whatever, and were you to be too stubborn, you wouldn't even get it who's getting eventually married with whom.And that is because for the French director it is the web of human relationships that counts. Human relations, their warmth, their potentialities, never totally fulfilled, the never told dreams and hopes, the brief looks that speaks tones of volumes where words would say nothing, this is what Claire Denis is looking for in this movie. Discovering the unseen light that comes from within, celebrating it as infinite joy, and infinite ambiguity, of love; celebrating the mundane as scene for this ambiguous, pure, infinite, love. It's Ozu seen through the lens of Hou Hsiao-Hsien, a classic story subtly re-told with contemporary sensibility.This fluidity of the plot offers room for ambiguity: ambiguity of what's happening, ambiguity of sentiments. Father and daughter have built a universe of their own where they feel perfectly fine, all other relations (the father with the woman who loves him, the daughter with the man whom she eventually will marry) are kept in some sort of a backup, never rejected, never properly treated, just delaying them for later, for that 'you never know'. This while all feel that time never stops, never comes back, never repeats lost occasions.There is a superb scene that shows all this. Father and daughter, along with their prospects, are going to a concert. The car breaks, it's raining hardly, and they notice a small African restaurant. It's closed, they knock at the door, the owner reopens for them. A drink to get warmed, while the owner prepares some quick dishes, they start to dance, the father with his girlfriend, then with his daughter, the young man with the daughter, the father with the young waitress, each pair is exhaling a sense of intimacy noted with a vague discomfort by the others, while this intimacy is actually filling the whole space, is conquering everybody.Well, you would ask me what's about with the 35 shots of rum? C'est une vieille histoire (it's an old story) says the father when asked... but you should see the movie for yourselves to understand."
A Christmas Tale             ,postcefalu,1,comedy,2008,9,"After his impressing ""Kings and queen"" in 2004, Arnaud Desplechin proves that he's the best director come out from France in the last two decades with this exhilarating, moving, awfully brilliant ""A Christmas tale"". Following the path of its previous feature, the movie mixtures very hard scenes of desperation and hatred feelings with moments of absurd joy in an structure full of elliptical jumps from the past to the present and back again to the memories of another time. There's nothing new in his cinema and this is perhaps the only problem, that everything is well known yet; this is the first time that happens and today i think i have enjoyed very much the film but maybe it's time to spin around again and cut across another new ground. Desplechin knows the way."
Hancock             ,cmcmanus60,0,action,2008,6,"I also was at the test screening in Peoria AZ. The film was spot on for the first hour. Jokes were hitting left and right, Smith and Bateman displayed good chemistry, and the special effects, though not always finished, were eye popping nonetheless.Without giving it away, the final half hour was flat, straying from the comical nature that had preceded it and instead tried to get philosophical and introduce a week paint'by'numbers villain. I spoke with director Peter Berg after the film and he seemed fully aware of the issues relating to the final act. Hopefully the recent ""re shoot"" will polish up that last act, making Hancock one of the must see blockbusters of the summer. In the form I saw it; it still has a ways to go. 3"
Hancock             ,canadell,0,action,2008,7,"*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILER ***I NEVER write on these opinion boards but I might start with this one. I felt as though I needed to stick up for the movie after reading all the horrible reviews. I went to see it on the 4th, mainly because the trailers looked entertaining and because I enjoy Will Smith. This movie is not at all what I expected. There is a surprising turn of events that I did not see coming. Will Smith, in his usual style, is quick, funny, witty, and charming and I thought the timing between he and Jason Bateman was perfect. If you are expecting to see a movie along the lines of Hulk, Iron Man, Batman, etc, don't go because you won't enjoy it. If you are going because you like the cast and are ready to be entertained for 1 hour and 20 minutes out of your life, then it is definitely worth the price of admission. 1"
Prom Night             ,hellokristen,1,horror,2008,3,"and rent a GOOD horror movie. It's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"".In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written. Stupid ""we're going to the prom"" junk. I wanted to claw my ears off. Honestly, ""The Hills"" has better dialog.There really was no need to make this movie. Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking ""Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?"" All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). The people are like mentally disabled sheep.By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (So boo hoo for you!) None of the killings is the least bit interesting. Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.The only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. ""Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer -- AIIEEEE!"" And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore.The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.(Oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) So save your money and rent ""Carrie"" or ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" or ""Scream"" or ""Scary Movie"" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists."
Frozen River             ,Chris Knipp,1,crime,2008,6,"In this ""acclaimed Sundance drama,"" first-time director Courtney Hunt explores the situation of a desperate white American family living near the border between New York and Quebec. A Mohawk reservation overlaps the border in a sort of free zone. Driving over the frozen water of the title allows Ray Eddy (veteran actress Melissa Leo) temporarily to earn quick money by smuggling illegals into the US with the grudging assistance of a young Mohawk woman called Lila (Misty Upham), who's done it before. Ray's husband is a gambling addict who's gone missing right before Christmas leaving Ray to make balloon payments on a dreamed of three-bedroom ""double wide"" trailer home and a rent-to-own flat-screen TV. She's left alone with two sons, five and fifteen, with Christmas days off. On her part-time job at The Yankee Dollar, she's not going to make it. The dice are not turning up right for the Eddys.A feeling of doom pervades 'Frozen River' from the opening tight closeup of Leo's deeply lined face as she sucks on a cigarette and quietly weeps. Things are so bad, the regular fare in the house is popcorn and Tang. Ricky (James Reilly) is a small boy who needs to be watched. He wants some violent video game for Christmas. The remaining male in charge is Ricky's photogenic fifteen-year-old brother T.J. (Charlie McDermott, whose first appearance was in Shyamalan's The Village). T.J. sees through mom's promises that all will be well and staunchly refuses to eat another popcorn-Tang dinner.Ray's visit to the local bingo hall in search of her lost husband leads her to spot that Lila is driving his car, which he's abandoned. She follows Lila to the ""res"" to confront her and one thing leads to another. Inexplicably and not particularly in character, Ray pulls out a pistol and shoots it to get Lila's attention.This is how it goes more or less from then on. There is a certain compulsive watchability to Hunt's downbeat tale in the way Ray must commit one desperate act after another in her misguided effort to avoid the worst Christmas ever. But this very intensity prevents the film from being allowed to breathe--to grant its characters a moment of reflection, to grant us in the audience a chance to get the feel of the locations. A cup of tea--or a glass of Tang--shared between the two women; anything to let us know them better. Instead many little plot details are slipped in, sometimes inconsistently and unconvincingly, complicating things without deepening them. And anybody with minimal perspective would see that this story is rigged, and often carelessly so.The smuggling runs that constitute the film's claim to ""thriller"" status are clumsy, wordless affairs. A couple of Chinese men and then a couple of Chinese women are loaded into the trunk and money passed into the car and laboriously counted. For some reason Lila, whose vision is poor, has no glasses, so Ray has to do the counting as well as drive. A Pakistani couple get the same treatment and a hair-raising, and ultimately highly dubious, episode involves their backpack, which Ray tosses into the snow instead of bringing it along. As an example of the shaky writing, Ray expresses complete ignorance of Pakistan yet immediately assumes the couple are terrorists and their bag loaded with explosives or poisons. T.J. too gets into trouble, conning a lady, apparently Indian, into giving him her credit card number over the phone. How do the res police trace this back to him later? Another fudged detail. 'Frozen River' needs a lot of edits and more time spent on developing the sense of place. Despite the ostensible location this has the feel of a generic miserabilist weepy.Contrast this with Lance Hammer's terrific recent film 'Ballast,' a drama about poor black people in the Mississippi Delta. 'Ballast's' starting points closely resemble 'Frozen River's:' grim poverty, a stark rural setting, family conflict, a missing father, a teenage boy led astray partly because of the mother's inability to cope through a job much like Ray's in 'Frozen River'. But Hammer wisely kept it simple, including a shooting early on not for drama so much as to start things off, thereafter mixing the direness with the everyday, letting the characters emerge as individuals. Religiously pursuing regional flavor, Hammer drew all his actors from the area. He listened to the voices, and created an outstanding sound design. He allowed the story to move in a positive direction. He also let scenes unfold at their own pace, soaking up the atmosphere and allowing the people to seem authentic. Ballast's action is just as intense, but its characters work with what they've got instead of pursuing illegal fantasies. There's never a detail that feels wrong. In 'Frozen River,' many do, some are factually inaccurate, and scenes are awkward.. Hunt's film revels in desperate details, yet has a soft, inconclusive ending. If your people are doomed, let the doom come! Despite the awards, Hunt has a lot to learn"
Saw V             ,boknows11212,0,crime,2008,2,"Being a huge Saw fan I can say without a doubt I look forward to each and every offering but this years installment was by far the worst of the bunch. I never claim Saw movies feature terrific acting( besides 1 and 3) but 5 featured some atrocious performances. On one hand you have the wooden Strahm who is literally dictating his thought to... well no one, on the other is Julie Benz, normally a fine actress in Dexter, spouting of ridiculous lines that sound meant for trailers (ex. "" It's our next nightmare""). On top of that the movie is just full of sloppy film-making. Let's start with Strahm, he's just unnecessary, he seems only to be there as a vessel to fuel the flashbacks. On to the main trap, The best of the characters is killed in just the second room. Why did they even have to kill him? He was savvy and sharp but I guess the director just wanted to remove all intelligence from this movie. Finally the ending. This might be the worst evidence of a cash-grab I have ever seen. There was no ending, as my friend put it "" It's like they ran out of ideas for 6 movies so they cut five in half"", and thats really how it felt, INCOMPLETE."
Good Dick             ,conthesleepy1,1,misc,2009,7,"This film is definitely 'watchable.' Its the sort of film you start to watch expecting very little from but end up very satisfied you decided to 'give it a go.'Marianna Palka who directed/wrote and stars in this is a fine actress who right at the start reminded me of Helena Bonham Carter for some reason (please feel free to disagree) - she is certainly a talent worth keeping a eye on.Overall a good film that will leave you pleased you viewed it. Possibly better to rent than to go to the cinema, but that I suppose is my own interpretation!Enjoy."
Death Race             ,Jacques98,0,action,2008,1,"When you know you're going to see another pointless action movie, and you know it will have little to no redeeming value minus the action, and it STILL sucks, the problem has to be the action.From start to finish, the movie was bland and boring. I wanted to leave after the first 5 minutes as it was, and after that it was like sitting through one of those bad documentaries at school for the other 2 hours. The action was predictable and just downright boring, generic, and pathetic. Add to that the utterly ridicules dialogue scenes that told you things you already know from the credits mixed with clichés from every single action movie ever freaking made, and it felt like I was watching a made-for-TV drama, not an action movie. You've seen this movie before. Hundreds of times.The acting, as well, was horrid. The chick they got to play the cliché ""bad prison woman"" reminded me of Martha Stewart . . . dumbed down and made even more cliché than the real woman. At one point when a ""bad man"" character came on screen I had to say:""Look, it's Mr. Evil!"" as he cackled with his huge nose casting a cliché shadow. Everything that could have been menacing in this film was laughable.There is no more blood in this movie than PG-13 fares like Cloverfield, and it wasn't as violent as the PG-13 The Dark Knight. Every scene was a cut-off scene without anything graphic happening, and at some points even the fist fights were cut-off scenes. I cannot think of any movie with ""violence"" as utterly pathetic as this one. It barely earned its R-rating through a minimal amount of blood, and the rest was PG all the way.I do not know why anyone would find anything in this entertaining. There was maybe a couple action scenes, and the rest was your mother's cliché TV drama. Am I the only one who wishes action movies were, you know, action-packed anymore?"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,TheLittleSongbird,0,animation,2009,7,"Of course there are flaws with it, but it is not as bad as people say it is, but it could have been much better. It is dull in comparison to works by Pixar and Dreamworks, but I did actually enjoy it. There are better animated films out there, namely Beauty and the Beast but there have been a lot worse animated films as well, like the sequel to the Secret of Nimh. The script has its ups and downs, but I did actually laugh at a bit of the humour that was attempted. I do agree though that the female flies fainting act was overdone quite badly. The animation, in its 2D and 3D form is actually nicely done, in fact a vast majority of it was amazing. The main flaw with the film is the story. A bit slow and predictable, but the voice talents did well to redeem themselves in the slower bits. Another problem was the ending, Buzz Aldrin telling us that this wasn't a true story was unnecessary, we know that already. About the pace, although the film is relatively short, it just feels longer. But believe me, there has been a lot worse 3D films like Spy Kids 3, (with little sense of wonder, predictable story lines and an embarrassing cameo from Sylvester Stallone) The voice talents were very good. Christopher Lloyd made a good effort with Grandpa, and the three child flies were well done. Nicollette Sheridan also did well as his love interest, Nadia. Tim Curry, Russian accent and all, a little reminiscent of Von Talon in Valiant, also does well, despite his character being in the film for about 10 minutes, and his questionably meagre material. Most impressed me most was the soundtrack, with ""Fly me To The Moon"" and Strauss's Blue Danube waltz, which is one of my favourite pieces of classical music. All in all, a good film, that suffered because of the story, but I will say it was very dull at times. Whether you want to watch it is up to you. 7/10. Bethany Co"
Gran Torino             ,scottedwards007,0,drama,2008,9,"seeing the trailer for this film kinda made me expect id be watching Dirty Harry in the suburbs.What I saw was a bittersweet superbly written, well acted story of humanity and friendship,this film is something that we can all relate to in some way, and isn't Hollywooded up in anyway, the film tells it story without any un needed hidden undertones that so many mainstream directors do to films.Eastwood is excellent as the hard nosed war vet, and his direction is perfect as always, and supporting cast did there job just fine tooClint Eastwood was perfect for the role and as director, as he has the knack of taking a story and making a film for the audience to get sucked into the story, and not for critics to pick apart....great film making, 2"
The Objective             ,bezoris2,,horror,2014,8,"Friends ask me this question fairly frequently - especially now that the movie's been back on Netflix. I thought I'd post my analysis, which, for what it's worth, has satisfied most of them... (My background is in Eastern philosophy and mythology, which this movie is primarily about and why I'm asked this question.)(1) The Background (2) The AnalysisFirst question is usually, ""What are those balls of fire? Ufos, ghosts, souls?"" Short answer is: none of the above. Or at least, not specifically. In order to answer this question, it's necessary to understand what ""a Vimana"" is and how they function in Indian religion and mythology. (1)Vimanas are, in short, ""chariots of the gods."" They are typically depicted as peaked royal palanquins or stupas (peaked temples), hence their visual representation as triangles. But they are also occasionally birds, as in the case of Vishnu's mount Garuda, or winged structures.In Hindu mythology, existence consists of seven higher and seven lower heavens or planes of existence. When Indra, leader of the Devas (a group of lesser gods) wants to visit earth he - you guessed it - jumps in to his Vimana and shoots down to our plane of existence. Running through all planes of existence is an endless pillar of fire, lingodbhava-murti, the primal form of Shiva, the creator (that later also includes Vishnu at the bottom and, generally, Brahma at the top). While the pillar is endless in Hinduism, in Buddhism the top of the pillar ends at Brahma until Buddha (or anyone) achieves enlightenment, at which point it becomes endless. The top of the ""Brahma pillar"" is a triangular structure with Brahma's three faces representing dominion, or arbitration, over the past, present and future (he looks in to or ""sees"" all-time). The lingodbhava-murti, then, is both endless (spaceless) and timeless or ""out of time.""But what does all of this have to do with the movie?(2)So, Keynes and his team are off searching for Vimanas in the desert. And they find them: the arrival of Vimanas signified by helicopter sounds (""birds"" - see above), triangular structures, and the small metal airplane (a chariot with wings). But why is the metal airplane first discarded in the dirt by the oasis and later clutched in Keynes' hand at the end?Specifically, Keynes achieves a form of enlightenment as indicated by the touch on his forehead at his third eye (a common association), his levitation (another common trope), his ""open eyes"" in the medical suite, and his entrance into - or acceptance by - the Vimana. At this point he has moved outside of our specific plane and is traveling throughout existence. He too ""sees all.""There are also, I believe, references to quantum mechanics and string or multiverse theory at this point - specifically with regards to the flares. Waveform collapse, in quantum mechanics, refers to when an infinite number of possibilities, or potentialities, collapse (mathematically) in to a decision point or ""singularity."" (Interestingly, both waveforms and strings are often described as ""vibrating"" and waves - after all - DO vibrate; another sly association, I think, with his vibrating hand.) In certain forms of multiverse theory these decision points do not cancel out other potentialities (as in QM) but birth additional universes in which they did occur: a universe in which you went left instead of right, called your mother back instead of ignored her, liked peanut butter instead of hating it, etc, ad infinitum.The flares, then, are all from Keynes. As Keynes begins to ""enter"" the Vimana and transcend - or move out of - fixed existence he/we begin to see his entire waveform - if you will - or his mutiverse of singularities. We see flares that he might have sent up or did in another space/time-line... past, present and future. Simultaneously. There are also reasons to believe that his wife is actually dead during the timeline we observe in the film (from earlier dialogue, his weeping over his wife's picture, references to why he took the mission in the first place knowing it was suicidal (nothing to live for)). Yet she's alive at the end credits giving an interview? And the plane is both in his hand and back at the oasis... Notice, too, that the final ascentional montage contains formulas from Einstein's relativity theorem (on Space-Time) and what appears to be the head of Brahma, among other symbology. Neat!Finally, why is Keynes apparently ""saved"" or ""enlightened"" when everyone else gets blown away? On somewhat shaky ground here, but I think, possibly, that he is meant to be seen as at least seeking enlightenment, attempting to ""see farther,"" while the rest of the group do not. This evidenced, mainly, by his camera... Of the large, monocular variety, as you recall: literally ""a third eye."" The only other group member to individually see the other ""travelers"" dies after having seen them through his BINOCULAR night vision goggles (and killing the guardian/ascetic/enlightened old guy).As far as production goes, I agree with most other reviewers: it certainly could have benefited from a larger budget. But it worked for me and I'm a fan of deliberate, well-done low-budget sci-fi (as well as the other kind).If you'd like more of this, I recommend Shane Carruth's two fantastic movies: ""Primer"" and ""Upstream Color."" Also can't say enough about ""Valhalla Rising,"" another great ""film of ideas."" Bone up on your Dante, Apocrypha (Dismas/The Harrowing of Hell) and Norse mythology to enjoy that one though... But if you do, it's fantastic.For what it's worth, I have no connection whatsoever to anyone involved in the production of these films...Best, Chris."
Slumdog Millionaire             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,drama,2008,NA,"The editing, digital cinematography, and Danny Boyle's direction (with co-director Loveleen Tandan) create a fascinating aesthetic which is perfect for the material. However, barely anyone (among the vast minority of people and critics who didn't care for this massively acclaimed film) is complaining about the film's technical virtues however, so how about all that contrived, sappy melodrama? To my surprise, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is very tasteful in almost every respect. The romance scenes are either beautifully understated (most of the scenes with them as children/young teenagers, and a couple after that) or fantasy melodrama like much of the stuff near the end of the film (although the actual final pre-credit shot itself is again, a tender and beautiful moment). I have no issues with the fantasy melodrama however, because most of the film is done in that tone. Even the very realistic and brutally true-to-life scenes involving the raids of Muslim sections of the slums by Hindus, and the luring of children to a life of begging on the streets (for gangsters and criminals) in exchange for accommodation and food are done in a manner that is both tastefully evocative of reality while fitting in tone with much of the rest of the film, which has a more hopeful tone. It sounds improbable, but that's what the screenwriter and director(s) achieve here. The film doesn't strive for 'gritty realism', but everything in the film (yes, everything) is perfectly evocative of reality. The trouble with 'gritty realism' is that it often is gritty and hopeless in a way life rarely is to most of us, and is actually laughable if done wrong. Jamal's flashbacks to the begging end in misery, but before that we get the happiness and relief of slum life that these children felt. The raid is unrelentingly horrifying, but it is a haunting memory rather than something the film dwells on without stopping. The film also gives us scenes of comedic escapism which are still within the realm of plausibility as well. If you don't know the general plot by now, here it is: Jamal is a boy from the slums of Mumbai who has reached the final question on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" against all odds. The film, through a plot device I won't reveal even though it's only a mild spoiler, reveals the sources of Jamal's knowledge of the answers to each question (except for the ones he doesn't know and guesses at/uses the lifelines for) through flashbacks to him throughout his childhood and teenage years. Here enter the accusations of the film's supposedly 'hilarious', 'impossible', and 'dumb' contrivances. There's no way a chai wala knows the answers to those questions, and it's too convenient that he happens to have experienced something suitable for all those answers. I beg to differ. With a life like Jamal's (which is, believe it or not, being led right now by many children in India) I should hope that he gained at least that much knowledge. He didn't actually know the answers to every question, and on a game of both luck and knowledge it's entirely plausible to me that Jamal's game could actually happen. The only huge contrivance is the nature of the very last question and what happens when it's asked, but by then the movie had me in its grasp and the ploy worked. The fact that every member of the cast is absolutely excellent, including the child actors, doesn't hurt either. It sounds odd, but ""Slumdog Millionaire"" seemed to me like it found a way to combine a realist look at India (and, according to the Indian person with whom I attended the film, it is absolutely spot-on in almost every regard, and certainly doesn't contradict anything I saw during my short visit to India) and a romantic melodrama. The end result, with the screenplay that combines the drama, comedy, and thriller genres to great effect, is both an aesthetic triumph, and unlikely as it sounds, a crowd-pleasing masterpiece. Also, the music is brilliant, both the original score by the legendary A.R. Rahman and the excellent choices made when it comes to the pop music included in the film (though that is to be expected from a Danny Boyle film). As for those moaning about the love story, perhaps you have not found that person yet, get back to me when you do. 2"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,pivic,1,misc,2008,8,"Brilliant film about the Baader-Meinhof group, i.e. one of the most active modern terrorist groups. The film starts with showing people peacefully demonstrating against the Shah of Iran and his wife who were visiting Western Germany in the late 60s; on signal, supporters of the Shah and the police rush and senselessly beat demonstrators into pulp. The imagery is one that will not soon leave my mind, being extremely reminiscent of what happened in the G8 protests at Genoa and Gothenburg about 30 years later. Back to the film: the leftist movement is at this time very much against the police state that Western Germany has become. As the hippie 60s obviously didn't help much with turning things around, the early 70s - brought on by with the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, the US carrying on their war in Vietnam with Nixon coming into power and the West German government was being accused for merely being a puppet in the hands of imperialist America, some people wanted to turn things around without using flowers and kind words. These people were seriously convinced that the word was revolution, and used kidnapping, bombs and bullets for change. This film is the story of the core of the Baader-Meinhof group, and it's close to the best political cinema I've ever seen; the direction, the acting, the script, the editing and the music...it's as if the make-up is washed away from how political films usually are, leaving the viewer to decide what's right and wrong. It's interesting to see how the Baader-Meinhof group works as the members are increasingly isolated and brain-wash each other by simply interacting with their hardcore ideals as the base. Brilliant and highly recommendable, of course no matter what your personal political ideas are."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,ChrisWasser,1,misc,2008,9,"I agree with the other comments on the following points: the film does indeed concentrate on the culprits and their actions in a documentary way (as opposed to an interpretation of the RAF's ideas and motivations from a clear-cut political standpoint). Although the victims DO appear they are not characterized more closely; the only representative of the state is Horst Herold (head of the BKA), politicians do not show up at all, the media appear only in the shape of Springer, konkret and Spiegel and even the lawyers (Haag, Croissant, Schily, Ströbele, etc.) are merged into only one (fictitious?) character. I for one do agree with this approach and if you are prepared for it you probably can live with it too. In any case, despite all the chases, shootouts and explosions it hasn't become a mere action-film. What's more problematic is that the film follows the book by Stefan Aust VERY closely. Therefore the dramaturgy is more similar to ""real life"" than to a classical feature film (e.g. there are many changes in pace, several climaxes are distributed over the course of the film and a proper arc of suspense is somewhat missing). ""Fortunately"" real life offered a culmination of events with the Schleyer kidnapping in the ""German Autumn"" 1977, so that the film ends in a reasonably satisfying way. Nevertheless the end credits come a little abruptly.The second problem is that the film tries to show virtually ALL events from the book (only some minor incidents like the Mahler detention, Peter Urbach, the burglaries in registration offices in order to steal blank passports or the visit of Jean-Paul Sartre in Stammheim are missing) so that it needs to squeeze 10 years of history into 140 minutes. The result is a film with breakneck speed at some points. The better scenes (e.g. the training camp in Jordan or the lawsuit in Stammheim) are obviously those where the film catches breath, calms down and takes its time for the actors to shine.The quality of the acting ranges from good to fantastic (with very few exceptions like Alexandra Maria Lara, who is nothing more than wide-eyed again and who thankfully doesn't even have dialogue). Especially Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek are sensational. It is THEIR film and the conflicts in Stammheim which led to Meinhof's suicide are acted Oscar-worthy. But Michael Gwisdek (Ensslin's father), Jan Josef Liefers (Peter Homann), Sebastian Blomberg (Rudi Dutschke), Nadja Uhl (Brigitte Mohnhaupt) and Hannah Herzsprung (Susanne Albrecht) are also very good.The production values are excellent too. A lot of locations, a great deal of main and supporting roles, hundreds of extras, good special effects (mainly explosions) and a set design and costume design which creates a very coherent 70's atmosphere: you can see that the film cost a lot of money. Every cent is on the screen.I didn't like the choice of music that much. Deep Purple's ""Child in Time"" is always great to hear, but the rest (Janis Joplin, The Who, Bob Dylan) is just too mainstreamy and unimaginative for my taste (but probably also very expensive). Why not use MC5, Ton Steine Scherben or Ennio Morricone's ""Vamos a matar, companeros""?Now I'm looking forward to the reactions and reviews from other countries, who probably don't know this part of German history very well. In the US I expect the criticism that there are too many naked people, too many swear words and even more cigarettes (every one in BMK smokes everywhere and at all times), in order to distract from the politics of the film ;-) ""Der Baader Meinhof Komplex"" isn't the masterpiece on the history of the first generation of the RAF that I had hoped for in my comments on ""Todesspiel"", but altogether it is a very suspenseful, fascinating, densely narrated and well acted film. Hopefully it will not be the last word on the subject, but it succeeds in giving the audience the basic RAF knowledge on which future (less neutral, more opinionated) movies can build their stories. 1"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,cerasea,0,misc,2008,1,"I think it's in ""fluff pieces"" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous. The movie claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class barriers, but the plot only served to highlight and exploit these divisions. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes would have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves. It's easy to believe that observations like this will only fall on deaf ears, but I hope more people (in audiences and in the movie industry) will be less naive whenever another studio decides to mass-market such ignorance"
Death Race             ,Nervegas,0,action,2008,6,"I was able to attend the advanced screening here in Dallas and must say I enjoyed myself immensely. While anyone going into this film expecting anything more then a thin veil of a plot will be sorely disappointed, it will definitely entertain those who have the right expectations. That said, this is a no holds barred, testosterone fueled thrill ride. Think of the game Twisted Metal, then throw in convicts, a greedy warden looking only at the profit and you have Death Race. While the movie has plenty of explosions, machine guns, armored cars, gore and beautiful females, there was enough humor and sentiment thrown in to make it all seem worthwhile. Definitely an entertaining film, and one that any over-the-top action movie junkie will surely add to their collection. "
Prom Night             ,gimmemore10,1,horror,2008,1,"Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would). 1"
Space Chimps             ,krazy_boi_nat,,animation,2008,7,"A really good family film about a performing chimp that ends up getting unwilling sent up to space with two after chips one big headed male chimp and one female with lots of adventures on the way and on the planted they land on with some unlikely guest. Its one of those films that mum ,dad but mainly the children all can enjoy, the animation is quit simply but still of a descent 21st century quality but gives the dream works film a nice colourful cartoony light harted feel to it that leaves you with a smile on your face as you leave the cinema. The storyline plot is also nothing new as every one lives happily ever after but I guess if it dint it would not be a good film for children. To add on the plot it is not how you say out of this world brilliant but it is still very funny and nice and easy to follow (again for the children) making it a top film if it's a rainy day to take the kids to or just to watch at home on DVD with a beer. I enjoyed it and at the end of the day that's what you what from a film, to enjoy it 7/10"
Untraceable             ,Dragoneyed363,1,crime,2008,8,"That is the one word I will tell you perfectly sums up and describes my opinions towards this awesome film and it's bogus reception. Untraceable was a suspenseful thriller with great action, fun death strategies, and wonderful acting, that has a ridiculous amount of unappreciative reviews and hate aimed at it in all the areas that a lot of people have no problems with in other movies.Diane Lane was a great actress in this film. As I have said, the performances are excellent, and she of course gives the best and she made the movie totally believable and enjoyable. While there were of course flaws, I found the story line and the movie itself to be great entertainment. I found myself yelling at the screen and telling the people in the film what to do, and I am not that interested in a film unless it manages to get my adrenaline up, which I find as a positive factor in few cases whilst viewing a movie.There were things I found predictable, and of course the film gets a little out of hand at times, which as I said, it's not flawless, but it wasn't meant to be, and most of the time I was so interested in the movie that I wasn't making any presumptions or criticizing the faults. This was a wonderful film, that is under appreciated and if you haven't seen it, I recommend you do if you are capable of being lenient on these sorts of films."
Goodbye Solo             ,druid333-2,0,drama,2009,10,"This is the fourth feature film by North Carolina born film maker (but of Persian descent),Ramin Bahrani, and I'm overjoyed to announce,this film is every bit as good as the first two I've seen by him ('Man Push Cart',from 2005,and 'Chop Shop',from 2007). Bahrani has the gift of telling the emigrant experience from the emigrant's perspective. The story:a taxi cab driver,simply called Solo (played by a likable Souleyman Sy Savane)gets a fare in his cab one night,who wants him to drive him a long distance for reasons unsaid. William (the fare,played by one time Elvis Presley bodyguard,Red West)is an embittered,burnt out shell of a man who just wants to be left alone. He seems to be content being dropped off at the same cinema,night after night to stare at the young man at the ticket window (for reasons that are never entirely revealed). Solo agrees to take William to this high mountain peak,but balks at the idea that William may just want to jump off the mountain. The bulk of this film finds Solo trying to intervene in Williams life (much to the chagrin of William,himself),and trying to somehow bond a friendship with a man who has been beaten by life one too many times. A subplot involving Solo's step daughter,Alex (played by Diana Franco Galindo)dovetails nicely among the (potential) despair of William's lack of zeal in life. I eagerly await anything new by Bahrani down the pipeline (although I've heard that he has directed a couple of short films prior to 'Man Push Cart'). Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive raunchy language & smokin"
Four Christmases             ,Robert_Scott,1,comedy,2008,NA,"To be fair, I should explain right away I had no intention of seeing this movie at all not to mention Vince Vaughn hasn't done anything very good like Swingers and Made in some time (to me, Wedding Crashers and The Break Up were just O.K.). In fact, the bitter taste from last year's disappointing Fred Claus was still present when my girlfriend said she wanted to see this movie tonight. Of course, I cringed at the idea while mildly protesting but eventually gave in with the prospect of secretly indulging in an unspoken ""I told you so"". Only kidding, that thought never crossed my mind...Anyways, I didn't even really know what this was about before seeing it but it didn't take long for the plot to be outlined after a pretty funny scene at the airport. Basically, after 3 years of avoiding spending time with their families on Christmas (remember, you can't spell families without ""lies""), Kate and Brad find themselves in an unfortunate situation this year that forces them to spend Christmas with their divorced parents and very dysfunctional siblings. This concept could go either way for me because I really liked Christmas Vacation but disliked The Family Stone. Fortunately, just as it started out great this continued to be more like Christmas Vacation all the way through with several laugh out loud funny dialog and various slapstick that had the whole theater roaring with laughter. One of my favorite parts was a Nativity play where Vince Vaughn effectively delivers some hilarious over the top scenery chewing that had everybody in stitches... well, except Kate.As funny as I thought this was, it wouldn't be a real Christmas movie without delivering some sort of constructive message among all the chaos. Since I can empathize with Vaughn in his situation with Kate, the film's resolution probably had more personal impact for me. I can also understand the criticism that most of the talented cast was wasted in comparison because the family situations were not addressed equally. What I liked the most about the film's brief serious turn is it wasn't syrupy while providing some genuine touching moments thanks to the believable acting skills of Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn and of course the two screen legends, Bobby DuVall and Jon Voight. Best Christmas movie I've seen since Bad Santa and yes, I will listen to my girlfriend's suggestions without being such a Scrooge from now on:) "
Goodbye Solo             ,howard.schumann,0,drama,2009,9,"Some people are so attached to their story that they manage to continually sabotage their aliveness and their capacity for love. Even when someone reaches out to them and challenges the skewed way in which they have constructed their world, they effectively shut them out. Ramin Bahrani's third feature, Goodbye Solo, is about William, a man clinging to his victimization act so tightly that he turns away from the only person who cares, a high-energy cab driver from Senegal who is willing to go the extra mile to tear down the wall that separates William from his fellow human beings.Similar in narrative to Abbas Kiarostami's masterpiece A Taste of Cherry, Solo (Souléymane Sy Savané) a Senegalese immigrant living in Winston Salem, North Carolina (where the director grew up) picks up a 72-year-old Caucasian passenger named William, played by Red West, a former Marine, stuntman, boxer, and bodyguard for Elvis Presley, who Solo refers to as ""Big Dog"". We learn next to nothing about the cantankerous old man. He refuses to engage the gregarious Solo in conversation except to offer him $1000 to drive him to Blowing Rock, a windy mountainous area, in two weeks with the depressing implication that it will be the end of the road for him, both literally and figuratively.Similar in theme to Mike Leigh's Poppy in Happy-Go-Lucky, Solo does not back off from his selfless display of good humor even when confronted by William's cold rejection. He maintains his optimism when studying for an exam to become a flight attendant. Solo knows where to find drugs or a sexual partner but there is no hint that he ever partakes. Eventually some of his positive attitude begins to break down barriers. William helps Solo in his studying, and allows him to move into his motel room when he runs into marital difficulties with his pregnant Mexican wife (Carmen Leyva). They go out drinking together, Solo introduces him to his stepdaughter Alex (Diana Franco Galindo), does his laundry for him, checks his medicine stash to see if he has some hidden terminal illness, and even searches the motel room to try and find a picture of a relative he could contact.Gradually the two men appear to draw closer, at times showing moments of connection, and then falling back into uncertainty and rejection. Solo still searches for the clue that can prevent the inevitable, even going so far as to find out why William continually attends a local movie theater and engages in conversation with the young cashier at the box office. Bahrani's Solo is not a stereotype of the cool hip black man out to rescue the forlorn white man from himself. Solo is a multi-faceted human being with his own set of problems who is always depicted with respect. The finale, shot in the beautiful North Carolina Mountains in October, captures the stirring symphony of autumn color, and the long look that William and Solo give each other before they part is the essence of compassion, given freely with an open heart - even to the point when no payback is achieved or expected."
Garden Party             ,wryter64,1,drama,2008,NA,"Los Angeles is a city of transplants, every person arriving with a dream that is eventually shown to be an illusion in the harsh light of city's reality. GARDEN PARTY weaves this theme beautifully with an ensemble cast of up-and-comers. The film introduces each character as a classic archetype - the runaway teen, the frustrated artist, the demanding successful boss, the aspiring musician, the dead-end job dreamer - but the film then spends its time delving deep into the personalities behind these stereotypes, revealing them all as individuals as it entangles them in various plots that flirt with destruction but offer redemption. Along the way there is porn, pot, homelessness, backstabbing, tools from the entertainment industry, superficiality, revenge ... and love!As a native Angeleno, what struck me most was how this film captures the mundane, day-to- day existence of Los Angeles with every hint of glamor and Utopian paradise removed from the stark cityscape. What GARDEN PARTY delivers is an accurate and memorable vision of the city of Angels being a landscape of personalities, each with a dream, some with a dark side and most with a sympathetic humanity underneath it all."
Frost/Nixon             ,David_Frames,0,misc,2008,7,"It wasn't exactly a meeting of minds, nor was it motivated by a need to get to the truth, but the set of interviews that brought disgraced President Richard Nixon into a room with David Frost, is a fascinating historical tit bit <U+0096> an act of opportunism on both sides that lead to one of the most sensational disclosures in the history of television political journalism. Nixon had broken the law and this unlikely confessional took place in the company of a light entertainment presenter. Imagine Tony Blair confessing he lied about the reasons for going to war in Iraq to Des O Connor and you realise how amazing this actually was.Howard's film is fairly dispassionate in its treatment of both men. Frost, played with delicious smarm and just the right amount of arrogance by Michael Sheen, is constituted as a fledgling but highly libidinous talk show host, who in Nixon sees an opportunity to reinvigorate his celebrity and gain credibility in the US. Nixon on the other hand is in denial about his role in the Watergate scandal, fired up with a sense of self-righteousness and indignation at the liberal 'sons of bitches' that brought him down and is determined to use the encounter to rewrite history to his own advantage. Both men, it's suggested, have something to prove to themselves and their peers but mercifully the shadowy reflection angle isn't laboured en route to the tense exchanges. The climax, when it comes, manages to be both mesmerising and moving, not least because both actors meet the requirement of transcending mere impersonation and inhabit their characters. When you're told that Nixon's face betrayed, better than any trial, the personal regret, hubristic folly and watershed breakdown in the relationship between the American electorate and its government, thanks to Frank Langella, you believe it."
Street Kings             ,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,,misc,2010,8,"When I first took this in at the theater, I had high expectations, and it still blew me away. I remain spell-bound by this. It is an extensively well-thought-out and entertaining film. The plot is compelling, engaging and keeps developing, and while I had a hunch about one twist, I did not see them all coming. This has spot-on pacing, not a boring second to be found, or an overwhelming one for that matter. The cinematography and editing are excellent throughout. Every moment of the action is awesome, intense and exciting without being unrealistic(within the bounds of Hollywood, that is... which, if going by this, is actually entirely acceptable), and there is a solid and fitting amount of it. The music is appropriate for where this is set, not to mention really cool, consisting mainly of hardcore rap. As you can probably figure out, the tone of this is brutal, dark and gritty, through and through, and should not be viewed by anyone who may not be able to take it. The writing is astounding; the script, the dialog, the overall story, all of it. There is a lot of slang(the subtitles certainly helped me out), and some instantly memorable and utterly quotable lines. Almost all of the humor, which is also very rough(and the amount of which is considerable), lies in what is said, how it's put and/or its delivery; think verbal, British comedy(with four-letter words). The characters are distinguished, credible, and psychologically accurate, with no real exceptions, and while there is a heavy dose of macho-ism and bloated egos(some bits are soaked in, and dripping, testosterone), it never gets ludicrous, and there are several characters who help keep it grounded, in their more agreeable personalities. I think it is also notable that this, beyond a sequence lasting no longer than a few seconds, this does not at any point stoop to the lowest common denominator and try to appease and appeal to the young male demographic by simple parading something to gawk at. This isn't denying the existence of such, it just has nothing gratuitous in the way of it other than aforementioned brief part. The acting is magnificent, for basically every part(I owe Evans a heartfelt apology, the guy can actually do great work, and be pretty bad-ass), Reeves is believable, and Whitaker performs well in everything required of him in this. Both Laurie and Mohr, honestly, if you didn't know they usually go for making people laugh, you wouldn't know from this, they're straight-faced and professional all the way(and I'm not saying they're not funny in this). There is plenty of disturbing content and a ton of strong violence and language in this. The DVD holds an interesting director's commentary, a handful of informative featurettes, deleted scene with the option of hearing Ayer's thoughts on them(by the way, David, if I may call you that, I promise you, you put another movie up on the silver screen, and I *will* almost without a doubt go to the cinema to catch it when it comes out), alternate takes and vignettes(really short documentaries). All of them are well worth the time. I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it, as well as of the genres and those who want to watch pictures set in this environment. 8/1"
Surveillance             ,Rathko,1,crime,2010,9,"How have I not heard of this movie before? Absolutely fantastic. It's difficult to review a movie by Jennifer Lynch without comparing it to the work of her father. 'Surveillance' possesses the Lynchian small town banality, stilted dialogue, awkward character dynamics, brutal violence, truly twisted killers, and generally off-kilter weirdness that you'd expect. But despite the stylistic similarities, the two are very different filmmakers. 'Surveillance' has a far more traditional structure with a familiar art-house/indie conceit of multiple perspectives and unreliable narrators. The central mystery is expertly revealed through the eyewitness accounts of several individuals, slowly building the sense of dread to a knock-out last act revelation that doesn't disappoint. One of the best thrillers in recent years and deserving of a much larger audience. More than enough evidence that Jennifer Lynch is a talent in her own right."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,TKoote,1,misc,2008,8,"I went to see this movie without any knowledge of the RAF. I wasen't even born when the RAF was active. Still I could follow the story of the movie because, even though some figures are vague and get no introduction, the most important story lines are explained.The movie follows the beginning, top and ending of the first RAF-members; Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof in particular. The rest of the group doesen't get the big introduction Ulrike got but with so many interesting characters the film would get even longer then its 2.5 hours.That is inmediatly the biggest problem with the film; it's length. Because of the variety of events and characters, Der Baader-Meinhof complex never gets boring, but at some point in the movie you start to get irritated by the new events. It would be more wisely if the director had chosen to make a sequel, sothat the second RAF-members get the attention they deserve.So why 8 out of 10 stars? Simple, as an action-movie this is brilliant. The story is good and the movie doesen't tell more than it has to. The biggest achievement however is in my point of view the political statement. It doesen't make it. Der Baader-Meinhof complex tells the story of the RAF, but never approves the actions of the group, but also doesen't disapprove them. And that is a great achievement."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,JimSuhy,0,drama,2008,1,"This summary subject came from a review in the LA Weekly. It was so funny I thought you might appreciate it. Honestly this film was ridiculous. The ending was so un-intendingly funny that I couldn't stop laughing. I thought she was going to actually inhale the baby Benjamin into her womb to complete the cycle. There were many things about this film that was just plain stupid, but having to have Brad pit go back to the actual infant form was just insane. I keep trying to figure out why when a white baby was raised by a black mother in the 20's, 30's and on wasn't ever an issue with anyone in a very racist town like New Orleans in the south. It was never an issue in the film. If you like seeing plastic faces or shamelessly trying to get you get a tear in your eye with nonsense character development then this might be the film for you... Or not.... "
21             ,compaq24,0,crime,2008,1,"Before making a movie about blackjack and card counting it would have been a good idea to read some of hundreds of books on this subject available in any major bookstore. That would have prevented the creators of this movie to look like a bunch of ignorant fools totally lacking even general knowledge of the game of blackjack, card counting and casino's countermeasures. Here is why:1. Nowadays blackjack is played with 4-6-8 deck shoes cut in the middle (or 2/3 at best), which makes the player's edge (if any) so small, that making any profit is mathematically possible only in the long run. It means that no matter how favourable the count is, you chances of winning a particular hand are increased by such a small percentage, that before making any profit you may be losing many hands and even suffer substantial financial losses. Only if you are ready for losing streaks in the process and patient, and if you don't make mistakes with count and basic strategy, you may be winning in the long run. Coming to Vegas for a weekend and making fortune by winning all the time is an absolute nonsense.2. To prevent card counters from making money casino's security personnel do not abduct them in the middle of a crowded casino, torture them in the back office and take away their winnings - casinos simply ban card counters. Casinos in the US are legally private clubs: they don't charge admission fee and it's up to them to decide who will be allowed to enter the club. Since card counting is not illegal (it's just a skill), nor casino security, nor law enforcement can arrest anybody for it without serious consequences like losing casino license and possibly serving jail time. Not all casinos ban card counters, but those which don't changed blackjack rules to the degree that card counting would not overcome house edge.3. Besides blackjack related issues a person who keeps more than 300 grand cash in his dorm room can only be seen as a complete idiot. Obviously depositing this money in a bank account in the US could have caused problems with IRS, money laundering regulations, etc., but renting a bank safe deposit box could have solved the problem altogether. The image of a brilliant MIT student acting like a retard doesn't make any sense and makes me question the intellectual level of the screenplay writers.Conclusion: stay away from this movie - don't degrade yourself by watching it."
College Road Trip             ,hb-boyd,1,adventure,2009,10,"I hesitated for a very long time to watch this flick because I was convinced it was a stinker but to my surprise it was very funny. I thought the chemistry amongst the cast was excellent and helped a lot too. So many times you watch these films and the family is so poorly cast but I thought all the actors they got for the roles were a perfect match (even the actress that played Martin Lawrence's mother). When I saw in the previews that the family had a crazy pet pig I thought it was ridiculous and silly, but once you watch the film you quickly fall in love with the cute piggy. I don't think there is anything awful about this film, it's a harmless good time. In my opinion, it also had a very good message about parenting, being a teenager these days and understanding each other. So few films have valuable family messages to take away from them. And from time to time you might actually find yourself tearing up at the sentimental parts unless you're cold-hearted. Frankly, after watching this I don't get the hate other reviewers and critics have towards the film. I can't remember the last time I've seen a really good teen movie - they make so few that are actually worth viewing. It's also one of the few recent Martin Lawrence films I've enjoyed from beginning to end. And Donny Osmond was TOO funny! This should be must-see for parents whose kids will be leaving and going away to college and are finding it hard to let go. Watch this Disney movie with the whole family and have a good laugh.

Kisses             ,jdesando,1,drama,2010,NA,"'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."" Bob DylanShort, bleak, and brilliantKisses is an Irish picaresque of two 11 year-old working class kids, Kylie and Dylan, escaping at Christmas time abusive relatives from each one's home. Their odyssey takes them the streets of inner-city Dublin, where Kylie is abducted by rapists and Dylan discovers his love for her as he fights the devils, who indeed are people, not the mythical ""Sack Man"" they've feared in their neighborhood horror lore.The titular motif plays as an ironic reminder that life can give monstrous and beautiful at the same time: kisses that signify the unbridled lust of an uncle or a gift, the only thing one has, between two kids who have yet fully to understand the ambivalence. One ""ting"" is certain-- there is some beauty in the outer world: the immigrant dredge-boat driver, who gives them a ride to the city, is playful while he gets them happily to work for him as he introduces them to Dylan's namesake through a song (see above) that speaks of offering shelter from a storm.Filmmaker Lance Shelby has done the difficult by extracting love from an unforgiving landscape, like Mike Leigh's kitchen sink blokes caught in the suburbs with no one to save them yet finding hope in small gestures, like kisses, that cost little but mean much. Shelby's transition from black and white boondocks to color inner-city is too much of a cliché to be praised, but the black and white is effective as metaphor for the colorless world of the poor burbs.While the families are over the top also, or at least too unbelievably oppressive and crude, from the children's point of view, they are the devil until the kids meet the real one in the abductor/rapist. Lessons are to be learned even if the classroom is the school of hard knocks. After all, just north of them Irish have been killing Irish for decades.""There's no devil. Just people."" Kyl"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,pc95,0,drama,2012,6,"Maybe not as bad as some movies, but definitely with a Wonder Years type feel to it, Dennis Lee's ""Fireflies in the Garden"" is by-and-large clichéd melodrama. It has some redeeming scenes many of which are with Ryan Reynolds and the young child actors on-hand, but the story seems a retread - as though we've seen it before. We've seen variations done better in other movies. The music is sometimes OK folksy but sometimes cruddy folksy and annoyingly maudlin. The older and younger ""Aunt"" in the movie look way too far apart in appearance to be remotely believable. The sources of tension between the father and son are never patched up even as the credits roll down. OK for a single viewing, but doesn't make it above melodrama eithe"
Shutter             ,amanda-my-lum,0,horror,2008,1,"What really pains me is this movie does absolutely no justice to the original version. Watch the original Thai version. It is MUCH better in terms of plot, pace, suspense and horror. Instead of relying on the cheap, predictable *suspenseful music-BANG* Hollywood ploys very evident in this version, the original Thai version is very well built up, takes its time to set the mood and let the suspense and horror just seep in, and they also manage to throw in a bit of black humour as well (the public toilet visit late at night - classic). The background and development of characters in the original is MUCH better, and more plausible (with a more plausible explanation for why she turns up in photos - not this ""spirit photography"" crap), not to mention the acting is infinitely superior in the original.Hollywood fails once again.

Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,janiceferrero,0,misc,2009,8,"A film to admire but impossible to love. Not an ounce of humanity to cling on to. Splendidly put together but only with the intellect so, for non Italians a puzzle that seems like a figment of someone's imagination and to be taken as a sort of intellectual metaphor. How can a creature from hell in good terms with the Catholic Church can survive all this years and when I say survive I mean survive from every possible angle. Italians know that is not only true but normal. I'm half Italian so I know what I'm talking about. Andreotti is played by Paolo Servillo in a performance that is part caricature, part faithful portrait, a work of genius and I suspect that the slightly surreal, grotesque undertones, allowed the movie to be made and succeed in the way it did, at least in Italy. I saw it in New York where I was the only spectator in the theater. I can't wait to see where director Sorrentino will take us next."
The Merry Gentleman             ,amarcordforever,,crime,2009,8,"In a recent trend, the film going public has favored a cinematic experience of what I like to call ""Hand it Overs"". These phenomena can be as creative as the ""big reveal"" at the end of early M. Night Shymalan films, or as effortless in reality as passing the mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving dinner. They give the majority of today's audiences exactly what they want, instant gratification. Imagine if we never saw Malcom Crowe's real fate completely unfold in ""The Sixth Sense"" or Elija Prince's true self-revealed in ""Unbreakable"". How would this change our perception and enjoyment of them? The Merry Gentleman marks Michael Keatons Directorial debut by chance due to the sudden illness of screenwriter Ron Lazzeretti who was originally slated to Direct. Keaton also stars as Frank Logan, a depressed hit man, alongside Kate Frazier (Kelly Macdonald) a woman who has just escaped from an abusive relationship. As the plot unfolds, Frank and Kate end up mysteriously crossing paths, which spawns an unconventional, often uncomfortable and strained romance between these two mixed up individuals from different worlds.Keaton's first shot at direction does everything but fall into a ""Hand It Over"". His pacing is agonizingly slow, yet unbelievably careful. Discerning and seasoned viewers will appreciate his intricate placement and organization of scenes for the greater purpose, if not during the film then certainly after the credits roll. Others will become fed up with his unconventional style a third of the way through, and if they haven't walked out of the theater before the final scene may let out a strained, ""That's It?"" and huff out the door unsatisfied. For me it took a good fifteen minutes after the picture ended before everything clicked and I was blindsided by the sheer brilliance of what I had seen; deep themes rich in symbolism of religion and redemption and the overall feeling that Keaton felt no responsibility as an artist to spell it out for us.Performances all around play it safe but are always believable and gratifying to watch. As a virtual no name, Macdonald holds her own quite well, even while sporting an Irish accent that can sometimes border on a tad annoying and contrived. In front of the camera, Keaton never fails to please and continues to frustrate me when I realize that he has been almost entirely absent from view since the mid nineties. Supporting cast gets the job done and Bobby Cannavale delivers a poignant, gripping and short-lived scene stealing performance as Kate's boyfriend.The question that will remain on many of our minds is, ""what exactly is the fine line between complete obscurity and masterpiece, and did Keaton cross it?"" That's for each of us to decide individually, but it is in the opinion of this reviewer that said line is imaginary. As an art form, film should have no boundaries, regardless of how many cookie cutter, ""How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days"" burnt offerings Hollywood Studios continuously try to force down our throats. After all is said and done, it does feel good to sink your teeth into a double quarter pounder, but on occasion, Yellow Tail Sashima can prove to be extremely rewarding. After all, grandma always said try everything once."

As a matter of fact, for the first half hour or so, I thought we were being treated to a different take on ""Ararat"", Egoyan's (quite great) film from a few years back dealing with yes, Religion, persecution and customs. But then the film takes a bit of a left tum, gets a little talky and preachy, and ends on an interesting note. In the film, a teacher encourages a student to make up a story about his Dad being a terrorist and how he got his Mom to bring a bomb on a plane for him. only to be stopped by customs. The story takes a life of it's own, affecting everyone around him, why would the teacher do this?

Again, it gets to be a bit much, but under Egoyan's touch, is certainly watchabl"
21             ,jake-179,0,crime,2008,1,"This movie was exactly what I thought it would be. A boring plot, no interesting characters, and ""paint-by-numbers"" direction. Mainly this movie just lacked a compelling plot. It was just BORING. I figured it would boring, but I saw it anyway just because nothing else was playing at the time.Aside from being totally boring, there was one particular error that really bothered me. The characters throughout the movie are visiting a variety of casinos in Las Vegas. All kinds of different casinos on the strip, and some of the casinos that are nowhere near the strip, such as the Red Rock Casino. However, no matter where they go, Lawernce Fishburn's character is watching them, and happens to be at the casino they are in no matter when they are there. How did he magically transport himself around the entire Las Vegas valley like that? It was really obvious that the movie makers did not take this into consideration. They just expect you to believe the Fishburns character is inside every casino at all times.Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the geographic setting of the casinos. I live in Vegas, so I know that the Hard Rock casino is NOT located on the strip, as it was depicted in the movie.Anyway, this movie sucked, I hated it, and I wish I had not wasted my time seeing it. So, take my advice, and go see a different movie. Hopefully one that has a decent plot."

The plot however wasn't. It starts off with some promise, the life of the young brothers bloom. As one commentator mentioned, the characters deep wants and desires and their interaction with each other is developed in detail. However, what faults this movie is it's not in the least believable. You see, there are some things in the movie that should've been explained.They are not necessary for the character development but they are essential to explain some of the events that happened which help advance the plot and even to explain how and why the end was as it was. I think that the screenwriters spent enough time on character development and they had great actors to back that up but such little time on the plot and its cohesion that it lacks believability.Could've been good .."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,mpcaulfield,0,animation,2008,1,"This movie fails on every level. It begins with, I kid you not, the announcer from The Powerpuff Girl's voice replacing the opening crawl we've come to know and love, presumably because the target audience, American children, can't read at even that glacial pace. I don't know if it's even necessary at this point to say something as redundant as ""this movie has a horrible script and stiff acting;"" that's just something we've come to expect with Star Wars in the last decade. But even the battle sequences aren't enjoyable. Star Wars used to be the cutting edge in visual effects; apparently the makers of this movie haven't the ways in which computer animation have advanced in the last decade. The character animations in this movie are worse than the average video game. The movie has off-putting pacing, packing too much into the first half, and dragging in the second. Everything that was supposed to be funny was a dud, and everything that was supposed to be serious garnered unwelcome guffaws from the audience. I have nothing good to say about this movie.The consensus seems to be that it's not fair to compare it to the real Star Wars movies because it's intended for kids. That's just the thing though; I don't want Star Wars to become something that I have to put my brain on ice to enjoy from now on. A long time ago, George Lucas was capable of putting out material that kids and adults could both enjoy, that fanboys and the casual moviegoer could both enjoy, and no one would have to suspend their sensibilities to have a good time. That's what I want back. 2"
Twilight             ,black_heart_night,1,misc,2009,3,"Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great. 3"
Summer Hours             ,runamokprods,1,drama,2011,8,"Interesting, gentle sad (but not depressing) story of the inevitability of loss and chance.Three siblings decide whether to keep or sell their mother's country home and art collection after her death, exploring how we give 'things' meaning, and how that meaning changes due to context, generation, and what we need from them. But while the ideas are intriguing, and the acting good it never quite reached the deepest level of feeling or thoughtfulness for me. Called a masterpiece by a number of critics, and something close by others, I cant quite go there, but it is an intelligent, quietly moving experience, that I'll probably revisit yet again, since it grew on me on a second viewin"
Space Chimps             ,heller1120,,animation,2008,2,"I just took my 4 year old boy to see this movie and we left shortly before it was over. We were not the only ones to leave early either. Only once was there any laughter from the audience. I thought most of the punch lines were aimed at the adult audience, but no one was laughing. I was very disappointed that there wasn't any moral to the story - if there was, it was vague. The characters were not all that likable either. I didn't feel any connection to them at all, nor did my son. I left the theater thinking that this was the biggest waste of time and money. Space Chimps is no Shrek. This has to be the worst G-rated movie I have ever seen. My son thought it was very boring and he usually loves action/adventure movies. The only thing he liked about the whole experience was the pack of Twizzlers I bought him. "
Wanted             ,tyler4837,1,action,2008,1,"I was a bit apprehensive about this film from the previews and commercials, what with the bending bullets and all, but I figured with all of the action movies trying to outdo each other...maybe there would be a good story backing it. However, in the opening sequence, when a man leaps several hundred feet to slay some assassins on another rooftop before being aced out from miles away, I started to lose any hopes for a good movie. Then any further hopes were dashed when it was revealed that a magic god loom delivers a binary code that says who is to be killed (how the frat discovered binary and secondly, that the people named were to be killed is beyond me, maybe god/fate/whatever wrote to them in binary on the first sweater that was and told them to kill the named ever thereafter) This whole god/fate (fate being spelled out when the explosive rat truck hit the mill door) loom thing really blatantly pointed out the problems with dogmatic, irrational beliefs that can be found running rampant throughout our society; but speaking of that society, it's a shame to think that most people will be unable to find that point because it was buried behind quack gimics and special effects. This movie made Crank look like the Godfather. Aside from the absurd story backing why the frat was assassinating people, all of the stunts were merely an attempt to outdo movies like crank with time/space bending cg that makes anyone who has any inkling of what physics are want to cry. If the time-slowing gimics were cut from the movie, I think it would have maybe passed 30 minutes of film time. I could maybe understand the rapid heartbeat to be able to react quicker to things, modeled after a fight or flight type of response on crack or something, but the bullet bending thing got to be a little too ridiculous by the end where a bullet can be fired around a 20' circumference and have the same gun tossed to someone else before the bullet returns from its 360 degree trip to kill the shooter...I mean, really? I really wanted to walk out of the theater about 30 minutes into this film. There isn't enough room in this comment box to enable me to voice the downfalls of this film. However I feel as though I must include this side note on society as well. On top of whole fate and immovable beliefs tangent from above, the fact that movies like this can go over well in America is a great example of how dumbed down culture is making us...Oh let's make an action movie with a loom that dictates who should live and who should die...oh yea...and the assassins can bone physics with no rationale as to how...It truly made me sick. ""What luck for rulers that men do not think."" - Adolf Hitler. It's understandable how we get leaders like George W Bush when movies like this are not only accepted, but admired. Now if you will excuse me, I need to read my binary sweatshirt for what to eat tonight. 3"
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,Desertman84,0,misc,2011,10,"Il Divo is a mesmerizing Italian biographical drama film about former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreottia,a seven-time prime minister of Italy notorious for his alleged ties to the Mafia.The story spans the period from Andreotti's seventh election in 1992, to his failed bid for the presidency of the Italian Republic, to the Tangentopoli bribe scandal, until his trial in 1995.It stars Toni Servillo as Andreotti, together with Anna Bonaiuto,Piera Degli Esposti,Paolo Graziosi,Giulio Bosetti,Flavio Bucci,Carlo Buccirosso and Cristina Serafini.Also,it was written and directed Paolo Sorrentino.After watching this film,I was astonished on Sorrentino's ability to combine probably even surpass The Godfather saga as it a smart political film that features a fascinating villainous politician.This is a spectacular story about corruption in high places and absorption of great knowledge in Italian politics.While the web of corruption in this political thriller can be hard for a non-Italian to follow, the visuals and the intrigue are compelling and thrilling in equal measure as director Sorrentino avoids the dreary conventions of the biopic in favor of a cheeky mix of music montages, dramatic re-enactments and great musical score that gives the movie and the viewer energy and vitalit"
Ghost Town             ,paudie,0,misc,2008,7,"I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy ""Ghost Town"" as much as I thought I would. The performances from Gervais, Leoni and Kinnear are very good. Perhaps it is because the film never really strays from the familiar romcom path, when there was an opportunity to do something different. Gervais' character's transformation from obnoxious dentist to successful wooer of Leoni is a little too easy. And another thing, why isn't he locked up for repeatedly carrying on conversations with invisible people in public? There are a couple of very funny moments,such as the postoperative conversation between Gervais, the surgeon(Saturday Night Live's Kristen Wiig) and her lawyer.So if you're in the mood for a few laughs, (only a couple of them belly laughs ) rent Ghost Tow"
College Road Trip             ,puffball97,1,adventure,2008,5,"I have never seen a Martin Lawrence movie before, and this movie did make me into a new fan. I have seen his material here and there, but his material never has grabbed me. But today, I went with my mother and my eight-year-old niece to see ""College Road Trip."" I fully expected to be disappointed, but it turned out to be okay for me. Not the best and not the worst, but entertaining here and there.The story goes that Raven Symone is Melanie, who aspires to become a lawyer at Northwestern University in her hometown suburban Chicago, but gets a letter of acceptance to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Her three girlfriends are going, and she wants to go to. But her father James (Lawrence) fears losing his little girl, and wants to accompany her on the trip. Tagging along is her little brother Trey and their pet pig Albert, who hide in the trunk the first quarter of the journey. That leaves behind Mom Michelle (Kym Whitley).On the way, they stop at Northwestern University, and who do they run into - Donny Osmond as Doug Greenhut and Molly Ephraim as his daughter Wendy. Both have the same exact aspirations - She wants to go to Georgetown and he tags along with her. And when James and Melanie make pitstops, Doug and Wendy end up at those same stops. Doug and Wendy's annoyingly overperky behavior and singing and dancing are the highlights of this movie. They are so loud they make James and Melanie cringe, but they always pop up at the same stops. And when James' car breaks down, they get into Doug and Wendy's truck. But my real favorite part is when they lose Doug and Wendy along the way, get on a bus, and get all the Asian tourists to sing and dance to Frankie Smith's 1981 hit, ""Double Dutch Bus."" As James and Melanie get closer, they visit James' mother in Pittsburgh, and James gets to come to terms with his long lost mother about letting go of children. Finally, they sky dive all the way to Georgetown, where, who else, Wendy becomes Melanie's roommate and then the two would head to Japan.Donny Osmond and the pig do take away from Martin Lawrence's and Raven Symone's performances. The pig is funny, especially when Lawrence disguises him as a baby in a quaint hotel where no pets are allowed and then makes a big mess at a wedding taking place at that hotel. Osmond's preppy, squeaky clean, teen idol image is played to great exaggeration, his character's wife and daughter add to the perkiness. But Martin Lawrence and his family are sadly undermined by Donny Osmond and the pig, which is the film's major weakness. For 83 minutes, it is not super slow, it does go fast, but there are bumps and curves along, and then there is forced sentiment, when Melanie finally gets to say goodbye to her parents, amid the manic craziness. Martin Lawrence, like many comedians of his generation who turn to movies, is more of a comedian and less of an actor whose performances often resort to overacted slapstick."
Kisses             ,razmatazern,1,drama,2010,NA,"Kisses is an entertaining and unique film. It was interesting to watch the story of two Irish kids that run away from home unravel. Experiencing the journey with them is thoroughly enjoyable and exciting, yet believable and did not seem far-fetched.I loved the character of Kylie. Her very expressive spirit definitely added to the storyline and made for an interesting character. Dylan's apathetic, yet pensive essence was a nice contrast to Kylie's character. The acting by Kelly O'Neill and Shane Curry was remarkable, and they definitely need to be commended.The mood of the film was directly correlated with the music, and fortunately, the music was perfect to set the mood. I'm glad that I had a chance to watch it. I especially loved all of the Bob Dylan references."
WALL·E             ,ametaphysicalshark,0,animation,2008,NA,"Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10 871"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,h-rabbit,0,drama,2009,10,"This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before. Set all the way back at the end of the Great War, to New Orlean's meeting with Hurricane Katrina, this movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a baby born an old man of eighty, destined to die in the mere form of a zero-year-old. I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it. I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish. There are many emotional and touching scenes in it, including the end, where it brings forth Benjamin Button's 'younger' years as an old man. Nothing went wrong with the cast, Brad Pitt played a great job as a reverse-aging man, and Cate went well as his childhood friend. Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre. 1"
Summer Hours             ,cultfilmfan,1,drama,2009,10,"Summer Hours is a French film in French with English subtitles. It focuses on a family who do not see each other very often due to work and several of the siblings living overseas, but they are reunited and have to deal with an estate and the many belongings of one of the family members. Going through the belongings and seeing their old summer house brings back memories and has an effect on each person individually and some show it more than others and we also see how the many prized pieces of art belonging to the deceased go through being evaluated and how the siblings are going to part with them, or keep them for sentimental value. A lot of these decisions and choices and a look at a once close family who is now reunited is discussed in this film. Summer Hours is not one of your fast moving action packed films, but instead focuses a lot on characters and their lives and how they interact with the ones around them. The performances are all very strong here as is the character development and the dialogue, so for me it was an absolute joy to watch realistic characters deal with real life situations and emotions. The artistic and cultural belongings in the film that is a large focus of the story is also an interesting touch to the story because it really shows some different sides of the characters and for anyone interested in antiques, or art of any kind it is fascinating to watch seeing the impact they have on the museums and the appraisers. While the film does deal with family issues, I do want to stress that it is not a really dysfunctional family that we are observing here and it is not a depressing film to watch. On the contrary it sometimes left me quite uplifted to see how things are passed on from generation to generation and how even the simplest of things can bring back the memories of the ones we love and the times that are very dear to us. The siblings do get along and they do care for each other, but they are all older now and some have families and a lot of them have high demanding jobs and live elsewhere, so they do not really have time for each other, not because they don't care, but because their lives have taken them elsewhere, which I think is a realistic and honest way of looking at families because after all doesn't situations like this happen to us all eventually? There is definitely a lot the film leaves us to think about and I think it also allows us to appreciate our own families and the things that make them special and what brings us together and what will give us everlasting memories. Summer Hours does this without being overly sentimental, or preachy, but it still leaves the viewer with a lot to think about and to cherish about what one just watched. It left me with a peaceful and tranquil feeling and I really enjoyed watching these characters and learning more about them. A moving and intriguing tale that is one of this year's best films."
The Lucky Ones             ,BernardoLima,,adventure,2010,NA,"The Lucky ones concerns three Iraq War soldiers who have just returned to the States: Fred Cheever (Tim Robbins) is out for good, and can't wait to reunite with his wife and son in St. Louis; T.K. Poole (Michael Pena) has suffered an embarrassing injury and is on his way to reconnecting with his fiancée before heading back overseas; and the also-injured Colee Dunn (Rachel McAdams) is on a mission to deliver a precious guitar to her deceased boyfriend's parents in Las Vegas. These strangers are brought together when JFK Airport is shut down indefinitely. Deciding that renting a car is a better option than twiddling their thumbs and waiting for the planes to fly, they hit the road on an eventful journey that will bring them closer together than they ever would have expected... The Lucky Ones is a film that doesn't really make any statements about the war. Instead it's a character study of these 3 soldiers and it shows how the return from war can be weird and bizarre. The film handles some very dramatic subjects but, always in a light way. As in every road trip film, the character's journey is full of chance encounters and misadventures, and each one of the soldiers ends up fighting some of their own demons or coming to certain realizations. Granted, some of the events feel a bit contrived, but this is a dramedy, not a realistic war drama. The film was very well acted starting with Michael Pena, who despite doing mostly small roles, was a pleasant surprise as a central character. The veteran Tim Robbins delivered a good, even if subtle, performance as the older soldier who's life becomes upside down. However the film belongs to the gorgeous Rachel McAdams; she was feisty, charismatic and overall, just great, as she usually is. One cannot help but to fall a little bit in love with her every time she does a film. At the end of the day, The Lucky Ones is a quirky little film with a certain gentleness that works mainly, because it focuses on the characters and their emotions and not on the war and it's motives. Definitely a nice watch.7/10"
Good Dick             ,marktitan,1,misc,2010,8,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is not about a troubled young woman and a hopeless video guy. It is about any couple who meet and overcome their neuroses enough to be able to get along and open up to each other. Usually people abandon their partner too soon, before the rough edges have been knocked off, and smoothed out enough to become livable.Yes, it is a story of support, unfailing love, and belief that helped Mariana Palka's character deal with her past, and finally face the present.But who doesn't carry problems from the past with them? And who's spouse doesn't exhibit issues that arise from childhood challenges.That's why i love this movie: I can totally relate to it, and like Jason Ritter's character, i know that we can help our spouse as they help us. It takes time, patience, and love, lots of it.If you are perfect, and have had perfect partners, then you won't understand this movie. However, if you are human, with the usual foibles and have had relationships with other humans, you will find something rewarding about this unusual portrayal of a very usual human conditio"
A Christmas Tale             ,harry_tk_yung,1,comedy,2009,NA,"When I watched director Arnaud Desplechin's ""Kings and queen"", I was most impressed by the richness of its contents. ""A Christmas tale"" is also rich in contents but in a different way. Rather than multiple plot lines, the story evolves around a simple family reunion at Christmas. As the film unfolds, what starts as a blur comprising a group of strangers (to the audience) gradually develops outlines and shapes until at the end, what has been revealed in relationships and human nature is no less complex than in ""Kings and queen"". Instrumental to this marvellous cinematic experience is an ensemble of top-notch actors, with top-notch performances. Catherine Deneuve plays Junon, the pivotal point of this ordinary dysfunctional (no oxymoron intended) family, a woman who years ago lost his 6-year-old son Joseph to a rare genetic ailment. After several decades, she now falls victim to the same disease, and has less than six months to live unless she gets a bone marrow transplant from a family member. One of the purposes of the reunion is to find such a donor. It turns out that only two are compatible. Junon, however, faces her predicament with calm stoicism and isn't even sure if she wants the treatment. Jean-Paul Roussillon won a Caesar for Best Supporting by playing Abel, her supportive and understanding husband. He is also a firm rock and a safe harbour for family members (four children, their spouses and offspring) who are emotionally troubled. The two older children, Elizabeth and Henri, had hated each other since childhood, partly because neither was compatible with Joseph to provide bone marrow transplant to save their dying brother. Their respective characters also flamed the antagonism. Elizabeth, played by Anne Consigny is serious and multi-talented. Henri, played by Mathieu Amalric, is the black sheep of the family, always obnoxious, a drifter and a womanizer. But it turns out that Henri is one of the only two compatible family members for the transplant. The other is Elizabeth's teenage son, Paul (played by Emile Berling), an introvert, sensitive young man and a schizophrenia patient. Abel and Junon's other two surviving children are boys. Laurent Capelluto plays Simon, taciturn, reasonably well liked but undistinguished and still single. While Junon likes Henri least (not surprisingly), the apple of her eyes is the youngest son Ivan, played by Melvil Poupaud, handsome, fun-filled, happily married to beautiful wife Sylvia, with two lively little boys (played by Thomas Obled and Clement Obled). Sylvia, played by Chiara Mastroianni, then stumbles across a little secret that the two brothers had both been in love with her, and agreed between themselves that Ivan was to go ahead. While this does not change anything, Sylvia will now always wonder why is it that her life had to be decided for her, and how it would have been if she were allow to make a free choice. Her relationship with Simon takes a subtle change. Contributing to the complex world of emotions and nuances is Henri's latest girlfriend Faunia, played by Emmanuelle Devos. As she is Jewish, she has never intended to spend Christmas with the family. But while initially reluctant, she ends up spending two days there before leaving on Christmas Eve to join her own folks. What's more, Faunia's open and honest personality brings a measure of healthy impact to his troubled family, particularly, Junon. Completing the ensemble is Elizabeth's husband Claude (Hippolyte Girardot) and another guest, an elderly lady who is an old family friend (Francois Bertin). From the above summary, it can be easily surmised how immense the dramatic opportunities could be. This potential is fully realized by an excellent director and an impeccable cast. The only other thing I would add is that the entire tone of this film is cheerful, emotional moments notwithstanding."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,tomgillespie2002,0,misc,2011,8,"Il Divo charts the vast and eventful reign that former Italian prime- minister Giulio Andreotti had over Italy. He served as prime minister a number of times between 1976 and 1992, and also held positions of Defence Minister and Foreign Minister. During this time he was widely believed to have strong links to the Mafia, and was placed on trial in the late 1990's for his involvement in the murder of a journalist who was suggested to have held documents that strongly implicated Andreotti in criminal activities. The film jumps back and forth in time, and shows Andreotti's enigmatic presence of almost divine levels, and his guilt over his refusal to negotiate in the kidnapping and eventual murder of fellow Christian Democrat Aldo Moro.This is no ordinary biography. It is an unconventional, highly stylised comedy-drama that is infuriating, exciting, informative and exhausting. Director Paolo Sorrentino throws so many facts, figures and names at you in rapid fashion that it all becomes a blur, it is near impossible to keep up, especially if your knowledge of Italian politics around this time is slim (which was the case for me). But it eventually becomes clear that all this information is irrelevant. It's simply a way to show just how involved Andreotti was virtually everything that happened. He was so influential, so powerful that nothing escaped him. And nothing could touch him.Toni Servillo's simply brilliant performance conveys everything you need to know about Andreotti. He is not physically intimidating, but instead he is hunched, softly-spoken and extremely strange-looking. But Andreotti does not need to move for anyone. His extreme intelligence and near-supernatural ability to get out of situations by doing next to nothing only increases his divine status. We see the best and worst of Andreotti, but Sorrentino is not trying to force an opinion of him out of us, but instead he has directed an outrageous film about an outrageous man. 'Il Divo', literally translated, means 'the star', but suggests 'the divine one', and was the nickname given to Julius Caesar.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.c"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,Bobaby5,1,misc,2008,9,"I feel this movie was really good. I remember when the first one came out and I was like, so lame. I eventually came around and saw it but it was okay. When I heard they were making a second one I was really happy. I think this movie had a lot of variety. At one point you would think it was going to end and then it started up again with drama. I think all of the girls are amazing in this and I like that the movie wasn't generic. I noticed there were some plot twists that could have gone the usual way in that the characters win but it wasn't always like this. I give the movie a nine compared to the eh, 7 I would give to the first."
Frost/Nixon             ,MairegChernet,0,misc,2009,10,"Frost/Nixon is one of the best film of the year, and certainly a strong contender for best picture. Langella's marvelous performance as the bedazzled Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen's terrific portrayal of the rigorous David Frost combined with Ron Howard's magnificent direction make the movie a memorable one. Not only that but the supporting cast- including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Matthew MacFayden and Olvier Platt- was also phenomenal. Frost/Nixon is an epic, an epic that involves not guns and human sacrifices but words and tense emotions. It's also a historically significant film, for all who crave to know what really happened and whether or not Nixon didn't ""obstruct any laws."" In short Frost/Nixon is an amazing film filled with sharp dialogues, amazing performances and tense and provocative sentiments as well as an explosive yet subtle ending.10/10 Go see it!"
The Objective             ,ebobrow,,horror,2008,5,"I just got back from the World Premiere at the Tribeca film festival and this film was just all over the place. It starts off really good with tension between the characters as they try to connect a little. They basically start off on a journey through Afghanistan to find a person the locals consider holy and god like. They travel and travel until they reach a spot where an RPG is fired by the enemy at their direction. A small and quick fire fight leads to a death and the death of a lot of the enemy, strangely, the bodies cannot be found. I will stop with the spoilers there because that one is only minor and slightly affects the story.Next, our characters continue to try to find this mysterious person but soon, one by one, they discover something that should have never been found.The film did get a few jumps that I saw especially in this scene where during night time they are watching headlines on a road, suddenly, they split up and fly into the night sky. Fricken weird.At around the half way point, the film started to get worse and worse. The dialog sounded bad and forced like they weren't even trying. I know, working on a schedule of 24 days is tough but they should have practiced more.Next, the film keeps transitioning from night time to day time, like, every scene which is really annoying after the 10th time.Next, there are so many fricken plot holes that I just can't list them all. They leave out very important parts of the 1 hour and 30 minute film that really could've helped.It was slow. Plain and simple. The last half made the movie feel like it was a 2 hour film when it was only 1 hour and 30 minutes. It took its time which made it kinda worse.The gore is very minimal BTW. Only one really bad scene showed in the trailer. The enemy is -well- not scary. Not at all. Kinda weird more so. The don't explain its origins. They don't explain why it doing what it is. It does does what he wants.The characters are literally the dumbest characters I have ever seen with times where they would miss crucial moments or just not care. Like in a fight scene we see two guys fighting. Then a shot of a character looking on, not doing anything. Then fighting again and that guy is breaking the fight up. And there is a huge part in the end that is really big that made me say ""You should have looked!!"" Finally, the huge problem. The ending. The director didn't know how to end this film. He even said it himself after it was over. It was strange, confusing, and so messed up that I left the theater with a big ""WTF just happened?!"" look. Also, the trailer shows just about every good part of the movie so don't be surprised when you think you should be.I have it a 5 because it had some good parts (beginning) but a lot of somewhat bad parts too"
Australia             ,mocpacific,1,adventure,2008,3,"I think the best word to describe this pastiche is ""ridicolous"" and not in a fun, entertaining way. Baz Luhrmann's ego is all over the screen but there is no visible sign of his intellect. ""Somewhere over the rainbow""? Oh please, give me a break! Although the story is the wannabe love story between a man and a woman the whole thing feels incredibly camp and not in a fun, entertaining way. If I sound angry it may be because I am. I sat for three hours! Three hours! To be told this quilted compilation of other much better movies. Nicole Kidman is always fun to watch and that is true also here but for the wrong reasons. Hugh Jackman gets the most loving, sexy framings and close ups. I'm giving ""Australia"" a 3 and not a 1 due to the young Aborigine star and some spectacular locations. 1"

The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,geoffgee,1,misc,2008,8,"Although being somewhat more than moderately interested in politics, I knew very little about the original activities on which this film is based. Having seen the film, I now feel vastly more knowledgeable on how world events in the late sixties and early seventies led from the emergence to the demise of this particular left wing faction. My attention was fully engaged throughout the film. I thought the screenplay brilliantly portrayed the way the mindset of the RAF developed as they became more and more convinced they were living in a police state. Acting and direction were superb throughout. In spite of the violence and repression being depicted, I was reassured by the fact that such thought provoking films can and are being made for today's cinema audiences. After seeing Die Welle (I think it was three times) earlier this year I am now very enthusiastic about German cinema and shall certainly be hoping to see Der Baader Meinhof Komplex at least once more on the big screen this year. A masterpiece of political film making. Highly recommended."
Igor             ,marcusdean118,0,animation,2008,3,"A great voice cast is wasted here. The jokes were not funny. What is an animation without a few laughs? I couldn't count the number of punch lines that went down with silence in the theatre, and this was one packed with kids! The idea is not too bad if not heavily influenced by other work. Cleese is not in it much, but he wasn't particularly funny when he was in it. To waste Cleese is a sin, but to waste Cleese, Izzard and Buscemi is something else.The animation is annoying as we have seen so much better from Pixar. If this film had been given to Brad Bird, we would have seen a better and more successful movie. With this version i was only left with the question. Would this of ever been made without Tim Burton"
Good Dick             ,akadoll,1,misc,2010,10,"I read multiple reviews on several different websites. Unfortunately, it received approximately 50% negative. The release date was last year, but my friends had not heard of this movie. I did get a kick out of saying the title. After watching the trailer, I decided to give it a try. Well, I am celebrating my download. This is on i-tunes for purchase and/or rent. There are a few disturbing moments, but I really enjoyed the acting, plot, and music. This film is about humanity and the power of supportive relationships. My favorite quote: I love you and this fight is over. Go for it, this one is worth seeing. I hope this film receives more attention. The acting is so real; I did not want this to end. Do not let the title prevent you for watching, it really is a great film. I am so tired of the same type of movie and this was off the pattern. I will keep an eye out for other films by the director, plus the actor"
The Bank Job             ,MAXMILLAIN,0,crime,2008,7,"Saw an advance screening of this 'True' British crime story last night. True is in inverted commas as apparently the basic facts are true but of course most of the story comes from the minds of the two writers that penned it.Its an enjoyable film, good story, production wise nothing special; could be a made for TV movie, there wasn't much action surprisingly and the jokes were thin on the ground; a snatch copy it 'aint.Good performance from Jason Stratham in his best screwed up, looking menacing while surprised face. Good supporting cast with many faces you will recognise (spot the Eastender) apart from a terrible performance from Stephen Campbell Moore who looked like he was on a comedy show. Thought it could have maybe done with a bit more music from the 70's, Just to cement home the era a bit more.I wouldn't bother spending money going to see this at the cinema, unless maybe its Orange Wednesday 2-4-1, more suited to a DVD viewing or wait till it hits Film Four in a year or two.Enjoyable, better than average British film, but no Oscars coming its way."
The Burning Plain             ,come2whereimfrom,1,misc,2009,7,"The writer Guillermo Arriaga, much famed for his trilogy of films with director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, namely Amores Perros, 21 grams and Babel, steps behind the camera and debuts his own directing skills with 'The Burning Plain' a multi-layered affair that at its core tries to explore how we deal with guilt. If you didn't like the style of the afore mentioned films then chances are you wont get on with this either. The story is told in interweaving flashbacks and over different time periods and does require some work on the part of the viewer. But with plot pieces trickled out like a breadcrumb trail right up to the end, a great but subtle score and some breathtaking scenery it grips you as you slowly piece it all together. Added to that there are the two brilliant central performances from Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger, as the damaged mother and daughter and a supporting cast that in their various roles are also superb especially Jennifer Lawrence who rightly won an award at the Venice Film Festival. The cinematography is great and the colours are so warm you can almost feel the Mexican heat coming out of the screen. The direction while not quite as good as Inarritu proves that Arriaga was indeed paying attention and the overall feel is eerily similar. The only downside is that it does leave certain characters stories unfinished but that really is just a minor quibble in what is a very emotionally charged and challenging film."
The Strangers             ,hall895,,horror,2012,3,"Here we have a horror movie which sadly is much more laughable than scary. The characters are stupid. The story, not that there actually is much of a story, is stupid. There are no big scares to jolt you out of your seat. Really there's nothing to prevent you from yawning or flat-out dozing off. When the movie ended I was stunned to find out it was less than 90 minutes long. It seemed much longer. It honestly feels interminable. Please just let the killers put their victims out of their misery. Then we who have the misfortune to be watching can be put out of our misery as well.So the setup is that a young couple, played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, are spending the night in some house out in the middle of nowhere. There's a knock on the door. A really, really loud knock. That's about the most chilling thing the movie has to offer, a loud knock on the door. Anyhow our young couple ends up being terrorized by three people in goofy masks. Everyone involved, goofy mask people and their potential victims, acts very stupidly. Our victims have apparently never seen any horror movies as, rather than wait in the house with the freaking shotgun they have, they decide to go running around outside in the dark. Because running around in the dark always ends well in these situations, no? Our silly mask people are very lucky that their prey are so stupid because they are quite stupid themselves. If anyone involved in this story had any working brain cells the whole thing would've been over in five minutes. And what a blessed relief that would have been. Instead it goes on and on, Liv Tyler just keeps screaming and the would-be killers just keep, well, standing there. They never really do anything. Ooh, look a guy with a bag on his face is standing in the corner! Scary, right? Nope, not really. There is no action, no drama, no tension. It's all very predictable right from the beginning, probably not helped by the fact the movie basically gives away its ending right at the start. We go through all the horror movie clichés as the movie limps meekly towards a thoroughly unsatisfying end. Boring, unoriginal, quite stupid. That's The Strangers in a nutshell."
Four Christmases             ,motherlee2001,1,comedy,2008,7,"My friend and I saw this movie tonight and did get a few laughs. We really liked the cast and thought overall the movie was ""cute"".We both noticed how Reese Witherspoon's hair kept ""changing"".. In the same clip the camera would be on her and her bangs would be straight and side-swept. Camera goes to Vince Vaughn. Camera goes back to Witherspoon and her bangs are fuller and covering her forehead. The color would change from scene to scene. It was bizarre. We laughed more at the hair issue than the movie itself. We wondered how many others in the audience noticed. It was really obvious.Clearly we are easily entertained... ;-"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,bhattrell,1,misc,2017,6,""" Promise draining away with duration. A little romance with too much complication. Not enough anecdotal inspiration. Film finds itself in a mediocre rank location.""Sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 (6.5/10)Setting the sceneImagine you are a bee ... Out on the hunt for nectar. You don't find a sweetly scented rose but end up settling on a daisy. The daisy is fine. It still provides the nectar you want but you wonder. You wonder if your fellow bees have found a flower which is more salubrious. This is the theme of the scene setting. The not knowing of characters lives and how they are unfolding. This is a capture. Gets you wanting to know more and acts as an effective hook.Main body The beginning shows real promise with many dramatic emotional scenes with 2 of the main characters. You almost expect some relationship development but nothing feels long term. It feels like nothing is real or deep enough to provide a real romance vibe. Perhaps the art of the film is it's action and progression but for this, all the scenes and characters should be as emphatic as each other. This just isn't the case. The second film learns from the issue of focusing too heavily on the main character in the first. With this though it struggles to make each small excerpt from every character dramatic. The greatest drama begins with a combination of characters. One is left out from any really emotional or engaging events. Things get a little tedious later on since the drama is siphoned just towards the main character. Only a short snippet for the left out character is provided to try to reengage or wake up the viewer. This seems a bit desperate and feeble however and some stones are left unnecessarily unturned.The main body therefore seems to fade away and could benefit from a little truncation or just quality time focusing on relationships. That said the stories do have variety but just aren't on the whole that entertaining. Music Quieter music as well as increased fading was used especially well for sadness and turmoil. This enhanced the authenticity for just one of the characters though. Again this was far more effective at the early part of the main film body but by the end was not noticeable unfortunately. In general the music was calming and relaxing which suits the films friendship vibes although perhaps needs changing up where things are threatened or more exciting. Ending The ending is too much like the first which is a shame. There could have been a twist in the tale or the significance of the pants revealed which would have been nice. Summary A varied combination lacking seasoning. Not fully reasoned and seasoned by any stretch although some good relationship scenes, location variety and number of life snippets just about get you to the end of the film. No better or worse I feel than the original but the film appears to suffer from less surprise after viewing the firs"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,seasidebuy,0,animation,2016,7,"No big action scenes, no adult humor that the kids don't understand, this is just a nice calm cartoon that you can watch with your kids before bedtime.

The scenery is pleasant. Music is calm.Parental guide, The flies use the word Crap a few times and one of the flies refers to the others as idiots.Plot is slow but it does tell a good story about the space launch that put a man on the moon.

21             ,Bighead55555,0,crime,2009,2,"Lots of badly delivered voice-overs (a lazy storytelling mechanism by the way), wooden acting, flashy cinematography, and unnecessary use of slow motion coupled with the basic plot of every Tom Cruise movie from the '80s is no substitute for a real movie. While this may be based on a real-life story, its similarity to good film entertainment ends at the point that they both use celluloid. Trite in every sense of the word, I hope Spacey got paid well as this thing certainly didn't propel his career anywhere. Nobody in the cast appeared to be trying, and the creative forces behind the camera flipped the auto-pilot switch ""on"". The Discovery Channel documentary reenactment had more dramatic punch."
Frozen River             ,sonya90028,1,crime,2008,8,"I recently saw Frozen River, at a local theater. This indie film revolves around two impoverished single mothers; one white, and the other a member of the Mohawk Native American tribe. The setting of the film takes place in the harsh, bleak climate of upstate NY, near the Canadian border during wintertime.Melissa Leo is brilliant as the haggard, world-weary single mother, Ray. Ray's gambling-addict husband, has left her and their 2 sons in the lurch. Right before Christmas, he splits with the savings that Ray had planned to use as payment, for a better trailer home than the one her family has been residing in.Ray tries in vain to support herself and her children, on income from a part-time retail job. She doesn't get the promotion to Manager, that she had expected at her job. As a result, Ray and her family are in dire economic straits; they subsist on popcorn and powdered juice, are on the verge of having their TV repossessed by a rent-to-own store, and face a Christmas without presents. Worst of all, the coveted 'double-wide' trailer home that Ray has long dreamed of purchasing, is an impossibility, without the savings that her husband ran off with.In desperation, Ray goes looking for her husband in a gambling Casino, located in Mohawk tribal territory. One of the young Native American women of the tribe, Lila (played with a dry, dour efficiency by Misty Upham) steals the car that Ray's husband had abandoned, in the Casino parking-lot. Ray sees this, and pursues Lila to her tiny trailer home, located in a remote woodsy area.Lila is also a single mom whose husband had died, and left her with a 1-year-old son to raise alone. Lila doesn't want to give Ray the car back, and doesn't respond to threats that Ray will turn Lila in to the local cops. According to Lila, white man's law is void in Mohawk territory. After a brief scuffle with Lila, Ray pulls a pistol, and shoots a hole in Lila's trailer. Frightened by this, Lila makes Ray an offer; if she lets Lila keep the car, then Ray can join Lila in her lucrative immigrant smuggling operation. Ray reluctantly agrees.This film offers-up lots of stark, yet gorgeous, moody scenery. It dovetails well, with the gripping suspense of the smuggling-runs made by Ray and Lila. They must always keep one step ahead of the local State Troopers, hope that the sleazy smuggling kingpins pay them what they are owed, and complete their smuggling-runs without the frozen river caving in.The basic premise of the film is grim, but highlights the lengths that two desperate single mothers could be driven to, in order to support their families. We need more films that address the serious plight of the working-poor, in American today. Especially films about poor single mothers, and the acute economic hardships that many of them face in today's economy.The main problem with Frozen River, is that there are some implausible plot details, throughout the film. The producers obviously wanted to make a film with lots of emotional impact, and depth. They succeeded, but also should have made sure that they smoothed-out the rough edges in the storyline. Overall though, I would recommend Frozen River. The gorgeous cinematography, and especially the strong performances by the two lead actresses, make this film worth watching."
I Sell the Dead             ,scottmannen1,,misc,2009,9,"If you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one. If you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off- then this isn't the one for you.For the budget that this movie was filmed on, the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!The story was truly well done and the director is to be commended. There is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! The acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which I am definitely holding out for! I have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic.In a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave-robber. It tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters. Vampires to Zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as simple grave-robbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who requires bodies for his medical practise. When the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the grave-robbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called the house of Murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses- and thats where both grave-robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences.This movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that I have seen in years and reminds me of the Evil Dead. Don't miss this one, you will regret it!"
Flash of Genius             ,tedg,0,misc,2009,NA,"There are all sorts of fabulous interminglings between film and life. At a general level, I study these things. But when ""life"" is meant in the sense of historical truth, and the film purports to represent that, then the examination gets a bit boring. Okay, so we have a movie where Napoleon went somewhere that we know he did not; does it matter? Sometimes we take ""life"" as fictitious life, so when Heathcliff does something not in Bronte's words we rebel.Well, here we have an ordinary movie: a triumph of the will of a little guy who earns the justice he deserves. Superficially, we follow along dutifully. We have the requisite big bad corporation who serves as the life-smashing inevitable. It plods along and we are released into the light with a relatively poor feel-good movie. Okay. Another way to fill an empty life.But the problem that this movie has, is that it is about innovation. That sets it apart from the similarly offensive ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""The Insider.""Here is the story. I will tell you so you do not have to see the movie. College professor and mechanical engineer in Detroit gets an idea for what we now call an intermittent windshield wiper. Ford steals his idea and he toils through court at substantial cost and gets a huge reward.One problem with this story is that it is not true, not the facts anyway. He did make an electrically controlled windshield wiper which allowed intermittence and several speed settings. The second of these was what he originally thought was useful. At the time, all wipers were driven by the vacuum created by the engine and were not controllable. Small electric motors were common but just becoming feasible from a cost and reliability perspective.Ford had working electric wipers for decades before. Everyone did. Once you do that, many sorts of speed and frequency issues are manageable. I know of a project that was to coordinate the wipers with the beat of the music over your radio. The radio, by the way was the reason for modernizing the electrical system in cars so they could shift many controls over that way.What Kearns did was what had already been done before and documented. Moreover, it was trivial. He submitted a patent which was granted and then several subsequent ones. These were granted too, since the patent examiner did not have access to internal documents from the car companies. When shown copious documentation, the patents were revoked. Kearns soldiered on, delusional. What paid off what that delusion. The real story was not that goodness was rewarded, but that nuisanced craziness was. Which brings us to the reflective part of the comment: the movie is like the event. It pretends to be useful, novel and true, presents itself as worthy. But it is fake, derivative, a copy, a theft from something done somewhere by someone who really did invent.Don't reward this nuisance by watching it.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life"

I have nothing good to say about this movie. It was pointless, stupid, unrealistic ( the annoying type), did I all ready say pointless? A lot of times during this movie you just zone out with the random junk they throw in, from the world and rules of a sex club to how a counting or whatever works like. I guess when I think about it there is one good thing I can say, both actors Jackman and McGregor are decent through this film. Even though I didn't even like our ""hero"" of this movie. (McGregor) all are miss leading and like I said before pointless in there actions. The ending just kills me , I yelled at how stupid it was.

Sex and the City             ,thebluebasil,1,comedy,2008,3,"The only positive thought that ran through my mind after watching the gala premiere of the film is ""Damn, that new Mercedes Benz GLK is fine.""As a series, Sex and the City was like a sliver of pan fried foie gras - cruel, taboo, but delicious. The movie, however, was as flaccid as Spam; it was entirely unsuccessful in its attempt to achieve thorough character development/portrayal in a couple of hours.Think of it this way, if you cringe at the thought of FRIENDS coming together to make a movie, SATC is exactly the same. There's simply too much history within the series that can be sufficiently revisited/covered in the movie.We get it, you have a lot of clothes, SJP and minions. But then again, even those Blahniks couldn't save you from being convincingly labelled as the world's unsexiest woman, could they? A reed thin plot, horrible ending and one dimensional acting adds up to quite a big boob at the cinemas this summer. To quote Heidi Klum, ""you're eizer in, or you're out.""

Nim's Island             ,skipmars,1,adventure,2008,1,"As a fan of Jodie Foster, I'm scratching my head over her choice to appear in this film, and am considering writing to see if she will refund the price of my ticket as well as the gas it took to drive to the theater. I won't ask for money for the sodas and popcorn, 'cause I drink/eat those at home anyway.I found the storyline plodding, cutesy, and overly manipulated.Plot elements are introduced and are dropped without explanation or resolution (e.g., Nim's festering wound and the eruption of the volcano). The resolution is overly compressed compared to the time and energy it takes to get to the climax.On the way home our carload of moviegoers put together a hilarious version of Nim's Island that includes cannibalism, prehistoric monsters (to get rid of the fat kid), and the beginnings of a cult group on the island where maidens are sacrificed in the volcano. Of course, this would remove it from the family movie genre, but it sure would have been a lot more interesting than the film we saw tonight.As with most bombs, we suggest you stay a safe distance away from this film."

Some injustice, unfathomable plot twist. To everyone's ill concealed embarrassment, Clint barks a tune during the credits -The end-Mix in some truly pathetic acting by a cast clearly let in on a sympathy vote, the worst clichés gathered from Alan Smithee's collective works, The Ultimate Anthology of Prosthetic Plot Points, and you get this yard sale of banality which is Gran Torino.If you like your drama spoon fed to you with a predictability factor that would even make a soap screenwriter blush and if you can stand Eastwood doing poor grizzly imitation while impersonating a fossilized plank of pre-Cambrian wood throughout an entire film, I guess this movie is for you.But if you're still going for something slightly original, convincing or otherwise entertaining , I can only recommend a dozen of other films that are actually worth their viewing. Go see 'The Usual Suspects' if you never got around to see it. 'Big Fish', 'Lost in Translation', 'Funny Games', 'Ground Hog Day', 'Michael Clayton' or 'The Escapist'. And bloody shame on all those professional movie critics. I mean, surely they must have HBO so they can compare this shameful dross to for instance 'The Wire' and conclude that which was actually really made for TV, is light years ahead of this straight- to-DVD clunker.Gran Torino, a score of 8.4 and a #85 place in the IMDb top 250 list.What a joke!4.5/10 1"
Space Chimps             ,www-jats,,animation,2010,2,"This CGI animated movie is not complex or sophisticated. It is a simple story of very clever chimps, full of human characteristics, being sent through a space warp to a planet full of aliens, and emerging triumphant. It is aimed at kids, although there are gags in it for adults. It is bright and colloidal, the characters (humans, chimps and aliens) are all engaging, the alien world is imaginative, the action flows well, the Decalogue is fun, and the story is easy to follow.If I sound a little half-hearted, then it's because I am. Despite all the good things listed above, the movie itself comes across as a little half-hearted. The animation, for instance, while adequate, isn't up to the standard we've become used to in CGI features. The voice cast perform OK, but aren't particularly high profile (Jeff Daniels and Stanley Tucci are the top names). And there's at least one matter which we expected to see resolved before the end, but which is still hanging loose"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,lexie491,0,animation,2009,8,"The Tale of Despereax is a wonderful tale of a brave, young mouse and his undying quest for truth, honor, and justice.I loved the many different story lines, the graphics, the storyline, the characters, and the message that it sends. I wish the movie was longer and had a more exciting plot, but all in all it was good! It made me think back when I was a kid and I used to read stories about knights and used to believe I was a knight.To the parents who saw the movie and complain that it was too scary for their kids, I have 2 things to say: 1) You raised your children poorly. Parents nowadays worry too much about their kids getting scared and try too hard to protect them from these kind of things. The world is full of scary things, anyone who does not see this is blind. And there will always be scary things your child has to face. So, while they're young, it's good to introduce them to some scary things slowly to help build their courage. If they don't learn now, how will they ever learn? (I was afraid of the dark when I was a little girl. I used to put the covers over my head and I kept a night light on in my room. Then one day, I forced myself to take the covers off my eyes, turned out the night light, and laid in the darkness. I was absolutely terrified, of course, but after a while I became brave, and now I'm not afraid.) 2) If you've read certain children's stories like Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rumpelstiltskin, there is a lot of violence (Rapunzel=prince falls into a thorn bush and has his eyes poked out. Little Red Riding Hood=the woodsman cuts off the wolf's head/slices the wolf open. Rumpelstilskin=Rumpelstilskin tears himself in half from frustration.) A lot of the stories are violent and scary when you picture it, but the reason why stories like this were told back in the old days was because they were (semi) realistic (plus, there was no censorship compared to what we have today) and it taught people to be brave, behave well, and make good decision"
Nim's Island             ,Doylenf,1,adventure,2008,6,"After watching NIM'S ISLAND, it occurred to me that Wendy Orr's children's novel would have worked much better as a Walt Disney animated feature than as a live action film with CGI effects. Animation would have provided the missing ingredient here--namely, good old-fashioned charm...and magic. The design work for the main titles led me to believe this would be an enchanting film. It wasn't.However, with a lack of good films for children to see, I wouldn't discourage younger patrons from seeing the film. It's entertaining enough for impressionable minds to appreciate--if they can understand that the Alex Roper character is really a figment of Abigail's and Jody's imagination.ABIGAIL BRESLIN is fine as the lonely island girl who has to fantasize about her pulp action hero and GERARD BUTLER is perfectly cast as her father (Jack) who goes missing for most of the story but is reunited with her--predictably--at the end after a savage storm. But I can't say I enjoyed watching JODIE FOSTER play a clumsy agoraphobic authoress in a series of scenes that had me wondering who else might have been better in that role. I came up with a younger Angela Lansbury, who knew how to do this sort of physical clumsiness with such skill and still remain charming. With Foster, the charm is gone and all you you get is a mannered amount of nerdy nervousness.Lest anyone adult should fall asleep during the proceedings, not to worry. Patrick Doyle's bombastic background score, incredibly busy even during the frenzied height of the storm scenes, is enough to make anyone pop open their eyes to see what's happening.What should have been wistful, magical, even a bit romantic, comes across as kind of brass, corny and utterly predictable nonsense with lots of credibility issues. Foster's character is among the most unbelievable characters ever created, even for a children's story.Summing up: Has its moments and it's not all bad, but too bad Butler couldn't have had more footage. His scenes as the imaginary adventurer provide the best and most humorous moments in the whole film."
Bolt             ,tavm,0,animation,2008,9,"Though my friend who works at a movie theatre had already seen this, he agreed to watch it again with me. This was a thrilling, heartwarming, and funny Disney-computer-animated movie for me. All the voices were great from John Travolta and Miley Cyrus to the rest. This story of a German Shepard who lives a ""Truman Show"" life until he accidentally escapes and meets a cat and a hamster is entertaining from beginning to end. Do yourself and your family a favor and take everyone you know to watch this highly entertaining flick. Not quite Pixar-quality but pretty close. Hope it does even better with the kids out of school this Thanksgiving weekend. So what are you waiting for, just go"
Prom Night             ,sassyprettyncute,1,horror,2008,7,"I saw it today and it was surprisingly good. It wasn't the best scary movie and since it was PG-13 they didn't show the killings that well, so I wish it was more gory and such. Also, the dialog was sometimes stupid, but the plot was good. It was really scary at parts and sad. I wish it was a little longer and explained more things better. Also Brittany Snow didn't seemed so sad when her friends and boyfriend died, her character should have cried more or have been more scared. It's called having a heart. Well anyways, I would recommend going to the theaters, it's much better at the big screens and it's not a huge waste of your money. So if you see it, it's not that bad!"
Wanted             ,c_p_c,1,action,2008,7,"Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley, and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we've seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10.

One Missed Call             ,drownnnsoda,0,horror,2008,3,"""One Missed Call"" follows a college coed named Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), whose friend, Leann (Azura Skye) dies in a freak accident after receiving a strange phone message that seems to be a recording of her death that followed two days after it was received. Not only that, but another one of Leann's friends, Shelley (Meagan Good) had a similar incident before her bizarre death. When Beth meets detective Andrews (Edward Burns), who believes there is truth to the strange events, the two team up to try and discover the source of the murderous chain of phone messages. And when Beth receives one herself, it becomes a race against time before she meets her predetermined fate as well.To get things clear in the beginning, I have not seen the original Japanese version of this film, so I cannot make a comparison between the two. However, I can say that this remake was quite a mess of a movie, regardless of whether or not the original was a good film. For one, the writing is pretty lousy. The story begins kind of all over the place before focusing on one central character, and that initial opening scare scene was flat-out ridiculous. There are dozens of plot holes scattered throughout the film, and many things that simply do not add up. It's pretty clichéd as well, relying on a never ending slew of ""jump"" scares to get a reaction from the audience - problem is, most of them are so much expected that few are even minorly effective. There is little to no suspense as well, and I felt this could have been a fairly suspenseful movie.The second area where the script fails is in the characters. We get their names, but that's about all. They have no depth, little personality, and are really overall bland, even the protagonists that we are supposed to be caring about. The acting was average, but I have a feeling the reason some of the performances lack is because the script was poorly written to begin with, and the performers had little to go on. Shannyn Sossamon leads the cast and does decent with what she has, as does Edward Burns, but neither are anything remarkable. The rest of the more minor characters are even more bland, and have even less to go on. Azura Skye is notable in her performance as Sossamon's friend, but she suffers from a poorly-written character as well. I also had a bit of a problem with the chemistry between the characters/the actors, because sometimes things just did not feel 'right'. There is some good to be found in this movie though, however little it may be. While some may bash it for it's PG-13 rating, I don't have a problem with that, because it's not a movie that needs to be gory to begin with. I also thought that the general premise was interesting, even though it is a remake. It's a neat idea, but the execution of it was horrible. I will give it the benefit of the doubt though when it comes to some of the visuals and images - there are a few creepy visuals in this movie, and the 'villians', for lack of a better term, were pretty spooky, as was the sinister ""warning"" ringtone. I thought the hospital sequence towards the end was fairly creepy - that is until we are shown a grinning monster-infant playing with a cell phone in a crib, which was not only ridiculous, but was supposed to be taken seriously. That bit ruined the good that I saw in that scene to say the least, even during that semi-scary attack by a reanimated corpse. The ending was a letdown as well, and I was really disappointed.Overall, ""One Missed Call"" is one of the worst horror films I've seen at the theater in awhile. The script is messy, the characters are bland, the scares are ineffective, there is little to no suspense - and the entire film felt like it was carelessly thrown together. It's a shame too, because the premise is interesting and this could have been a decent movie, but the filmmakers' execution of it was poor. Besides a few creepy visuals, I can't recommend much here. You'll probably want to skip this one, or wait till it comes to video. 3/10."
The Duchess             ,JamesHitchcock,1,misc,2008,7,"The marriage between Lady Georgiana Spencer and William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, was an arranged union between two of eighteenth-century England's most powerful aristocratic families. It appears to have been loveless from the start; the Duke was more interested in hunting and his dogs than in his wife, whom he only married so that she might provide him with a son and heir. He took his wife's best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster, as his mistress; the three lived under the same roof in a ménage a trois. Georgiana threw herself into her own interests- gambling and political campaigning- and eventually took a lover of her own, the handsome young politician (and future Prime Minister) Charles Grey, by whom she had an illegitimate daughter.The publicity material for this film has made much of the supposed parallels between Georgiana and her kinswoman Princess Diana, born more than two centuries later, even using the tagline ""There were three people in her marriage"", a clear reference to Diana's famous remark during her 1995 ""Panorama"" interview. There are, of course, differences. Diana, for example, was never a friend of Camilla Parker Bowles, and certainly never had a lesbian relationship with her; the film, in one very suggestive scene, implies that Georgiana and Elizabeth were more than just good friends. The film itself does not play up the Diana angle as much as the marketing campaign did, although there is one obvious reference when it is said that every man in England is in love with Georgiana, except her husband- a remark often made about Diana herself.After ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement"", Keira Knightley has inherited the office of Britain's Official Costume Drama Queen, once held by Helena Bonham Carter. (Helena has abdicated to take up the position of Tim Burton's Muse). I would not agree that this is Keira's best performance- that remains ""Atonement""- but it is nevertheless a good one. Her Georgiana is a tragic character, passionate and high-spirited, but trapped by the rigid conventions of her age and of her social class. When I first saw Keira as Lara in the television ""Dr Zhivago"" her voice and mannerisms reminded me strongly of Diana, so her casting here is perhaps appropriate. (There were three people in Zhivago's marriage as well, although in that case Lara was the Camilla-figure).Eighteenth-century female portraits, especially of aristocratic ladies, can often seem rather anonymous, revealing little of the sitter's individual personality, and I think there is a reason for this. The ostentatious fashions of the day, especially those massive, ridiculously over-elaborate wigs, seem to have been designed to draw attention, not to the looks of the woman wearing them, but to the wealth of the husband, lover or father who had paid for them. (The early nineteenth century was to see a sharp reaction against this type of fashion; Georgiana's daughters would doubtless have dressed far more simply and elegantly than their mother, allowing their individual looks to shine through). It is therefore a tribute to Keira's beauty that, even when dressed in the riotously exuberant height of Georgian fashion, she still manages to outshine the clothes she is wearing.There are good supporting performances from Hayley Attwell as Elizabeth and Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's mother, although I felt that Dominic Cooper was rather bland as Grey. Unlike one reviewer, however, I did not think he was too young for the part- indeed, if anything, he was too old. In reality Grey was seven years younger than Georgiana, whereas Cooper is seven years older then Keira Knightley. Had Grey been as old as the character shown in this film, he would have been eighty when he became Prime Minister in 1830.The real star, however, is Ralph Fiennes, often a great villain- he was the Nazi commandant in ""Schindler's List"" and Lord Voldemort in the ""Harry Potter"" films. His Duke, however, although deeply unsympathetic, is not quite a villain in that sense. He is cold and unemotional, obsessed with position and status. His extra-marital affairs- apart from Elizabeth he seduces one of the maids at Chatsworth and fathers an illegitimate daughter by her- are not motivated by love or, probably, even by lust- he is too much of a cold fish for that. They are, rather, an expression of his power- he seduces Elizabeth by offering to use his influence to help her recover custody of her children from her estranged husband. His treatment of his wife, including marital rape, is motivated by the same desire for power over others. Yet one senses in Fiennes's performance that even the Duke, as much as his Duchess, is a victim of social conventions, that he is unable to express love and other emotions because he has never learned how to do so. There is often an emotional reserve about Fiennes' acting, which in my view makes it difficult for him to play a romantic hero like Bendix in ""The End of the Affair"". (In that film I thought he would have been better as the cuckolded husband, Henry). In a part like the Duke, however, he is perfect.The film falls within the British ""heritage cinema"" tradition, although unlike most films in that tradition it is based upon historical fact rather than fiction. As with most heritage films, it aims at a faithful reproduction of the period, especially the costumes, and was filmed against a backdrop of some of England's grandest stately homes, including Chatsworth, the ancestral home of the Devonshires. (Unfortunately, their London mansion Devonshire House was demolished after the First World War, so Somerset House was used instead for the London scenes). Saul Dibb, however, seems to have been aiming for something different from the classic Merchant-Ivory ""heritage look"". ""The Duchess"" with its muted colours, is comparatively subdued; perhaps Dibb felt this was more appropriate as, for all the fine clothes on display, it is essentially a film about emotional suffering. 7/1"
Ghost Town             ,tingnting,0,misc,2008,6,"An English dentist (Ricky Gervais) living in Manhattan starts to see and hear ghosts, who won't leave him alone until he agrees to sort out a few things for them. To make things worse he is a loner / recluse who is sarcastic, offensive and completely devoid of any social skills.Similar to Jack Nicholson's character from As Good As It Gets, however being a professional comedian gives Ricky an edge when delivering all those funny lines in the movie.Funny, witty and touching in places and generally enjoyable. It's not going to be the best comedy of the year by a long shot but great if you're in the mood for something light-hearted and cheesy.Worthy watching if not just for the scenes between Ricky and the dog."
Untraceable             ,Mike_L_Angelo,1,crime,2008,1,"This movie tries to hard to seem technically correct, and in doing that it kinda alienate a more technically oriented person. I see how the movie could be somehow entertaining to a person not very familiar with technology, but from a personal standpoint I found this movie to be extremely poor.There are a few things that are really obvious, and make the movie a really bad experience (warning - spoilers): 1. They could have stopped the website by contacting the major internet providers or ICANN and have the domain redirect to a black hole (similar to the Pakistani incident involving YouTube a few weeks ago). 2. The little girl has downloaded what seems to be a very obvious Playstation game onto a PC. You can see the fact it's a Playstation game from the control scheme on the screen (Circle, Square, X, Triangle). 3. Some of the computers used at work by the agents use trackballs instead of mice. I realize that trackballs look better and more techy, but no real ""hacker"" uses a trackball. 4. What kind of internet security expert gives full administrator privileges to their daughter, on the same computer they keep their work related files (Classified). 5. What kind of servers were exploited by this guy. I mean they had like 2-3 million hits a minute, with streaming video. I don't think that the dude infected a YouTube server farm. There is no way that a single server can handle all that traffic. And if there were multiple servers, there had to be a way to balance the traffic, which would be really tough. Exactly how many computers did he exploit, that blocking traffic from all those IPs was not an option. 6. There is no way to hack into somebody's car by remote. It has to be done from the car itself, and there is no way to program something like a power outage at a certain time. How did he power the satellite tracking if the entire car had no power ? If the car had no power, how was she able to stop and steer the car ? It should be extremely difficult to control a vehicle without power steering and power brakes.I am sure there are other tech glitches I do not remember at this time, but I am sure they were not as obvious.I did not enjoy this movie at all, because it tried to hard to be technologically correct. I am sure other people will enjoy the movie (I thought there was some hope for the movie in the less techy parts). If you're a geek I strongly don't recommend it, unless you want to see some tech comedy. Everyone else, give it a try. You might like it."
Slumdog Millionaire             ,RPaleja,0,drama,2008,9,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year. 5"
The House Bunny             ,georgia_cushion,1,comedy,2011,8,"I loved this. A very lighthearted film, with some very funny moments, It's got quite mature themes but I thought it was hilarious. Shelley dresses in quite a provocative way but I don't think that it is a bad. The story-line is clever and funny. My favourite part of the film is where Shelley gives all the girls in the house a make-over. I think that Anna Faris' delivered a superb performance but saying that I thought all the actors were good. This is a great film for a sleepover with girlie friends. If you want a girlie film to watch with friends at a sleepover or an easy-going film then this is the one for you! Overall I would give The House Bunny 8/1"
Lakeview Terrace             ,michael11391,0,crime,2008,8,"First of all, I want to say that Samuel L. Jackson's performance was absolutely ""creepy"" and he nailed perfectly!!! Back to the movie and it definitely surpassed my expectations (had high expectations for this movie). The movie had some twist & turns, some good laughs and was pretty intense. The movie starts off slow and then in the middle, it started to get interesting because Jackson's character starts to act like a lunatic and that's what so creepy about his character, he's very creepy and crazy. He wants the interracial couple movers play by (Wilson & Washington) to move out of his neighborhood and they don't want to because they want it to start a nice life and try to give it a few days so that they could work out their plans and have kids but Abel Turner (Jackson) had other ideas. He has two kids and want to raise them to be good kids and get respect the way he did in his childhood. Suddenly, they both were looking at the couple making out in the swimming pool and once Jackson's character sees that, he starts to get crazy and wild!! All hell breaks loose from there!! It was a pretty good movie, the performances were good, the plot was interesting and is very entertaining!! It's well worth your 2 hours, go and see it!!!"
The Incredible Hulk             ,YoSafBridge,0,action,2008,7,"Three cheers for Marvel for finally realizing that no one knows their material better then themselves. May they never sell another beloved superhero to a lesser being again.For the second time this summer Marvel has given us a superhero movie that just plain rocks. With the exact right amount of humour, character development and great action sequences, the Incredible Hulk is up there with Iron Man as one of my favourite films to be released so far in the summer movie season. While I didn't like it quite as much as Iron Man (Robert Downey WAS Tony Stark. Whereas something still doesn't sit right about Edward Norton as Bruce...) it was nevertheless a great, faithful adaptation of the comic books. Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! Possibly my favourite Stan Lee cameo yet.There isn't really much else to say besides, go see it for yourselves. If you're a fan of the comics, or just of fun popcorn films you'll definitely enjoy this one.8/10 "
Gomorrah             ,robertodonati-1,,crime,2009,1,"I read the book, I'm Italian, I'm a fan of mob movies but this movie was simply terrible. Out of the many stories the movie tries to tell only one (the tailor) is remotely interesting narratively. In fact that story should have been taken out of this pathetic dribble and made into its own movie. Honestly I think in this case the emperor has no clothes. This film, after about half an hour into it is borrrrring, completely uninteresting and incoherent. It has zero redeeming qualities. The director and writer needed to turn this over to someone who has an idea of what narrative storytelling is. Never have I seen so many people consistently leaving the movie theater. I felt like leaving, but hoping that it would somehow get better, I stayed. I wish I had left when I first suspected this film was going to suck (five minutes into it). Don't waste your money or your time."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,dromasca,0,misc,2013,8,"Biographical films tend to be respectful to the historical figures that they describe. Even when they describe complex and controversial characters they try to explain and to put in context the motivation of deeds which in the perspective of history seem evil. Paolo Sorrentino's 'Il Divo' is quite the contrary, it is a negative biography about a character who dominated the Italian politics for most of the second part of the 20th century, the leader of the Christian-Democratic Party and seven-times Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti. The film does not lack complexity - quite the contrary - and the historical context of the 80s and 90s is described in detail, but the effect is willingly opposite than in usual biographies. Even political actions which would have seen candid or neutral seem to catch a strong significance and are seen through the perspective of the corruption and Mafia-relations which seem to have dominated Italian political life of the period.My knowledge about the Italian politics is too superficial to make a definite judgment about the correctness of the facts presented on screen. What I can say after seeing the film is that it does not seem to pretend to be objective. Even if there is no explicit statement, there is neither any positive angle we brought into the film or positive dimension that is not questioned. Even the relationship with his wife ('I knew all these years what kind of man I married') or helping the poor (which looks more like a political exercise deprived of sincerity). There are however many other scenes (like the repeated walk on empty streets surrounded by cohorts of security people, the reception after his last nomination as Prime Minister) which describe not only the outer-worldness of the man, but also of the whole system.Even more amazing is the fact that Andreotti was alive when this film was made (he actually died about a month ago) and has seen at least part of the film, allegedly walking out after a while. So this is not only a biography, but a pamphlet directed against a living politician. Andreotti, by the way, was no stranger to the Italian cinema industry, he played an important role in establishing the rules that protected the local industry against foreign (especially Hollywood) imports in the 50s, but also the establishment of a de-facto censorship over the content of the productions which was in place for many decades. Is this film also kind of a revenge of the now free industry over this character? Maybe.To a very large extent 'Il DIvo' relies on the extraordinary acting performance of Toni Servillo. He makes one of these creations which in time tend to superpose and replace the visual representation we have about the real-life person. Great acting indeed, but do we end by understanding better Giulio Andreotti the man? I doubt it. Paolo Sorrentino certainly knows how to construct complex characters which do not show easily their intense internal beings. Looking now retrospectively he did the same thing in This Must Be the Place (which he made later, but I saw it before). He does not however serve the viewers with ready prepared answers about the motivation of his heroes. I knew very little about Andreotti before seeing this film, I know many more facts now, but the man remains a myster"
Kung Fu Panda             ,nikhil_2807,0,animation,2008,10,"My opinion:-- KungFuPanda is the best animated movie so far.

Very good comedy scenes, well crafted anime art, Good action sequences, good Chinese landscapes, and very well told story. The screenplay is great. Special mention to the voices. Jack Black Rocks !!

Space Chimps             ,ccthemovieman-1,,animation,2009,5,"Have you seen movies that almost wore you out after 45 minutes? Im talking about too much action, too much bickering and yelling between people, too much happening the screen, too loud.....just too much. You want to cry, ""enough, already....give us a few lulls!"" That's how found this cute-at-first animated film which starts off great but quickly spirals into the ""too much"" category and never lets go. Maybe I'm just too old for this sort of thing; maybe this is what five or ten-year-olds want....but I'm not surprised this animated film wasn't a hit - with adults or some kids.Don't get wrong: there are a number of funny lines in here, the animation is great in spots, and some of the characters (i.e. ""Kilowatt"") are very appealing. It's just that the film feels rushed, right from the start. One can never just settle down and enjoy the stories, character and artwork. This story needed more lulls.It also need less (""wink"" ""wink"") inside, pretentious remarks by the writers, who tried too hard to get their PC agendas in here throughout. The ""heroes,"" the space chimps, were always bickering among themselves. That led to some funny put-down lines but also got tiring, too, after almost an hour of it. The villain, ""Zartog,"" meanwhile, was just plain stupid. Nobody that silly/dumb, even in science fiction, could rule anyone.In all, it was just too disjointed and too frenetic - all the while being predictable - to enjoy. Although only 80 minutes in length, I found myself often checking how much time was left in the film"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,kiquescarlett,1,misc,2008,7,"I think that the main critics done to this film came from those who don't like Natalie or Scarlett. I hope it has nothing to do with the the fact that it is a costum movie - I personally found this film an excellent piece of drama, as well as the book was (I think it's an awesome reading, too!). A perfect cast, a good storyline and a strong screenplay are the main reasons that made ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" a wonderful screen adaptation - and both Portman and Johansson revealed themselves in one of their best performance ever! I also believe that the choice of casting two of the most brilliant and famous young actresses in Hollywood (perhaps the best ones, right now) was a smart move from the movie producers and - as well as the most fascinating thing about it is the rivalry between the two sisters - let it able to do captivate young people's attention.

Fireflies in the Garden             ,MacAindrais,0,drama,2008,NA,"Fireflies in the Garden (2008) **1/2The problem with movies about dysfunctional families is the same one that spy movies have: they're a dime a dozen, and rarely offer anything new. Wes Anderson has made dysfunction his specialty. Noah Baumbach's Squid and the Whale was also a very good film about dysfunctional families, as is Jonathan Demme's new film Rachael Getting Married. Dennis Lee's feature length debut, Fireflies in the Garden is a technically well made film. It looks good, it sounds good. Lee is a sound director. But good direction can't always save a flat script. That's the problem with the movie. It offers nothing new into an already crowded genre.I suspect that the film's script must have looked quite good. After all, it netted a slew of stars - Ryan Reynolds, Emily Watson, Willem Defoe, Hayden Panettiere, Iaon Gruffud, and Julia Roberts. Reynolds stars as as Michael Waechter, the son of a self absorbed intellectual jerk, Charles (Dafoe). His mother is Lisa (Roberts). The film goes back and forth in time, between Michael's childhood and present day. While on the way to Rhyne, the daughter's graduation party, Charles and Lisa get into a car accident while trying to avoid Christopher, Lisa's nephew. Lisa is killed.This sets up situations and complications to bring everyone together so they can argue and bicker, and of course, eventually reconcile. As the family gathers at the old family home, where Jane (Watson in the present, Panattiere in the past) now lives, old feelings are drudged over, and while going through their mother's things, Michael discovers a secret about his mother.Robert's and Watson play caring mothers. Lisa is passive, maybe too passive. Why she allows Charles to get away with some of the cruel things he does to the young Michael are confounding.Meanwhile, the film also glosses over the relationship between Jane and Michael, who are roughly the same age. That relationship is almost incestuous, although Lee never dares to fully delve into it. Everyone does solid work with their roles. Again a part of the technical solidity of the film. It's just that the story is too familiar, too flat. In the end, Dafoe has some moments of depth, and Reynolds gives a strong and layered performance. Otherwise, the script doesn't take enough time to flesh out its characters.Sure Michael has every reason to hate his father. He's a jerk, unabashedly so. The story needs to be maybe flushed out more, or maybe way less. There are stories enough for about three movies here. The plot line regarding young Christopher, who feels tremendous guilt over Lisa's death is enough for a film of this length. But there are so many other stories going on that it gets only limited time.There are some other small nitpicks that can be made. First, none of the kids look like their adult counterparts. That would be fine in a better movie, but here it's something you pick out. Second, although the film is set somewhere outside Chicago, it feels like somewhere in the south. Probably because it was shot in and around Texas.Based on a script that floated around Hollywood for sometime before getting financed, Fireflies in the Garden has floated around looking for a release since its debut back at the Berlin Film Festival. It's reported that the film will get a release come November. I suspect it will be limited, and suspect that it won't stick around theaters for long. Robert's might attract a few patrons to the multiplexes, but I wouldn't count on this one to make a big splash with anyone. I'm sure Lee has better in him."
Gomorrah             ,cribyn44,,crime,2008,1,"I have long come to the conclusion that many contributors of ""opinions"" about films that are posted on the IMDb web-site must belong to the human version of the lemmings who rush together to fall in company with each other over the edge of the cliff. So that, once you get one of these persons describing this farrago of a film as ""great"" or a ""masterpiece"", soon they are all at it! My wife and I managed to last just about an hour in the cinema last evening, before having had enough of this hopeless mess and mish mash and getting up and walking out, leaving the rest of the near empty cinema to it. Whilst the violence and repulsiveness of everything on screen was bad enough, although not surprising (and therefore not entirely ""unacceptable"" or surprising) in view of what one has seen in several recent films from Brazil and Colombia, it was the actual structure of the film that I found to be an insult to the intelligence of the intelligent film-goer.There was no attempt to create an intelligible structure to the whole, nothing the viewer could get a grip on in terms of latching on to any single character or thread to anything that resembled half a comprehensible story and script. It was just one chaotic charade after another - and for those who don't really understand, ""chaos"" does not produce intelligible literature or cinema.Next time I shall learn to pay more attention to some of the more perceptive film critics and not be persuaded by some who otherwise ought to join some of the lemming-like creatures on IMDb."
Good Dick             ,nkoliy,1,misc,2018,9,"This movie is strange. It starts slowly and one kind of thinks that it's gonna be a boring movie. But then one starts to watch it and actually live with the lives of the heroes. There's something about this movie. It reminds me of personal experiences of unrequited love or maybe unfullfilled love, when one cannot express all feelings but feels deeply. Sometimes I was wishing for the guy to leave the girl in teh movie, so much abuse was there. But then something opened up, and the girl did a great thing in the end. The guy did a great thing too by being humble and accepting for the most of it, which is a rare thing. Really strange movie, but kind of feels real like it could happen in lif"
The Reader             ,jaredmobarak,1,drama,2009,7,"What is guilt? I believe this is the central question behind Stephen Daldry's new film The Reader. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink, the story asks its audience what a true monster is. If you know a secret, one that could exonerate someone from being found guilty of murder, should you help her even though you know she's accepted her guilt despite being unable to stop it? What if that person was someone you loved? There is some heavy material thrown about in the second half of this film, emotions run high and people must make decisions concerning some very dire situations. One thing is for sure, though, once that decision is made, no matter which side of the fence you fall on, some shred of guilt, some feeling of remorse, is inevitably going to follow you around for the rest of your life. This is what we call being human, because as Bruno Ganz's Professor Rohl says, ""our justice is governed by laws, not morals."" It doesn't matter whether something was right or wrong, it's whether it was legal or illegal. Unfortunately our souls don't work that way.As said, these moral quandaries crop up in the brilliantly paced and constructed second half of the film. The power involved in the characters' actions all weigh heavy on those they touch. Perhaps the weight would not feel as palpable without the events of the first act, but either way, that portion of the film is too light and innocuous. We learn about young Michael Berg's, (a wonderful turn by David Kross, who is the true star of the film), affair with an older woman named Hanna Schmitz. This woman is very troubled and in a state of constant flux where her emotions are concerned. She loves Berg, but can never quite allow herself to fully commit to that feeling, her past continuously nagging at the back of her head, remembering what it was she used to do with those who read to her. Kate Winslet's performance as Hanna is quite good, but like the film itself, doesn't come into its own until the second act, when all the secrets finally become uncovered.It is a good beginning, the unabashed love of a young 15 year old and his first sexual partner. He becomes her orator of stories and partner in romance, but they both know it could never last. School would be commencing and Berg would see the young girls his age, ever comparing them to Hanna, and her manifesting his feelings with her own jealousy, knowing that she must let him go <U+0085> this time sending herself away rather than those she ""befriended"" of her past, those she sent off to whatever fate awaited them. Whether this violation became so deeply rooted in the boy, I'm not sure, but when he goes off to law school and crosses paths with his first love again, this time as she awaits charges of Nazi war crimes, he is torn on what is morally correct. It becomes his obligation to let the truth come out, despite the activities she partook in during the Holocaust. According to the law, he must divulge the information for justice, but his moral compass may not be able to do so.The story truly is wonderfully acted and directed, pulling at the audience's emotions and engaging them throughout. However, while the second half is the most intriguing and resonant, it also contains the one activity that I found abhorrent. Now older, Michael Berg is played by Ralph Fiennes, a lawyer, recently divorced and with a daughter. His journey back home, to his mother that has all but given up on him as a distant figure unable to open up to those that love him, becomes one of returning memories. Discovering the books he once read to Hanna almost two decades earlier, the guilt of what he didn't do makes him set upon a mission to right that wrong. But the way in which he does so is really quite wrong to me. He seems to condemn her for what she did still and only creates cassettes of stories to send her to assuage his own selfish need for forgiveness. He never appears to care about her, because if he did, he would have made different choices in that courtroom years before. Berg shows the selfishness that followed him the entire story and really got me thinking that maybe he was a worse human being than Hanna. It's an interesting dynamic to be sure, one that subverts the somewhat ""touching"" conclusion the filmmakers seem to want to attempt.The Reader is an interesting look at German guilt and the people's need to place blame on others for the Holocaust in order to somehow absolve their own indifference of doing nothing when they themselves knew what was going on. One of Berg's classmates gets the whole issue correct in a little tirade about the absurdity of the trial. Here they all were, guilty themselves of knowing what went on in the thousands of camps, yet putting on trial only six women because a survivor, (interesting to see Lena Olin play a mother and daughter<U+0097>the beauty of a film spanning decades), wrote a book fingering them. Just as Germany needed to place blame, so did Michael Berg. Rather than put it on his own shoulders though, like Hanna eventually selflessly does, he decides to side with the masses, sitting back silently and then trying in earnest to deal with his eventual guilt, not to apologize to the person he let down, but to somehow forgive himself. It is quite the despicable act and I'm not sure if that was the filmmakers' intent, however, that is the lasting impression it left on me."
Gomorrah             ,nicolechan916,,crime,2015,7,"The actors did a great job with their characters, and rightly so as most are locals of the area. The usage of non-professional actors/ local talent really helped in capturing the authenticity of the story. Also, the location-shooting did a great job in capturing the core of the Mafia, while also establishing its widespread influences. The spaces we see are limited, but many. What I mean by this is that because of the different story-lines, we see many different spaces, but what we see of these spaces is limited. They do not travel much in their own settings (except for Franco and Roberto who travel across the country).The first scene of the film establishes the violence of the subject and the aggressiveness of the Mafia. The film does show quite a bit of explicit content. This helps to deny the glorification that being part of the Mafia is usually depicted as bringing. Unlike how conspicuous consumption and success is shown in Scarface (which is also referenced in this movie), Matteo Garrone makes an effort not to show that side of glorification. The Mafia members here are ruthless, violent and seemingly do not have morals. It takes little to agitate them and loyalty plays a big part in maintaining one's safety. This again shows the reality of the film and the lives of the people in Naples.The endings of the different story-lines complement each other in sending the message that you are either with or against the Camorra. Although in the case of Roberto, his future is left ambiguous which is a little confusing.Overall a great portrayal of the Camorra system in Naples, with well established story-lines and great acting. What makes this film terrifying is the fact that this is based from reality and that the people living there have no choice but to go along or face the consequences (usually death).Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.c"

One Missed Call             ,residentofarea51,0,horror,2008,1,"Yes I know it's supposed to be a horror but it isn't. There are some parts that had me rolling around on the floor. Seriously, there are so many clichés and parts that make absolutely no sense. There's also parts where you think ""why are they doing that?"" or ""why don't they just do this?"" Then there's the ending which seems to think that it makes the rest of the film make perfect sense when it's just stupid. Nothing in the film adds up at all and it's just generally very inconsistent. I haven't seen the Japanese version but I heard that it's a lot better if you actually want a horror film. Otherwise, be on the look out for a guy with an umbrella at the end - priceless!"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,ldarroch,0,animation,2009,8,"I'd be hard pressed to name a kid's flick I've seen in the last four years that can't be summed up by ""a quest to find his true self."" For once, the hero knows who he is, and lives by this truth rather than learning to define himself along the journey. It was refreshing to see a slightly less-linear film aimed at the under-10 crowd. There were at least 3-4 narratives to follow (mouse, rat, servant girl, and to a lesser extent, the royal family). The notion that one's actions and attitude can greatly affect those around you, in unexpected ways with surprising consequences, was a lovely lesson to learn, rather than the rote ""value of friendship"" moral. I don't quite get the Ratatouille comparisons, frankly. OK, the heroes are both rodents. And there is a chef. This film reminded me more of Big Fish, The Princess Bride, and Pushing Daisies with its small themes and seemingly meandering narrative, that all comes nicely at the end. And yes, the film was utterly beautiful."
Flash of Genius             ,neacorp,0,misc,2009,5,"I'm an inventor and an engineer at hart and wanted to see this movie as addition to my experience.Did you know Robert Kearns died in 2005 before seeing this movie? If you did some background search about him, the movie will be different. Yes, it will be the same ""David vs. Goliath"" but you will see a different David. So you might want to see this movie twice and stop reading revues NOW.Yes, he wins in the end. Hollywood won't make a movie where David looses in the end. The story of inventing the intermittent wiper in 1953 was great, but a tad long. In my opinion there were too many scenes to make Robert more compassionate before we get the actual trial. His family life is shown mostly from Roberts perspective alone. At some brief points I did believe the entire world was against him. But the lawsuit itself is short for an ""epic"" fight. And the ending wasn't really an ending - he got a lot more cash after that.Everyone's acting is good for a history reenactment. Tim Kelleher looks like dramatic Jim Carrey at some angle in this movie. Nicely edited to see on TV if it ever comes out.OK, now about the story that follows and THIS is the part where you STOP reading if you haven't seen the movie yet.SPOILER.Robert Kearns is listed as #3 in ""7 People Who Never Gave Up (But Absolutely Should Have)"". See the phrase for more info on that, but I'll tell it short. He was crazy, probably partly because of the propaganda lifestyle at the times. He set his primary goal to get justice, like some superhero, that he was THE inventor. Though he won, he lost his family in the process. And after that he set ALL his cash into (are you ready?) more lawsuits. Yep, he didn't invest the money, nor did he retire. He went for the name of THE inventor of intermittent wiper. It wasn't ever about the money. He became his own lawyer AFTER the Ford trial. In 1991, a federal judge dismissed all his outstanding lawsuits because Kearns' patents had expired. Kearns retired to a big house in the country to devote himself to a new hobby: trying to reclaim his patents.His craziness wasn't a mental breakdown <U+0096> it was his way of life. Knowing this you will not see a man with some problems, you will see some crazy guy going for god knows what and slowly loosing his family in the process. Good thing he died in 2005 or he would have used this film for his crusade. A crazy David vs. Goliath? Now that's an interesting movi"
Righteous Kill             ,Panterken,0,crime,2008,4,"'Righteous Kill' not only disappoints, it's an epic failure. And I mean wanna-punch-everyone-involved failure. Re-watching that one petite coffee-house scene with De Niro and Pacino in 'Heat' will jolt more electricity into you than this whole waste of celluloid. 'Righteous Kill' is a movie that actually accomplishes to have both De Niro and Pacino hand in a performance so far under their usual level, I'm still in disbelief over it. A healthy suggestion: avoid all films by this untalented hack not worthy of the title 'director'. For example, he also made Pacino look bad in the stinker '88 minutes', a straight-to-cable thriller meets 'Phone Booth'.Shouldn't these two legends make use of their golden years to partake in interesting movies, why doesn't Pacino make another Lumet (see: Dog Day Afternoon) or why not team up again with Mann again (Heat). Surely they have the power to pull the tablecloth toward them when it comes to getting roles in prestigious projects? Why they rather star in a movie that kids 'you can lick my balls any time' is beyond me. If you think I'm being too dramatic, go see for yourself but don't come crying to me when you get your heart ripped out and served on a platter as well... "
The Square             ,Quantum99,0,crime,2010,9,"I saw this film at CineVegas in June of 2009. Some other film students I was with expected this film to be boring but I was intrigued by the plot of the film. And when we came out of the theater, I was speechless. This film was all I talked about for the rest of that summer.There was so much greatness in this film, especially the story. I dig these kinds of stories so I was very pleased. There was even a few twists in there that really got me. The other thing that stood out was the cinematography. Now it might not be the best but it was very realistic (alot of scenes are hand-held but not a bad thing). Another was the actors/actresses. David Roberts did a fantastic job. I've never seen him in another film except the last 2 Matrix films but in The Square he was great. Claire van der Boom was great as well. She's a beautiful actress and again I've never seen her in another film but would love to see more. I think her performance is almost academy award worthy IMO. These 2 worked well together creating the perfect mood for the film. The music was nice. It fit very well with the film especially the ending scene, it almost had me in tears. And lastly, the director Nash Edgerton. I've seen his short films and the are pretty good but for his debut full length film, this was a huge success. I admire his style and hope to see more great films by him in the near future.I wont spoil anything from the film but if you like thrillers then this is one you have to watch. I was hooked from the opening scene and by the end of the film I was jaw dropped and speechless. Great Australian fil"
Kung Fu Panda             ,Pelrad,0,animation,2008,10,"There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,DaMarco-2,,adventure,2010,NA,"Michael Chabon is one of our generation's greatest writers, having earned the acclaim of awards and prizes that he deserves. ""Wonder Boys"" was made into a very good if uneventful film, and one has high hopes for ""Kavalier & Klay."" ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" is about Art Bechstein, the young son of a gangster who does not want him to follow in his footsteps. Art has majored in business but has no taste for it. It is the summer after his graduation and he is supposedly studying for a test that will license him to work in high finance, though he spends his time enjoying the summer as the last of his youth.Art works at a bookstore and meets Phlox, an attractive young woman. He also makes friends with a gay man named Arthur Lecomte, who introduces him to Cleveland Arning. Art meets Cleveland's girlfriend Jane who is striking and mysterious to him. Art spends his summer in relationships with these people and learning more about himself.The tone of the book is one of the great accomplishments of Chabon's writing. It is wry and witty, and ever so slightly tongue in cheek. My favorite line in the book is the last, in which Art tells us this summer was a turning point for him, or maybe he just made it all up. Art is a cousin to Holden Caufield, with his attitudes, but he takes himself far less seriously.This film is not the trainwreck that many would have you to believe, including devotees of the novel. While some criticize the glossy cinematography, I would argue that it is one of the few things that work in this film. Pittsburgh has a fascinating aesthetic that deserves to be filmed well, and the cinematographer accomplished that.The overall problem with the film is that it never comes even remotely close to capturing the tone of the novel. The wit and humor are gone completely. The tone of this movie is so deathly serious that none of the events that were shocking in the novel are the least bit surprising in the film. It is the equivalent of sitting in the parlor of a funeral home.Jon Foster is an exercise in bad casting. He looks like what one imagines Art to look like--mildly handsome, lanky, a non-showy intelligence--but never once plays the character properly. There is no slyness, no humor, no wit or warmth in this performance, and that is about 60% of what's wrong with the whole film. Foster does not even come remotely close to the character we followed in the novel. A toned down Topher Grace is what the part called for, but all we get is an actor who is so bland and dull that we couldn't care less about the character he is playing.Peter Sarsgaard was perfect casting as Cleveland, and has a resume of similar successful roles in his past. However, Sarsgaard plays Cleveland with all the seriousness of a war veteran who's lost his legs. The unpredictability and wildness that makes up the book's character is not in the film.Sienna Miller's Jane is an overinflated part, about a character who was only meant to be an enigma in passing, sort of like Suzanne Somer's ""Girl in the White T-Bird"" in ""American Graffiti."" Her mere beauty is supposed to mean more to us than it ever does.Only Mena Survari as Phlox and Nick Nolte as Art's gangster father manage to properly convey what we knew about the characters. Unfortunately the likable Phlox is reduced to being a clingy nymphomaniac, as opposed to the sweet, likable free spirit in the novel. Still Survari made the part work despite limited screen time.Art's sexual awakening is glossed over and Cleveland's bisexuality is treated more as pansexuality. The film has the nerve to show the men in embrace, but cuts to the morning after in chaste fade away.Even the Cloud Factory is given a short shrift. A prominent fixture in the book, it is also a big player in the movie, but as with the characters, it is also played as a serious location rather than a humorous one. The actual plant in the novel is a working facility at Carnegie Mellon University. In the film, it is an abandoned facility outside of town about which Cleveland says no one knows why smoke still comes out of the stack. Well, actually, smoke can only come from a stack if it is fed coal or some other energy source, which someone must purchase. So if no one is buying coal for it then such a thing is not even possible. Smoke doesn't just appear! And that sums up the problem with this film. Smoke appears out of nowhere and for no reason, as do the human emotions. We don't see any motivation or reasoning, and we never understand why any of these boring people want anything to do with each other.Pittsburgh is a fascinating city with a rich history, Chabon's novel is a great book with rich characters. Both got the short shrift in this plodding and pointless film. The only way to enjoy it is to put it on TV at a party and turn down the sound while playing a music CD. The visuals make for great music video and replace the characters who never muster any personality in the atmosphere of the film. Like most films about ennui, we become bored with watching boredo"
Street Kings             ,jillisvm,,misc,2008,1,"Apart from an American Pie 1, 2 and 3 marathon I couldn't think of a bigger waste of my time than watching this movie. I like action movies, even the cop ones, I like Sin City-like body counts, loved Keanu Reeves in movies like the Matrix and The watcher, but this one really, and I mean REALLY, disappointed me. I mean, a cast with names like Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie does raise a certain expectancy. The storyline itself already promised little good. An alcoholic cop who lost his wife, his partner and doesn't have much regard for the law now has to save city and pride, accompanied by some rookie. Did any one else wonder why Bruce Willis wasn't asked for the part of Tom Ludlow? The scenes of Tom going around town with his guns, vodka and unchangeable expression is not only accompanied by cliché, standard-action-movie music (the type you start to notice after a few minutes and bugs you for the rest of the time), but also by some of the worst dialogues I've seen moviecharacters have. Rivaled maybe by King Arthur's horrible attempts to sound historical and philosophical at the same time- but at least that movie had proper actors and good, exciting action in it. It also didn't have the uselessness of the plot that 'Street Kings' does possess. At the end of the movie, nothing is solved for good, Tom Ludlow'll still be depressed and the viewer is left with that same emotion and a sort of 'Ok, sooo....?'-unsatisfied feeling. And after a last look at Tom Ludlow, staring at the setting sun, exactly like Reeves (honestly man, even Neo managed a subtle change every now and then!) stared at everything else in the movie, the credits start to roll. Thank you, David Ayer, for making cops look corrupt and Reeves look untalented, for a movie with exactly one line I managed to laugh at, and please, Hugh Laurie, focus yourself on making more House-episodes for us to enjoy...!"
What Happens in Vegas             ,Chris Knipp,1,comedy,2008,7,"A lazy young man who's just been fired by his own father and an uptight financial sector striver just dumped by her boyfriend go to Las Vegas with pals to forget and, meeting, get married in a night of drunken carousing and diminished rationality. Then he wins $3 million on a slot machine with her quarter and they wind up in court fighting over an annulment and the right to the three million. The judge dislikes them both equally and sentences them to remain married and cohabit for six months and prove they're working to get along. A series of domestic plots and battles follows as each tries to outsmart the other to win in court and get all the money. They end up liking each other. I know the reviewers are right to trash this movie, but they're missing something essential that would raise the audience rating a good many points above the critics' if they fail to note one thing that is the main reason why most of us go to see it. 'What Happens in Vegas' has not only the trappings of a big, expensive Hollywood comedy, the bright colors and nice sets, but two big glamorous stars, and they are not humiliated by being here, because they do look very good, and mismatch or not, look good together too. Yes, the script is lousy. The setups and jokes are lame and clichéd and sometimes crass, tasteless, and adolescent. The arc is predictable. The progression isn't particularly interesting or even logical. The individual scenes consequently aren't ever pitched to be very funny and the dialog never surprises you either. But that very lack of high pitched comedy can be a plus if you find Cameron amazing and cool and Ashton gorgeous and appealing. The absence of a high laugh level such as the Apatow comedies occasionally achieve means they get to act more like people; they can register ordinary expressions instead of mere comic mugging and you get to look at them, which is one good and durable reason for watching this movie. And both are aging well. Ashton is big and handsome. The pretty-boy quality is fading into something more like an old time Hollywood leading man look. Cameron is sexy and elegant and looks great in a tight gown. Ashton has learned something since the staccato limitations of ""That Seventies Show."" He actually registers six or seven different, and recognizably human, expressions now. He's added sarcasm and meanness. He may be a people-pleaser forever, but he doesn't try as hard as he used to, nor does the good old boy personality hide a certain level of intelligence, just as the ""Punk'd"" bad-ass persona has never hidden an essential kindness. The one plot element that works is that he's the one of the pair who's got the emotional smarts; it is harder to believe Cameron's character is as cut off from feeling as she's supposed to be. But not too hard, because there's a hardness about her.Yes, it is disappointing that most of the Vegas night is done in a rapid-fire montage that's more like an acid trip than an evening of heavy drinking; that nothing sexier happens; that the wedding is reduced to a final (not very successful) outtake sequence. The ending is slushy sentimental; but it is sweet. The critics' revulsion remains incomprehensible to me because 'What Happens in Vegas' leaves a good taste, if not a very strong one. I was a little bothered by the young Asian woman (a misused Michelle Krusiec) being made so stereotypically the unappealing suffering striver: that's more mean than funny. Queen Latifah is mellow as always but wasted as the marriage counselor. Director Tom Vaughan deserves little credit, but it is writer Dana Fox who is most to blame for the mediocrity of the result. Kutcher and Diaz and the others do a very good job. When you think about it, how much is the ""originality"" of other recent Hollywood comedies really worth? Where's the trail-blazing in '40 Year Old Virgin,' 'Super Bad,' or even the wishful-thinking 'Juno'? But no mistake about it, this movie is for fans of good-looking people in glossy movies, not smart comedy or edge. Compare this to Ashton in 'Just Married' and you'll see this role is better. For sheer mindless fun he peaked in 'Dude, Where's My Car?' Of course Cameron has a far stronger comedy--and general movie--résumé, so again Ashton's playing opposite her is not a step back but a step forward. But an attempt to analyze the plot seems futile. Its failings are too obvious to bother listing."
Changeling             ,sclapham,1,misc,2008,10,"Summary says it all, this is the most challenging film so far of 2008. Deep and daring, Clint exposes corruption within LAPD in this period piece. Brilliantly executed and finally a performance I appreciate from Angelina. Also stellar performances by John Malkovich, as well as Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly, and others. This film drives it home which any parent can appreciate and will remember for some time.This is not your typical drama, but also a suspense filled thriller that had people in the theater crying, clapping, and closing their eyes.Still need to see The Wrestler, and The road, but as of October 2008, CHANGELING best picture, and very possible, Best Actress Angelina Jolie. 2"
Igor             ,Simon_Says_Movies,0,animation,2008,3,"A staple of any family oriented animated film, past, present and I'm certain continuing into the future, is that it must appeal to both old and young alike. This can represent any sort of balance of splendid animation that stimulate the senses, pop culture references that give the adults a guffaw and of course generally competent film-making. Not only does Igor fail spectacularly at reaching a broad audience spectrum but fails at almost every other tier of film-making at the same time. To be blunt, I am a sucker for animated films. Looking over my archive of films viewed in the past, animated features are the one genre of movie that continues to be of a solid calibre. There are obvious missteps, such as with films like as Madagascar, but with the creative minds associated with studios like Pixar, Disney and the finally blossoming Dreamworks, who pump out a few flicks each a year, achieving widespread failure is difficult. Not only did I essentially hate Igor, but it is one of, if not the worst animated film I have witnessed. In its attempt to appeal to the masses, Igor plays it dark and sinister and boasts a similar vibe to the Gil Kenan faux pas Monster House and as such will not find an audience with children. At the other end of the table, director Anthony Leondis effort to insert inside jokes and mature humour falters complimentary to the former, as none of these jests are particularly insightful nor funny and results in a mediocre experience all round. In summation, we have a film that kids will not understand, and that adults will simply find to be a poor movie. I was continually surprised by the macabre and depressing components of Igor, and would most likely make even Tim Burton squirm. Even a simple plot summary reveals the bleakness and sometimes unnerving subject matter that it evident here. In the cloud consumed land of Malaria, evil reigns. The black-hearted King Malbert (Jay Leno) encourages widespread acts of evil and malice over the entire kingdom. In this dark place, the scientific community are represented by half-dozen or so prestigious, but mad scientists. Looming on the horizon however, is the yearly evil science fair in which the most brilliant minds compete to create the most evil invention imaginable. Malaria is land of quirky and eccentric creatures, bizarre architecture, as well as being a place where ""Igor"" is no longer a name, but a verb. Every mad scientist has their own ""Igor"", which essentially pertains to their hideous appearance and servant-like place in society who exist solely to ""pull the switch"". In this specific Igor's (John Cusack) castle, it is the hunchbacked sidekick that is the true brains behind the operation, so to speak. His master Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese) continues to falter and does not heed the advice of his subordinate or that of Igor's creations including a robot named Brain (Sean Hayes) although labelled with permanent marker incorrectly, much to his chagrin, as ""Brian"" and Scamper (Steve Buscemi) a suicidal reanimated rabbit. (Yes, you heard me; he continually and morbidly commits suicide throughout the film. Oh, and did I mention his is immortal?) After a disastrous failed experiment Glickenstein is killed, and Igor excitedly takes the reigns to ensure victory over his invention stealing nemesis Dr. Schadenfreude (Eddie Izzard) and floozy sidekick Jaclyn (Jennifer Coolidge). His dream is to create a life of pure evil, and in true Frankenstein fashion, he constructs a large and hideous monster named Eva. (Derived from a mispronounced ""evil"", but also eerily similar to the name of WALL·E's love interest, Eve in summers vastly superior film) The one small problem<U+0085>Eva is not eva enough, and thus is useless for his competition. Yet after befriending the creature, he is torn between achieving the respect of colleges, and finding what may be love. With elements of violent death, suicidal rabbits, betrayal and general emphasis on evil, such a macabre take on the popular ""Hang in there"" poster, featuring the cat clinging to a clothes line, which this time round features a dead cat dangling from a noose. At the conclusion there is the essential moral teaching about being who you want to be and thus forth, but the ride is not a fun one to be on. Despite the lean running time the storyline seems fragmented and meanders wildly at times. Scene stealing moments by Buscemi can't save the failed multi-generational gimmick and mediocre voice work from the remaining cast; this is not prime family entertainment and like its protagonist, will end up being an outcast itself."
The Express             ,thinker1691,,misc,2009,8,"When studios turn back the clock in movies, they expose the excessive baggage which accompanied our bigoted and ignorant past. Audiences living in the present decade can observe all of the social ills of those bygone eras. Social problems in America have all but been buried, yet irritatingly they surface when our society is reminded not every American has learned the lessons of the past. Thus it is with this superior movie called "" The Express."" The great Ernie Davis is played by Rob Brown as an adult and Justin Martin in his youth. Both actors do a incredible job. Dennis Quaid plays Ben Schwartzwalder, the inspirational coach who does an exceptional job. The icon Jim Brown is played by Darren Henson and Charles Dutton is William Davis Sr. Although the film traces the life of Ernie Davis, it only highlights the major events, tragedies and triumphs of the all star player at Saracues University. The movie is inspirational on many levels and touches the viewer with the most dramatic obstacles such as racism and segregation. Indeed a personal meeting with the late great John F. Kennedy is sure to evoke positive memories. Throughout the entire movie one is offered a blunt eye-view of our most brutal social affliction and one can only hope our great nation will one day make it obsolete. Easilly recommended to all audiences. ****"
Stop-Loss             ,the_Poppuns,0,drama,2008,8,"It's horrible that we need a new one, you'd think people would learn their lesson the first, or hundredth, time they were taught it. But anyway, the movie is pretty good. At the very beginning it reminded me of 'Redacted' and then later 'In the Valley of Elah' and you could say with most movies that that would be a detriment but they're all telling stories about the same subject. So it's not like anyone is copying anyone else.This movie is more movie-ish than those I mentioned. It works as entertainment(that sounds wrong) as well as being informative. It's showing you a certain situation people are going through but it's also a ""movie"", with action scenes, good acting, relationship issues, etc. As I said the acting is good. Ryan Phillipe is I want to say underrated, but maybe he's not rated at all. He's an extremely good looking person who could have just been in romantic comedies and made some nice money that way, but instead he's carved out an interesting resume for himself. He does some of his best work here. Joseph Gordon Levitt, everyone's favorite young indie actor, shows up here as well, although he has a smaller role than he normally does. He and the rest of the cast were also really good. Ciaran Hinds makes an interesting cowboy, btw. I wouldn't have guessed that. The only problem I may have had with the film is that I didn't like the ending. But that doesn't take away from the fact that I think this is a well-made movie.The film is serious. It'll probably be depressing for most people. But hey life is depressing right now. Especially for people involved in this situation and maybe those folks should consider whether they should really watch it or not. Because I would think they'd want to escape that reality. The people who aren't paying attention to what's going on should see it. I'd have less problem recommending this to them. I think it's the least likely of the Iraq based movies to offend anyone. It's got a few violent war scenes but nothing over-the-top or terribly graphic. It's just basically wave at you saying ""hel-lo, this is the stuff you're trying to ignore but should really be paying attention to.' There is a normal amount of cursing and no naked people that I can remember.If you haven't been watching the Iraq war centered movies, it's time you saw one and this would probably be the easiest to take."
Slumdog Millionaire             ,jackhajduk,0,drama,2008,10,"I also saw this film at to Toronto Film Festival. The audience gave it a well deserved standing ovation. This story is told seamlessly. The revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and terrifying story lines. The use of flashbacks to tell the story took you on a journey in time and culture. They used three sets of actors of three different ages to move the story. The use of the youngest actors (actually slum kids from Mumbai) stole the show. These kids were incredible showing both the beauty and the horrors of growing up in Bombay. And that's not to take away from the amazing performances of Freida, Dev, and the actor playing the older Saleem. There performances moved many to tears. See this movie it won't disappoint! 3"

Untraceable             ,Chrysanthepop,1,crime,2008,NA,"While it has some effective cinematography and nice-to-look-at high-tech, 'Untraceable' is nothing but a typical snuff thriller. The characters are all clichéd, unintelligent and, with the exception of Hanks's Griffin and Diane's Jennifer they lack dimension. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. The story suffers from too many plot holes. The ending is funny (though the director's intention was clearly something other than drawing laughter from the viewer). It's very funny how the director portrays all American internet surfers to be thirsty for a glimpse of torturous death. Among the plus points, Diane Lane performs well (but her character is the typical crime-fighting single mom/widow which one has seen in n number of movies. Colin Hanks gives a natural performance but one wonders why an actor of his calibre chose to play a less significant role in a below-average thriller. The same question applies to Ms. Lane. Billy Burke is abysmally wooden and his dialogue delivery is laughable especially when he swears. The swearing, while adding to another movie stereotype where the coppers swear a lot, feels too forced. Joseph Cross horribly plays the typical teen psycho. There's really nothing else to say. 'Untraceable' has nothing to offer. The only thriller concerning snuff movies that is of high quality is Amenabar's 'Tesis' and 'Untraceable' is nowhere near that."
Trucker             ,kuchynata,1,drama,2008,NA,"I was able to see this film at the Austin Film Festival 2008. Saw it twice actually, since Natnan Fillion's number one fan wasn't able to go the night I had it on my calendar. Despite problems with the script (didn't always ring true) and definitely with the dialogue (again, problems with truth, and reality), Nathan, Michelle, and Jimmy give fine performances. Dialogue weakness, I would guess, would be a tough thing for an actor to overcome, but Nathan sails through it with flying colors. I would have liked to have asked the director why he chose sepia tones for some of the scenes - they simply didn't fit with the message/action on screen. I'd ask, but he'd probably not answer, like in the Q&A at the Sunday evening screening. (What, me bitter? No.) If I had to guess, I'd say that the director makes some rookie errors since this was his first narrative; and, it appears he was more interested in being an ""artiste"" rather than telling the audience a story. Overall though, I enjoyed the picture, particularly Nathan Fillion, Michelle Monaghan and Jimmy Bennett."

The Merry Gentleman             ,Movies505,,crime,2010,NA,"Here are the good things about this movie: Dialogue. The dialogue is very realistic. I was shouting the same exact responses the characters did BEFORE they spoke them.Continuity/editing: Someone was paying real close attention. I can't remember seeing such perfect continuity. The two cops confabbing in the car is a perfect example.Camera work: Ex: the church scene is nice and wide which equals powerful.Pace: the pace was spot-on for this story. The pace matched the characters, their actions, and motives.The story: the story was a nice little slice of life. The Merry Gentleman almost reminded me of a foreign flick. Michael Keaton: His body language, his walk, and his facial expressions were an asset to his character. One exception: that wasn't you Michael walking away on the grass. I could tell. I needed to know that was you walking away. Clearly, it was not. You used a body double and that was a big let down.The other actors: Nice ensemble who all worked well and off one another.Okay, a woman sees a man on the top of a building after he's just made a hit. Who cares if you can figure out what's going to happen next, or to whom? Is that why we watch movies? To be brilliant? Look, it's not the story that drives The Merry Gentleman. It's the characters. And those who said they don't care about the characters - perhaps you don't care in the way you care whether Chief Brody makes it out of the ocean alive - but you care. Or at least, you're curious.The two things I don't like: 1. The title. 2. The DVD cover photo.Watch this movie because Michael Keaton did many satisfying things creating and telling the story. Hopefully, we'll see more of him as a director and an actor. Hey, Michael, do you read any unsolicited scripts"
Australia             ,tastyworm,1,adventure,2008,8,"Baz Luhrmann has done a great job with 'Australia'. While cliché's and political agenda runs rife, this is set nicely into an historic, epic story in three distinct acts.Great casting - Hugh Jackman was what the role needed, and he played the role very well. Nicole Kidman, while being rubbished by several critics, appeared somewhat typecast in her role, but that style was exactly what the role needed, and I think she did a great job at pulling it off. However, I think that the standout performances actually came from Brandon Walters (in his first film), Jack Thompson (in a minor role) and David Wenham who brought 'aussie sleaze' to a new level. Unfortunately, I had trouble believing in Ben Mendelsohn's character of Captain Dutton, but seemed to finish on a high, pulling the 'British stiff upper lip' thing fairly well.Luhrman's epic was long, and had the full gamut of Luhrmanesque style, which we've come to love through his films. Stylised backgrounds, unique, visual approaches, and a sense of humour that is truly Luhrman, flood the film bringing a rich Australian environment.'Australia' presents to the world, perhaps a very different Australia to what a lot of people think. While the fictional characters and some of the style is very reminiscent of ""Gone with the Wind"", the historical Darwin during the 'Stolen Generation' era and the impact of World War Two on Australia's doorstep may be a new insite to many.I enjoyed 'Australia' a lot. While it wasn't the best film I've ever seen, I definitely think it's worth looking at - even if it's just to see what Baz Luhrman has done. 2"
The Duchess             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,misc,2008,8,"I couldn't wait for The Duchess, I am just a huge fan of period pieces and Kiera Knightly is becoming a fantastic actress in this genre. I was looking forward to this film mainly because I studied Georgina a little bit in college for my history class and I always thought she was such an elegant and strong woman that stood out from the others. She was like the Madonna of her day, she had a great sense of style, self, and strength. While the movie is not completely accurate, it still was a fine movie to watch. Kiera truly held her own as Georgina and was absolutely stunning. One of the underlining stories that I appreciate in this film is the battle of the sexes. Ralph Fiennes who plays the Duke of Devonshire does a fantastic job as well and he plays this anti-villain, shows the true side of the pain and pressure men felt but how they looked at women as nothing but property. This story truly touches you and makes you grateful for our present day.Georgina is born into a high class family of royalty who is about to be married off to the Duke of Devonshire and everything seems great, G is going to live the high life of class, culture, and being a lady of the people. She comes across the price though: her husband's affairs that are practically rubbed in her face, her life is constantly watched and judged by people, she must be perfect at all times to keep up her reputation as a joyful lady, she is forced to be the mother of the duke's child from an affair he had, as well as she cannot birth a son for the Duke and he will find every opportunity to rub it in her face. All this and Georgina has found another love who she cannot give her heart to fully for the love of her children and people.The Duchess is a fine film that I truly enjoyed. I wouldn't be surprised if Kiera was nominated for best actress during the academy season. I would highly recommend this movie, especially for the period piece lovers. Like I said, this film makes you appreciate what we have today in our modern society and truly makes you feel for the pressures both men and women had to face in that day. Georgina is a figure that I think is very looked over in history when she is one of the strongest presences in England's history. The Duchess, even though not entirely accurate, does a very good job of telling her story and was a pleasure to watch.8/10"
The Duchess             ,MaxBorg89,1,misc,2008,6,"When Quentin Tarantino presented Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, he famously stated that Merchant-Ivory productions were a major turn-off for him, much like on-screen violence could be for someone else. No one else seems to agree with him, though, or at least not openly, since lots of British directors are trying to become the next James Ivory (the real one lost his mojo with The White Countess, which also marked his last collaboration with the late producer Ismail Merchant). And while Joe Wright hit the jackpot with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, his colleague Saul Dibb doesn't fare as well with The Duchess, an elegant but frigid costume drama which fails to be particularly dramatic.To secure some kudos, Dibb cast Wright's go-to leading lady Keira Knightley as the film's heroine, Georgiana Spencer, whose life changes radically when the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) asks for her hand in marriage. The quality of her lifestyle improves significantly, and all she has to do, as she's frequently reminded by her mother (Charlotte Rampling), is to be a good wife. Unfortunately, that task proves more difficult than expected, since the Duke insists on having a male heir and Georgiana keeps giving birth to boys. All that's left for the poor man is to find a mistress, who happens to be the Duchess's best (in fact, only) friend (Hayley Atwell). Georgiana would like to retaliate by having an affair with her former suitor Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), but common decency suggests she shouldn't. Why? Because she's just a woman.Unhappy marriage, sex seen as a mere reproductive device, lust for freedom, society of the past seen as a mirror of contemporary events. Sound familiar? yes, the blueprint is obviously Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, a far superior period piece that manages to speak to the audiences of today. Coppola did that thanks to the soundtrack, which emphasized the idea of the Queen of France being a rebellious teenager; Dibb's approach involves parallels with Georgiana's famous descendant, Princess Diana, as well as a political subtext suggesting the Duchess was one of the world's first feminists. Fair enough, as long as he has the substance to back that up. Does he? No. He puts all his energy in highlighting the natural beauty of 18th century England, and in that sense the movie can be mentioned in the same breath as Room with a View or Howard's End. Elsewhere, though, it's pretty basic, with a story that's been told many times before and has no new twists that can add to its dramatic resonance.The performances are another problem altogether: Knightley might have seemed like a perfect fit for the role and she tries her utter best, but it feels quite theatrical (in a bad way) and overstated, and sh isn't helped by Atwell and Cooper's emotionless staring as support. Fiennes and Rampling, on the other hand, are amazing, especially the former's apparently cold but really entertaining and moving performance - if Bill Murray did period dramas, it would look a lot like that. It's also a bit ironic: the film aims to be female-driven, but is completely stolen by a ma"
Wanted             ,okayristin,1,action,2008,1,"A little bit of a spoiler... In all honesty, I was expecting something...decent. I've seen a lot of movies lately, and I wasn't exactly looking for anything to blow me away, so I went in with low expectations. Where do I begin? I felt like the entire movie was just an excuse for violence. To call this an ""action/thriller"" is quite the stretch...I would have gone with ""comedy/gore"".The music was a bit more serious than the actual plot could back up, and I walked out thinking ""wait, what was his name? where'd he come from?"".At first, it was alright, I understood, they lost me 10 minutes into the movie, picked me back up, then lost me again when he went body surfing on his father?I liked the twist (although I had the turning of the characters pegged from the beginning), all in all, seriously...waste of money.I was disappointed with IMDb users when I saw such a high rating. 1"

But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\Oh.. and I hope this does not count as a spoiler.

I must also admit if it was not for these actors I wouldn't have bothered myself in watching this movie. OK, so my comment so far doesn't justify my rating. But I have a good reason for spending valuable 7 on this movie: Screen presence of Niro and Pacino (Duh!!)Both actors got chance to show some of their usual character traits they are famous for, dark side, shouting, swearing. My God they still got it, they are still as hungry as before and yes they are old and it shows on their body but I mean common, just throw them right script, and right team.Plot was interesting with a good twist, but again not any special.Good attempt by director with occasional use of some witty dialogs. Overall it was entertaining, even more so to see these two performers together. I would not recommend it unless you want to see Niro and Pacino in action together. Sorry guys for very bias comment, but can't help. I just wish to see these two greats together in one movie which will be a pure treat to movie fans.

The Express             ,tavm,,misc,2008,8,"Before I write the review proper of The Express, I have something to nitpick: I know when films are made ""based on a true story"" some events are going to be exaggerated. Nonetheless, I expect most of what happens in those movies to reflect a certain truth and be as accurate as possible. So when I read here on IMDb that the taunts of the Syracuse vs. West Virginia game from WV stadium members NEVER HAPPENED and that the coach that Dennis Quaid played had actually worked near the surrounding areas, that marred some of the enjoyment I got out of this movie based on Ernie Davis, whom I actually read about in elementary school in a literature textbook during the '70s. I wasn't bothered by some other inaccuracies I read about, however, since many of them were more minor and therefore, doesn't ruin the picture for me. The performances of Rob Brown as Davis and Quaid as head coach Ben Schwartzwalder had me riveted for most of the movie and I also enjoyed Charles Dutton as Davis' grandfather and Nicole Beharie as Davis' girlfriend, Sarah Ward. The tragic fate of Davis in the last 15 minutes also was handled tastefully and reading about President Kennedy's eulogy before the end credits was especially inspiring. So despite my misgivings about the whole West Virginia scene, I'm recommending The Express for anyone curious about this nearly forgotten time in college football history. P.S. I was pleasantly surprised to read in the end credits that part of this movie was shot in my birthtown of Chicago, Ill"

Summer Hours             ,paul2001sw-1,1,drama,2011,9,"A film about talented rich people squabbling, albeit very gently, about an inheritance would normally be a candidate to make my hackles rise. But 'Summer Hours' is a sensitive, subtle movie, that explores non-judgmentally what is important to us, and why: in short, how we define our emotional identities. The characters seem likable, but display an ordinary selfishness, and the film lightly samples the passions that make each of them tick. It's a very wordy movie, so much so, it could almost have been a stage play, but the director has a great sense of place, evoking his characters own feelings for place and the movie never feels heavy. In one sense, the ending is a touch underwhelming; but in keeping with the film's overall style. I liked it, a lot: the sort of film that only the French seem to mak"
The Lucky Ones             ,MacAindrais,,adventure,2009,NA,"The Lucky Ones (2008) ***1/2 Here's a fact: movies about the current war in Iraq have done about as well as... well, the current war in Iraq. To be fair, none of them have really been great. Even Tommy Lee Jones' In the Valley of Elah did not manage well financially, though it did manage to get half decent reception from critics. Understandably most of the films have been pretty heavy handed, and just as understandably, audiences have been satiating those taste buds with other, less controversial and subjects. But then comes along The Lucky Ones, starring Tim Robbins, Michael Pena, and Rachael McAdams. The film is about 3 soldiers returning home from Iraq; two on leave for 30 days, the other out for good. Instead of sticking to the usual downbeat tones of other Iraq films, it's more of a hopeful charmer and quite a funny one too. It's really more of a good old fashioned American road movie with soldiers than a war movie. But that didn't stop people from not going. The film got only limited release through 2008, despite gaining fans on the festival circuit.Three soldiers return home from Iraq after meeting each other on the plane ride. When they arrive on American soil to catch their connecting flights, they discover that the airport is backed up solid due to a black out. Rather than wait around, Cheaver (Robbins) decides he's close enough to his home in St. Louis to rent a car and drive. TK and Colee (Pena and McAdams) decide they should join him. They're both heading to Las Vegas and figure they can probably make the drive and catch a flight out of St. Louis by the time they would here.Colee is heading to Vegas to return her boyfriend's vintage guitar to his family. He died in the war. TK is heading to Vegas for some professional help before he meets up with his fiancé. Hookers and strippers? Colee inquires. Kind of - but not for the usual reasons. You see, they all have wounds, but some more sensitive than others. Cheaver injured his back in a not so heroic way, but he's more amused and relieved about it than embarrassed. Colee's been shot in the leg, and sports an unhealed wound and a limp. TK gets the best of both their worlds: he's been wounded by shrapnel in a not so public area. Now, as he says, it doesn't work right. He's going to Vegas to meet with some ""professionals"" to test his own little soldier out. ""I can't go back to my fiancé without knowing it works, we'd have nothing to talk about!"" A strange predicament for two people about to be married.Cheaver, being the oldest in his 40s, is usually something of a father figure to the younger TK and Colee. On their trip those two first bicker before becoming closer. Colee openly talks about her late ex, and tells the tales he told her of robbing a Casino in Vegas to pay off his loan shark debts. TK responds with coldness and ridicules the dead man for his character. It results, inevitably in having to pull over and the keys inevitably being locked in the car.The Lucky One's certainly doesn't go anywhere we really don't expect it to, but the paths it takes to get there aren't necessarily always the one's we expect. For example, given how quickly the trio arrive in St. Louis, it's obvious something will have to happen to keep it going. It's no big surprise to reveal that his wife wants a divorce, though she apparently is not cheating on him. Meanwhile their son breaks the big news that he got into Stanford, but needs 20 grand to secure his spot. So Cheaver decides he'll go to visit his brother or maybe even go to Vegas and win the money. That guitar Colee carries around is actually even worth 20 grand, though he doesn't want it, and she has to give it to her dead boyfriends family. She wants to give it to him but obviously knows she can't, although what she knows about her dead boyfriend seems to be less and less as time goes on.The movie is populated with the usual oddball characters and chance encounters you find on cross country road trips, or in cross country road trip movies. There's a stop over at a church where they meet a very wealthy parishioner who invites them to a party, where among other things they encounter a young man against the war, another man who thinks after meeting the trio there's a good reason why they're losing the war, and a horny wife with the hots for the old Cheaver. Elsewhere they encounter the usual road side bars and motels, traveling sex workers and a rogue Tornado. And of course, along the way each confronts their own issues and demons.The Lucky Ones is a funny and winning little movie. It's above all else a very human movie. The characters are what makes it succeed, not it's story. All three leads give wonderful and sincere performances, particularly McAdams as Colee. She's naive but not unintelligent, and tough but still vulnerable.What could have been a downer filled with cheap shots and cheap tactics is instead smart and even handed, and above all respectful. That's not to say that it's necessarily a ""safe"" movie - but then again a movie that's best described as a road comedy about Iraq Veterans probably cannot be. It's above all else a very human movie. The characters are what makes it succeed, not it's story. All three leads give wonderful and sincere performances, particularly McAdams as Colee. She's naive but not unintelligent, and tough but still vulnerable. The movie ends as the soldiers' leave expires and they must return. At least for now they've been the lucky ones. Here's to hoping they stayed lucky."
"Surfer, Dude             ",geor_20284,0,comedy,2013,6,"What is good about this film? Well if you are one of those people that got sick with overblown action movies or vampire teenage dramas, ""Surfer, dude"" is going to provide you a break. Like the waves though, it is good not to force this movie. It will come to you some day, in the TV, when you are back from work, tired and in need of something laid back. You don't have to spend a penny to see this movie. This is its central message: good things are for free. Well almost, you have to have a TV. Another good think is the view from the almighty ocean. Yes the shots of the sea and the waves will always have a calming effect on us, it is scientifically explained. The long beaches, the sand, the sun, Willie Reed are natural elements that relax us. The good parts of our world. The lead is in most natural, meaning always stoned. I never seen a more stereo typical view of a pot head but with a hint of control in the weed consumption. He smokes it, not the weed him. What is bad about the movie? Well it is not a serious, provocative film for cinema lovers. Surfer, dude is like the guy in school that you know you'll never have something in common but respect his different way of seeing things. The plot is not multi-layered or anything and the ideas are not explained in detail or in depth. Theories and ideas and intentions of the characters are just what it is. ""What is good about surf? What is good about the wind..."" The lines are poor, and the actors are just there, except of course Woody who is always a pleasure watch.If you want meaning, you can find it anywhere. Many say there is no meaning in this movie. Well i say you can find meaning in rock standing still, if you want to. There are simple meanings about capitalism and retrieval to nature and stuff like that. The only meaning is not to over analyze this movie. After all it is one more movie, that talks about not selling out to video games for money and still the movie product is out in the cinemas trying to make some money! In its defense, it doesn't try so much to sell itself with big explosions and romance but it is happy just to be out there. After all it was a bust, selling only a handful of tickets. I watched Surfer, dude last night in the TV and i enjoyed it for what it is. A movie that doesn't expect anything from you and you should do the same for Surfer, dude. Let it be and you never know when it will come to you."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,Benedict_Cumberbatch,0,drama,2008,NA,"When this film was over (saw it on a late show on Christmas Day), I knew I had just experienced one of the most powerful cinematic masterpieces of my life. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is quite possibly my favourite film of the last 5 years (not since Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" a contemporary film had moved me so much). I had high expectations for it, and they were way surpassed (fact: after ""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"" and this, nobody will deny David Fincher and Brad Pitt make great films together).""Benjamin Button"" is the story of a man who ages backwards. Played and narrated by Brad Pitt, BB is the epic account of this extraordinary life, with focus on all the special women that were part of it (Taraji P. Henson as the mother, Cate Blanchett as the love interest and Tilda Swinton as a married woman he has an affair with). As a humorous, romantic, melancholic and visually stunning tale of a sweet-natured man who's different from most people, the film reminds me of ""Forrest Gump"" (which was also adapted to the screen by Eric Roth), but it is even more groundbreaking. It's hard to see a film that has it all, but TCCOBB is one of those. It's like a great epic from Hollywood's Golden Age, when a good story was as important as the magnificent sets (the art direction, cinematography and make-up are all fantastic, by the way, as is Alexandre Desplat's musical score) that populated them <U+0096> something very rare today, when CGI dominates most movies. We had a few great films this year <U+0096> from the king of blockbusters (Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"") to a compelling biopic (Gus Van Sant's ""MILK"") to brilliant indies like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"", Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"", Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"", Thomas McCarthy's ""The Visitor"", Courtney Hunt's ""Frozen River"", Tomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" and Jonathan Demme's ""Rachel Getting Married"", but I doubt I will see anything as good as David Fincher's masterpiece so soon. In other words, an instant classic (there, I said it). 10/10. 1"
The Square             ,billybob49,0,crime,2010,3,"I was incredibly disappointed in this film - I had high hopes for the brothers Edgerton after seeing a couple of their short films over the years.It's easy to see why ""The Square"" didn't reach an audience : a no name cast, who are pretty average (David Roberts one dimensional acting belongs in the cast of ""Satisfaction"" as a john), gummy cinematography and a dull plot of double crosses and turns that don't do more than serve as deus ex machina moments. It's sort of a case of ""this happens ... then someone does this...then someone else does that...etc etc"". It's a long way from being tense & involving. This isn't the Coens. The script needed more work and the shooting style, whilst functional, doesn't create any cinema moments.It would be watchable on TV maybe, but not a movie you'd pay $16.50 to watch on a big screen.Go and rent ""Noise"" on DVD instead."

Hancock             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,0,action,2008,6,"Will Smith. That's all you've got to say, and you're guaranteed a big opening at the box office. Well, from the looks of it, Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film, which is what we get in his latest movie, Hancock. In the hands of any other leading star, Hancock would probably end up being a below average film. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. He can make you laugh, cheer, cry, and even root for his character (who is a total ass, as he is reminded a number of times throughout the movie) no matter what kind of shenanigans he may cause.Hancock is not the generic superhero film and is probably one of the more ingenious ideas to come across a producer's desk in quite some time. To me, what it seems like is that the writers of the film loved the idea, started off extremely strong, and then began to realize that how hard it is to sustain a simplistic idea over the course of a full length motion picture (and it is because of this that Hancock is relatively short). The writers' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing. The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot. The character that serves as Hancock's enemy in the finale isn't even well acted. The person is laughable.This is an action movie, so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie. However, I felt the effects could have used a few more weeks of polishing in the editing room. The camera is also quite crampy. I also have problems with the film's score, as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have. I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film (which is not the end). The action scenes, while entertaining and original, were not long enough to engage the audience like say, The Incredible Hulk, nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted.The film's strength rides on its three stars. Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual, and that should come as no surprise. Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy, and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. Theron is always a sight to behold (except in Monster, lol), and this film is no different. I enjoyed her performance the most, especially in the second act and the beginning of the third. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in ""Juno"". There really isn't another performance to note, and part of Hancock's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters. It should also be noted that the kid who played Bateman's son was absolutely adorable.Hancock is the classic case of great idea, and mediocre execution. I can see this idea being remade years from now, and pulled off even better. It's not a fault of Peter Berg, the film's director, as the real weakness is in the screenplay, which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act. It's not a bad film by any means, nor is it great. It's in between ""okay"" and ""good"". 3"
Kung Fu Panda             ,bennyking81,0,animation,2008,9,"I saw this movie in the Cinema last night. I can not recommend this movie highly enough to kids of all ages. it is a long, long time since i have heard a Cinema audience laughing so much during a movie ( i think the last time was during Gigli!).Finally Dreamworks have managed to surpass the achievements of Pixar. All the elements are beyond anything i have seen in an Animated movie since The Lion King. the animation is hugely detailed and achingly beautiful, the script is the best i have come across in years. the only bum note in this symphony of fun is the fact that some of the immensely talented voice cast are badly underused. i can only remember hearing Jackie Chan's voice 3 times at most. having said that, the movie rests on the shoulders of jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. while playing their parts in a very different manner to each other, both are note perfect. they invest their characters with an energy (Black) and dignity (hoffman) that i could not find any fault with, even if i wanted to, not that i want to.Lastly, i believe that Oogway is the best animated character ever rendered, his facial expressions are hilarious and-surpass any previous attempts to give a character convincing facial expressions (i consider Gollum to be a CG character, not an animated character, for the record).in short, this is an utterly fantastic movie that everyone should watch 9/10"
Hancock             ,baba44713,0,action,2008,5,"Look, I have an idea. Let's make a Superman flick, but instead of everybody liking this Superman-like character, everyone could, like, hate him.Hmm.. interesting. But why would they hate him? Is he a villain or something? No, no. He is..well.. a jerk. He still catches bad guys and stuff, but he, like, insults people, creates a lot of collateral damage.. you know. A jerk.I like it, I like it. He's like a superhero dr. House or something, right? Right. Only less witty and more bitter. We can also make him a drunk.Well... I dunno if it would fly. Perhaps if we could get Will Smith to do the role. People dig Will Smith.I'm with you there. Will Smith, flying around, insulting people.. man, this will be great! Right. But we have to go with it somewhere, we can't just let him do superhero stuff while being a jerk, this would get old pretty fast. How about he somehow gets involved with a PR specialist, who will, like, try to improve his public image? Great idea! And wait..wait.. what if we get that Michael Bluth guy from Arrested Development to play, umm... Michael Bluth the PR guy? -Terrific! We're seriously up to something. Let's write! (scrib scrib scrib... hours pass..) Congrats, we have a hit! Let's celebrate!I'll get the champagne! Umm hold on just a minute...What?I just realized.. this script is only good for about 45 minutes of the movie! Hour tops!Oh no! What can we do? Can we pad it a little?No! It's unpaddable! I even added a female lead as Michael Bluth's wife, it still only added about 5 minutes of the movie. Nope, sorry. This is a dud.Oh come on...Look, look..perhaps we can think of something. Think, think...how do we further the story along, put in, like, some kind of a twist...They are all dead or something?No, no.. how about..(scrib scrib.. hours pass)Hmmm... I don't think this will work. No chance.Why?Just look at it! It's stupid, insultingly illogical, and the ending.. it's horrible. Look, I've greenlighted Jaws 4, so I know what I'm talking about.But, but.. Will Smith.. Bluth guy.. maybe we can get Charlize for the wife...I know! But this stuff... it.. just does not make any sense! The second half is nothing like the first half. It kills the movie! Yeah, perhaps we should just rewrite the whole thing..but..know what?What?Remember ""I am legend""? With Will Smith?Yeees....That one also had a great first half, right? Yes. The first half was good.And the second half royally sucked, right?Riiight...And it still was a success, right? I see.. what you're saying is that a Will Smith flick can have a great first half, idiotic second half and still come out a winner?Exactly!Well it IS kind of late and I'm kinda tired.. What gives, let's do it. Although it *does* sound kinda hancock to me. Btw, how do we call this thing?"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,onionterror1,0,drama,2009,1,"I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of this film before seeing it but there was nothing else good on, so I gave it a try. An interesting idea for a film, that he grows physically younger but mentally develops in the normal way. However, this leads to many inconsistencies in the storyline. It doesn't make sense that Benjamin, when he becomes a father, decides to leave and travel the world. He looks of the age to do something like this but he's meant to be more mature... And when he's an old man in a young boy's body, he has a tantrum like a young boy would, but that doesn't fit the idea of the story, either... When trying to find the point to this whole story, all it comes down to is that we should look after those close to us and take more care of them. Well, that's an original one! To me, it became extremely boring as there is never any deep meaning to it and it just keeps dragging on for far too long when you can see that it's quite a stupid idea to put into a film. The anecdotes in the story, the acting and the direction are all good but in the end, what's the point? "
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,BlackDog1981,1,comedy,2008,9,"I'm not a big fan of Judd Apatow and his recent crop of movies.That said, I got to see ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" April 11 at a preview screening with some friends, and I was impressed. It's a joke movie, but it has a story that pulls you along, and the jokes are outrageously funny. I nearly died laughing. It doesn't try to push the envelope of ""How immature and disgusting can we be?"", which was what I have come to expect from these sorts of movies. It's just funny actors doing a great job of telling a good story that most adults will relate to in some way. It's honest fun, and I wish there were more comedies like this coming out.All my friends enjoyed the film, too (aged 20-27). It's a good date movie, though certainly NOT one for the kids or younger teenagers. 1"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,gloveslaps,0,animation,2008,10,"I have seen Clone Wars twice at the cinema now and I am at a complete loss to explain why there is so much disdain for it.If this is what we can expect from the upcoming TV series I for one am very excited.This movie kept me extremely entertained for 100 minutes. The battles, fights and effect are superb. I enjoyed this effort more than Episodes I & II. It is a must for any die hard Star Wars fan.With all 6 Star Wars films in my library this would be the first one I reach for if I was going to watch one.I hope a poor box office result does not result in Lucasfilm abandoning future Clone Wars features."
Righteous Kill             ,PWNYCNY,0,crime,2008,1,"Does this movie mark the beginning of the end of the careers of two Hollywood legends? Are they finished as major Hollywood stars? Is this the best that Hollywood can offer them? If it is then let us conduct a requiem for their careers. Why do this? One reason: this movie. As soon as the movie starts it becomes immediately apparent that it is a clunker. The acting is uninspiring, tepid at best. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are almost laughably unconvincing in their roles as two police officers with something to hide. Or maybe nothing to hide. At no point does this movie even come close to generating the level of intensity that makes for a good who-done-it. This movie is as dull as a butter knife, as bland as spice-free food, and as empty as a dried-up well. Nothing can save this movie from its inevitable demise to DVD-land and even there it might not do too well. This movie is about as exciting as a lump of cheese. It challenges the audience to stay awake. It tries to peddle a story based solely on the presence of two Hollywood stars who do little to save the story. This movie also seems to have an ax to grind regarding retirement. For some reason, the creators of this movie take repeated shots at the idea of retirement, as if it is something to be avoided. So for anyone who is contemplating retirement or is already retired, look out and hold on to your 401K or your defines pension plan. Is there life after retirement? To find the answer to this question, do not, repeat, DO NOT, watch this movie. One other point, this is the first movie this commentator can recall in which not one but TWO major Hollywood stars take a cinematic dive. Both look tired and both act tired and so, to paraphrase those words of wisdom, if they look tired and act tired then then they must be tired ... and who wants to pay money to watch tired actors? "
The Escapist             ,dbborroughs,,crime,2009,6,"Brian Cox stars and produces this tale of a prison escape. Told out of sequence, the escape parallels the tale leading up to it, this is an often nail biting, often run of the mill story. The thrust of the film concerns Brian Cox who is serving a life sentence, getting a his first letter in 14 years. The daughter he left behind is sick due to a drug habit. Desperately needing to get out and make things right he assembles a group of men to help him escape. Very well acted film that is extremely claustrophobic. Everyone is in everyones face and the walls really are all around. Its a good movie that doesn't always transcend its stock prison bits. yes the escape is stunning, and some of the twists are affecting but I know that had this been told conventionally it wouldn't have amounted to very much (and if you sense that an note of disappointment that the good bits aren't up to the great bits you're right). That said its definitely worth a look on cable or as a rental"
Wanted             ,towards-the-within,1,action,2008,5,"I'll start this with saying that I can't usually be bothered to write a movie review. No matter how good, or bad a movie is? There's far better people than me when putting down their thoughts that so often match my thoughts. However, I'll make an exception with Wanted.--This post will contain spoilers, not sure how to hide them--Walking into the theater, I was more or less certain of what to expect. A bunch of superhuman beings kicking each other's asses. Even though I enjoy cultural and classic movies, I'm not the type that'll go with 'unrealistic, duhh.Am not watching this, this is kiddy stuff'. On the contrary, I dig superhero films. I like unrealistic movies. So, I'll start with my likes for this movie.Likes:-Great special FX. They didn't waste any resources. They tried to make it as impressive and they succeeded. It was far better matrix quality in some scenes. -The main hero was very nice in his role. He fit the role like a glove, he was convincing. One could 'bond' with him and feel for him at certain stages.-Action, Action, Action. The movie's like a fast rolercoaster that doesn't stop for a moment. From moment one, to the end. Chases, shoot outs, more chases, training. It doesn't give the audience a breather, and the audience is happy for it.-Overall, enjoyable in its strong points. Here comes the sad list of dislikes though....Dislikes:-Jolie. I like her. I think she's sexy. I think she was seriously mis-casted. She was trying too hard to put the bad girl look on, which just...Didn't click for me in this movie. Sorry.-Plot Holes : This is my favorite part of it all, really. As I said, I don't mind non-realistic bits, or flying cars, or curved bullets. But, let's break down the movie to a reasonable level.1.'A thousand years ago, a band of assassins was created. to read names, and kill people'Fair enough. In the situation though that only one person reads names. His name could come up, and well...oh wait. It actually happened. Tip: When you got a machine, passing around death sentences, best to have more than a single person at the 'reading committee'2.'You are his son. You're the only one he wouldn't harm'So the master assassin has a son. That he knows about. That all his assassin friends know about. That he's ready to die for. Why not just capture his son, and tell the guy 'Come in, or we kill him'. Seems to me he was ready to die for his son. Oh wait. He did.And if he knew his son was his Achilles' heel. Why did he wait to the end to tell him. Why didn't he just........give him a call?3.'Kill him'Never ceases to surprise. When the death order is passed on the star. Everyone's shooting at him, trying to kill him,with him surviving it. And of course, when he reaches what I'd like to call the 'dialogue area', in our case a circular room? No one tries to shoot him anymore for some reason. Did anyone hear a 'cease fire'? Beats me.4.He lied to you. My father is innocent' 'Is this true?' 'etc. etc.'The big climactic fight. So, let's take maths and statistics into account for this one.One room. One star. One end-boss. 12 bad guys.The boss clearly states to all 12, that he's lied. Once more, beats me why. He could've answered as 'No, I am not lying. shoot him'. End of story. Our hero had no proof, no evidence, whatsoever.Instead, he admits lying. And then tells all the rest that their 'own names had come up'.The sad part, is that all 12 believe him.The nice part, is that Jolie's character serves as proof of the golden world rule.'In a group of morons, their leader outbest the rest'5.'The End Scene'So, we go to the end scene. And Sloan decides (once more, escapes me why as he could do so earlier and in a much more convenient manner), to kill our hero.For being the guy who taught everyone everything they know. I find it kind of sad that he actually had to step two steps behind the poor guy, to try and kill him.Serves him right. Gets assassinated by a bullet from 10 miles or so away.Conclusion : You don't have to give an action movie a plot, to make it a nice action movie. If you bother with one, do put some effort in it please. It's hard to make all characters seem like geniuses, of course. But don't make them look so damned retarded. :)"
Gran Torino             ,flyingtiger08,0,drama,2009,4,"The 4 stars are solely for Eastwood's performance, which was top notch as usual. He is like a fine wine, he only gets better.... As for the rest of the movie, a couple of other reviewers have nailed it, but the multitude of people that gave it anywhere from 9 to 10 stars saw a different movie from me. The rest of the acting in the movie is honestly the worst I can remember seeing in a movie. There are times when there is maybe one actor in a movie who is not very polished, but in this movie, there are actor after actor, scene after scene, where aside, from Clint, I thought I was watching a middle school production. And it wasn't ONLY the acting. The dialogue for a large part of the movie was also very forced, unrealistic, and staged. Not great writing here folks. There are a few rewarding moments, and again, Clint's acting and character are superb, but that is not enough to recommend this amateurish, predictable, and pretty unrealistic movie."
Four Christmases             ,ArthurMausser,1,comedy,2008,4,"The movie has all of the potential to be a great comedy classic, but it seems to have to much Vaughn influence in the writing. Jon Favreau should have taken more control in creating this movie because his character was the best and funniest and we all know he can write a screenplay. Vince's shtick is getting really old and I didn't find him funny at all, Vaughn is becoming very very predictable.Reese Witherspoon is withering and her cutesy faces are not so cutesy anymore. Her lines are humorous but she is not. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight, and Sissy Spacek have solid performances. Duvall was hilarious.However, since Favreau & Duvall have minor roles in this movie, this movie is weak in the laugh department.Usually, I tell people to wait for the movie to come out on DVD or HBO. In this case, don't buy it; if you miss it on HBO or Showtime, TBS or ABC will have it on in 2 years.Too make a long review short, if you miss this movie, your life and your wallet will have more to give."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,LayerCake,0,drama,2008,6,"When I first heard that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's new film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was destined to join the ""sweepers"" at the 2009 Oscars I knew that I had to check the film out to see if the rumors were true. Go back in time a little to when the film was first announced. David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac) was set to direct with a script from Eric Roth (Munich, The Insider) based off of an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story of the same title. The aspects of the crew were locked and had me somewhat interested. Then the cast list was announced with Brad Pitt (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Twelve Monkeys) and Cate Blanchett (I'm Not There., Coffee and Cigarettes) headlining the list, to say the least, it had my attention. I rarely get hyped up for super-mainstream films anymore with all of the disappointments that have occurred in the past. Luckily enough I was given the chance to attend a press screening on December 4th for this film and left well, satisfied. Given the fact that I was underwhelmed by the trailers, being satisfied is certainly saying something.Benjamin Button centers on the life of well, Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). As he states throughout the film, he was born under unusual circumstances. Unusual does not seem fit to describe it. Absurd would be a more suiting for the strange predicament Button found himself in. Born at the same age of everyone else when they enter the world, he had one different trait that stood out like a great white shark in a fish bowl, he had the frail wrinkled skin of an old man. Not only that, all of his features were those of a ninety-year old man. How this happened, the film does not explain in scientific terms but rather labels it as a ""miracle"" which in retrospect, it certainly is. With the outside of an old man, but the mind of a new born, Button had quite the handicap to overcome as a child. He is raised by the loving Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who runs a nursing home establishment. There he meets an assortment of characters that all effect his life in different way although one person seems to have more of an effect than the rest. A young girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is the grand daughter of one of the elders residing in the home. There she befriends Benjamin and their epic tale of love begins.Go into this film with an open minded because you are going to leave with an over flooded one as it is. The story carries so many twists and heart wrenching scenes that the viewer cannot help but become completely engrossed in the film. The main theme in the film is not death, forgiveness or love, but rather life. Life as whole. Every little detail, every experience we have is our life. What we witness is an almost complete documentation of Benjamin's life. One thing that the film did quite splendidly was when Benjamin stated in his narration that a certain person affected his life quite greatly. When the scenes with that person would initiate, the film's pacing would slow down and pay closer attention to his relationship with the person and the changes they caused in his life. A beautiful portrayal of the finer moments in life.Even if you leave the film bitter there is one thing you cannot deny your love for. The technical aspects of the film. The make-up is the best I have ever seen in a film. The age progression of the actors is done incredibly well. Even the actors handled the age changing roles quite well. The costume design is also fantastic and will most likely take home the Oscar gold along with the make-up. Another notable technical aspect is Fincher's direction. He has never been nominated for the ""coveted"" Best Director before but he has a strong chance with this film. One of the film's sequences stands out above the rest as one of the greatest Fincher has ever directed. While I will not go into great detail about it, I will say that it involves a tug boat fending off a submarine and it is incredible. Alexandre Desplat who was the composer for the film creates a score that may not be one of the most memorable, certainly helps in creating the film's atmosphere, which is a poetic one. To fully describe the spell that the technical aspects cast over the film would be nothing short of mesmerizing.While this may not be the best film of the year, it certainly is a film that will be remembered for quite some time. It's not ""flawless"" or a ""masterpiece"" but it is something grand, something magical. A film that can be experienced over and over again. One that does not undermine the intelligence of the viewer by repeating sloppy dramatic sequences that will only end up to the understandable conclusion of happiness. No, Benjamin Button is a film that understands the human mind and revels in it. Producing every bit of love, happiness, depression, confusion, hate, companionship that life provides us with this film is a tour-DE-force on most levels. Come Oscar time, this is the mainstream ""masterpiece"" of the year that is to be reckoned with. I can easily see it picking up nominations in most categories and winning them as well. Like I stated before, it is not the best film of the year, but is one that you should see to experience the wondrous life of Benjamin Button. 2"
Julia             ,gradyharp,1,crime,2009,10,"JULIA is one of those films that goes beyond being a story and production worth the viewers' attention: this is one of those experiences in observing the art of acting at its peak. Tilda Swinton who continues to explore roles that challenge her and her audience, roles that few other actresses would considering making let alone making, and in JULIA she covers a range of emotions and mutations of a character that simply leave the audience in complete awe of her talent. She is extraordinary! Julia is a bright but flawed person. She is an alcoholic who spends her nights drinking herself into oblivion only to wake up the next morning not recognizing her bed partner or the surroundings of her comatosed night of stupor. Swinton makes us understand this character's 'way with men' in her grossly revealing clothes and her flirtations backed by a mouth of filth. Julia loses her job over her drunken tardiness and has ruined a 'relationship' with ex-alcoholic Mitch (Saul Rubinek) and finally goes to an AA meeting where she meets Elena (Kate Del Castillo), a pathetic recovering alcoholic whose only goal in life is to retrieve her son Tom (Aidan Gould) from his wealthy disapproving grandfather. Julia is so desperate for money that she buys into a bizarre 'kidnapping' of Tom for Elena, a decision that triggers all of the rest of the film's journey through crime and sleaze as Julia fails at every effort to 'play the game' of criminal to make a fortune. Traveling from Los Angeles through the desert to Mexico, along the way Julia encounters 'co-facilitators' in her new life of crime - portrayed by such fine actors as Bruno Bichir (Demian Bichir's brother), a new and fine young actor Horacio Garcia Rojas, and Eugene Byrd to name only a few of the standout performances. Though a bit overlong at 2 1/2 hours, the script by Michael Collins and Camille Natta is spot on perfect and the direction by Erick Zonca makes the long film always richly colored and fascinating in attention to detail. But the real reason to watch this film in the astonishing, multifaceted performance by Tilda Swinton, surely one of the finest actresses before us today. Her Julia creates a new level of acting standard- even for Swinton! Grady Harp"
Igor             ,itshappybunny71,0,animation,2009,10,"I really loved this movie. The music, which happened to be one of my favorite types of music, was cheerful, compared to what I expected to hear in the movie. Igor looks as cute and adorable as a puppy with those big eyed. Brain and Scamper remind me of Billy and Mandy from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, with Brain being dumb and cheerful like Billy and Scamper being smarter and grumpy like Mandy. As for Eva, I think she is very pretty for someone who looks like a giant rag doll. I love how Igor changed from wanting to be an evil scientist to a nice person. Also, this movie reminded me of Wall-E. Both Wall-E and Eva had feelings for someone (Eve and Igor), who didn't seem to have those same feelings. At some point, both Wall-E and Eva have been changed so that they don't love, and both Eve and Igor showed how they really feel. And of course, I have noticed that the couples from both movies (Wall-E/Eve, Igor/Eva) have the girl being taller than the guy, which is something I rarely se"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,moritzbonn-1,1,misc,2008,9,"a few words in advance,never could a movie dealing with the RAF reach a high average vote and lead to a general approval. It simply depends on the different emotions according to this topic. Don't forget that some 35 years ago there existed an unbelievable high support among young people for the terroristic organization whereas the majority looked with disgust at the murderers.So watching this movie is simply not more than a check whether the director catches the already existing attitude towards this controversial topic. In my eyes, the optimal way to direct this movie would have to treat it like a partly documentary with many original television scenes connected with the presentation of the characters. What I was interested in was whether this movie is able to place the viewer inside the plot, whether one could feel the atmosphere of this extreme period of German history and whether the presented scenes are consistent with the documents one had seen in television reports before. The movie has definitely come up to my expectations. The characters are just brilliant. It is some of the best German work of acting I have ever seen, every single scenes is so consistent with the picture one has in mind. Almost nothing stays from the line of the real development. The only thing I criticize is the selection of scenes. Maybe, the killers are given to much space to call out their misplaced ideology but neither is their behavior justified nor is any sympathy given to them. There doesn't exist any scope for interpretation about who was right and who was wrong. Furthermore, a few more words could have been given to the victims of the RAF whose assassinations are presented very precisely.All in all, it is a shocking but good movie."
Prom Night             ,ughmazing,1,horror,2008,1,"Okay. So I just got back. Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. I didn't.It's not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this. And it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare (walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing I was surprised about: there was more blood than I thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.The film starts off with Donna being dropped off by Lisa's mom at her house. She comes in.. goes upstairs. Camera pans to her father dead on the couch. Spooky. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? He didn't have a spot of blood on him). Killer comes in, Donna hides under bed, mom dies. She runs outside screaming for help. Killer behind her: ""I did it for us."" Cut to therapy session. This confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. Filler dialogue ensues.THey cut to the chase pretty quick. Few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there). More filler ensues.I'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because I don't want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already. But on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting. People in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience I've never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen. The only death involving any blood was Lisa's, and that was pretty scarce. Her throat is slashed, blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clichéd I've ever seen. Let's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). Mandatory backing-up-into-killer. Check. There's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene, but you've all seen that. Oh, you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). And, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene. Shall I go on? I could.For anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? ""Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap."" These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only likable character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. ""Oh, I just realized the psycho-teacher is here! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? Guess I'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!"" Ugh. By the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone felt any remorse for was Donna's boyfriend (I can't even remember his name- is that bad?), and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clichéd film.There were SOME positives- the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well-shot. But that's about it.I'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few), and Brittany Snow.Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,rudymovie,1,misc,2008,NA,"Being aged, knowing most about the R.A.F story from the news when it happened (1970s) including the events in 1968 (Berlin, Prague , Mexico , U.S.A.) I am much more disappointed in this "" big production' on a major theme in post war German (European) history, than most other critics up till now. If you know little or nothing about the subject, like many younger people, this may seem a "" cool movie"". Just as an action pic, you're right. However, what I miss, is the ideological context in which all this was happening. There is some mention of sectarian leftist groups, we see major mass protests of university students, etc. And the starting scenes in Berlin (visit of Sjah) are the main "" background"" to the "" movement"". (by the way, how many under 30 people knew about the Sjah of Persia, anyway? I even remember first spouse Soraya from the early 60's...). What I miss, is , an explanation of what and how on the mass student meetings, they are just shown. Also missing are the deeper context of postwar BRD (Germany) not having come to terms with the Nazi past, especially in the situation of many former NSDAP - symp's having high places in society, government, industry, etc. As I remember, that was one of the main frustrations in leftist circles ( and not only there...). Etcetera. In this respect, seeing the first gen. members of R.A.F. speeding to an unexplained action in BMW's on the "" autobahn"" as if they were fun-cruising L.A. in a Tarantino muscle-car flic while having My Generation by the Who on the stereo this all is quite unbelievable for people informed about that era. I don't believe these guys were jet-set-emulators. Jet-set was capitalist and thus their opposite social stratum. Which they fought , with all fatal results. And, why the story ending with the death of the first four, how shocking it may be? This whole episode is too much for one movie. As a Dutch proverb says: "" they took too much hay on their fork"". (meaning the makers of B.M. Komplex). genomen""."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,alerter,0,animation,2008,7,"  This will be one of those ""animated"" feature films that adults will drag children along as an excuse to go see, with mixed entertainment value for the tykes.Don't get me wrong, the animation is both storybook stylized and state of the art. The characters' eyes and all emulated reflections and refractions of light are technically excellent, as are the flow of character body movements and facial expressions. (Real world physics are otherwise pretty much ignored, but this is a fairy tale, so no harm done by that.) The face of Princess Pea (voiced by Emma Watson) is an inspired interpretation of Vera Farmiga's (and not a bad choice, even though she was not in the voice cast).All of the other voice talent also deliver better than decent performances. Matthew Broderick captures the essence of youthful wonderment and exuberance in all of Despereaux's lines.If I could pick anyone to read me a bedtime story, it would be Sigourney Weaver... but there is too much use of narration to bridge the gaps between book and screenplay.There is a lot more to honor, courage, heroism and commitment than merely reciting them as a laundry list, no matter how beautifully Weaver repeats the words. The pared down story telling in the film reduces Roscuro's character arc to one of an opportunist with an heart of gold. Roscuro simply switches sides without much self-examination or doubt about his honor, courage, heroism or commitment.I could not help but notice that a lot of the younger kids (K-6-ers) who were present for the screening I attended grew visibly and audibly restless and were, at times, completely lost.When a film engages children, they are brimming with accounts of the parts that they liked the most and want to see again. That was not the case with this film. The film makers were too busy aiming to please the grown-ups, who pay for the tickets, and forgot about the kids. The kids shuffled out at the end in near silence.I think that is an unfortunate shame, because the book is such rich source material, speaking to most age groups. It is possible to keep both children and adults engaged with a good story, without having to alternately play to one audience at the expense of the other. I think kids were given the short shrift.(For adults who have the time and patience, there is a lot of material in the film worth trying to discuss with children, after they've seen it. But that is more of a credit to the book than the film on its own.) Middle school children might better grasp the moral/ethical dilemmas and uncertainties, as boiled down in the film, than K-6-ers. High school students will likely disdain going to see a ""children's"" animation, whereas, many of the characters in the story are acting out what amounts to teenager-ish angst.This is supposed to be a story concerning four ""heroes,"" but the case for heroism is not evenly made. (A press kit I saw listed Princess Pea as the fourth, who was omitted from the IMDb synopsis). Despereaux passes muster (the film would be a disaster if he didn't) with flying colors; but the heroic conduct of the others is dubious, at best. There is also a fifth hero in this story (the Royal Chef, who eventually defies the king's decree against soup), but the promotional materials for the film have overlooked the obvious.In short, I was entertained (but a bit troubled by what was lost in translation from book to film). Kids, on the other hand, were just barely included for much of this ride.There are worse films to take kids to see, but this one could, and should, have been so much more."
Igor             ,Dragoneyed363,0,animation,2009,7,"What I found in Igor was nothing more than pure fun and entertainment. I was delighted every second while viewing it by how interesting and enjoyable it actually ended up being. Though the movie itself isn't the best movie of all time, it tries as hard as possible to be memorable, and even though it was a bit bland and mediocre around the edges, the movie doesn't fail at just having a good time. The character of Igor for me was absolutely unable to hate, and all the other characters are so intriguing as well that they make the film unable to look away from. While this movie did get boring at times, it is just so cute and it has a lot of humorous and sweet scenes. It still of course isn't a masterpiece, but it's a film that anybody in the right mood could have a decent time with and I recommend it if you can appreciate if for what it i"
Street Kings             ,chance84,,misc,2008,7,"I wasn't expecting much from Street Kings, just to be entertained and that's what I got. Keanu Reeves played the part good, Hugh Laurie did exceptionally well, while the worst acting in the movie was from Chris Evans. Chris Evans was wooden and didn't seem to be able to act his way out of a glass box, during the argument in the locker room between him and Reeves I bit my tongue to keep from laughing as Reeves was actually doing a good job. The story was good, flawed and slow in places, but overall good. Sure the movie could've had a better cast but it doesn't and the only surprise here is that Chris Evans was worse than Keanu Reeves."
Lakeview Terrace             ,robertallenandersonjr,0,crime,2008,9,"Lakeview Terrace was a very interesting and original movie. It was exhilarating and fun to watch from beginning to end. The ending especially was edgy and intense. Samue L. Jackson turned in his best performance yet. He nailed the part so well that the movie could have been good just from his performance. He was fun, funny, mean, and vicious. I think this movie should be a fan favorite mostly for young adults and older adults. It was very entertaining. It does kind of start out boring and weird, but then really kicks it into high gear. It kept you on the edge of your seat from the middle all the way up until the end. The movie kept you guessing up until the very last second. The movie is very true in some ways and shows a lot about real life. The movie had great humor to go along with everything. The story was great and interesting. Overall just a very good movie to go see. Entertaining and a very exhilarating ride."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,dfwforeignbuff,0,crime,2010,NA,"Terribly Happy (Frygtelig lykkelig) This Danish Noir Crime film was one of the nominees for best Oscar foreign film 2009 83rd Oscars. It did not win. It is based on the novel by Erling Jepsen. This dark & quirky crime story is set set in a small rural Danish village called Skarrild a town that hides as many secrets as the nearby bog. This Locale is in the only part of Denmark that actually has land adjoining Europe. (the rest are islands) Skarrild South Jutland area is a boggy low lying area north of Germany where the water level is very low. Robert (Jakob Cedergren) has a troubled past in Copenhagen & is re-assigned to a remote Danish town, where he is quickly embroiled in its odd business. Essentially the story of a policeman working punishment duty in the provinces. This dark comedy is reminiscence of Fargo & subject matter is racy with child abuse murder abuse of power wife beating drinking drugs etc. The film is effective, & has a unique feel, though at times it is hodgepodge of genres & stylistic borrowings. The plot (& characters) felt flat & lifeless. The film just did not have the artistic hook that really grabbed me. (Compared to films by fellow Finland director Aki Kaurismaki) The film dour & deadpan film noir but it just did not involve excite or intrigue me. All told heart the film plays like a classic Western: the frontier town, the local bad man, the new marshal, the townspeople, the cute & vulnerable heroine, Ingelise. I hate westerns. Or is this a horror movie?? No is not a horror movie but a comic, ironic witty, well constructed psychological thriller. It still did not make on impression on me. As the story narrows into an increasingly desperate cat-&-mouse game played by Robert & Jorgen following a lethal accident, ""Terribly Happy"" becomes an allegory of human frailty & corruption, of loneliness & the need to belong. If that makes the movie sound depressingly weighty IT IS. How far will you go to have a sense of belonging? 3 star"
The Dark Knight             ,yarden-malka14,0,action,2012,10,"Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like ""Batman Begins"" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be ""152 minutes of pure awesomeness."" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing ""Batman Begins"" will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action."
A Christmas Tale             ,evanston_dad,1,comedy,2009,7,"An overly long and incredibly too talky dysfunctional family drama about a clan reuniting for one Christmas to see which if any family members will have bone marrow that's compatible with that of the matriarch, played by a chilly Catherine Deneuve. She's dying of a rare kind of cancer, and the spectre of that eventuality plus the proximity of brothers and sisters who haven't seen each other for a while and have scores to settle puts everyone in a reflective mood. Unfortunately for us, they stay in that mood for nearly three hours, and they talk and talk and talk endlessly about it.There's far too much plot, some of it quite banal, some of it very interesting. The film is well executed and acted, but it's also distant and cold. I never felt vested in anything that happened to these people, and I greeted the ending with the curiosity of one who has spent a lot of time with something and simply wants to finish it rather than with any real concern for what the ending would be.""A Christmas Tale"" falls into the trap of too many family dysfunction dramas: We all have our own families to deal with in real life, so if we're going to spend 2-3 hours listening to the petty whining of someone else's, it better damn well be worth our time.Grade: B"
Death Race             ,KineticSeoul,0,action,2011,7,"If ""Mario Kart"" was a movie and it had characters similar to the video game ""Twisted Metal"" this movie would be it. I really don't see why critics bash this movie so much, yes it isn't a Oscar worthy movie nor is it a very intelligent movie. But it sure is entertaining and was so stupid to the point it got irritating. People that decide to see this movie should know what they are getting into or else they might dislike it. Overall when I saw this movie in theater I really enjoyed it and had a blast with it, sure some of the plot holes are obvious but this is still a solid thrill ride. Personally I had a blast with this movie and Jason Statham was good in this role since he fit in with his tough guy exterior and I bought it. There is good amount of sex appeal and Ian McShane is just right as well while playing the character named Coach. This is a thrill ride that is like watching a actually entertaining video game movie. However if the script was a bit more intelligent it would have been better though although I didn't expect a solid script from Paul W.S. Anderson.7.4/"
Nim's Island             ,wdashton43,1,adventure,2008,6,"Nim's Island is a tale about a young girl named Nim (imagine that) who lives with her single father on a remote island in the middle of the South Pacific. Because she has no friends or neighbors, she spends her time playing with animals and indulging in the fantastic fantasies of her Alex Rover adventure novels. The stories of the Alex Rover novels are assumedly based on the adventures of the author, Alexandra Rover. The reality is that Alexandra is an introvert hermit who spends her days writing her stories in her San Francisco apartment and talking aloud to the imaginary Alex Rover character. Alexandra and Nim come into contact through email and Nim reveals that her father, who is a scientist, is lost at sea. After much debating, Alexandra gets up enough courage to finally leave her apartment and travel to visit Nim. Once on the island, the girls quickly develop a special bond. With the help of the imaginary story hero Alex Rover, they step into a world of fun and adventure where the line separating fantasy and real life vanishes and dreams become realities (I know that last line was really corny, but whatever).The predominant aspect that enticed me to see the film was the awesome cast. You have academy award winner Jodie Foster as Alexandra Rover, Abegail Breslin<U+0097>who you may remember from Little Miss Sunshine<U+0097>playing Nim, and the star of 300, Gerard Butler playing dual roles as the father and as the imaginary Alex Rover. And yes, ladies, he does have his shirt off in this film.Despite the big names, the cast seemed to lack the necessary chemistry. I thought Butler did an awesome job with both of his roles, but his relationship with his daughter is far from believable. And Jodie Foster, who happens to be one of my favorite actresses, just seems really out of place in this film. Kind of like Subway's Jared eating at Quiznos. Breslin was fine as Nim, but she spends half the movie talking to lizards and a giant seal. That might seem cute to some viewers, but in my opinion she probably needs a psychiatrist, or possibly an exorcist. I would also like to add that someone needs to teach that girl proper running form. Many scenes feature Nim running through the woods or down the beach and every time I watched her run I just started to laugh. With her arms flailing about she looked like Pinocchio running around high on amphetamines or something.I did really enjoy all the fantasy elements of the film, but I think a movie that mixes fantasy with reality works best when the fantasy aspects provide a sharp contrast to reality. In Nim's Island, the normal lives they live are unrealistic which causes the fantasy elements to lose their effect. I mean, who in the right mind moves to a remote island with a ten year old? And how in the world did they get wireless internet service? I can't even get service in my own basement, and they have perfect connection on an island in the middle of no where.Maybe my expectations are too high. Maybe I am too old to appreciate a children's film. Nim's Island is, after all, a kid's movie in the purest sense. There are plenty of corny jokes, cute animals, and moments that will probably touch your soul, unless of course you are Satan. I had high hopes for this film because I honestly enjoy quite a few kids' movies. Who here doesn't like Hook? Or The Sandlot? Or Angels in the Outfield? Nim's Island, unfortunately, did not measure up. Sure I laughed a few times and smiled innocently at some of the scenes, but about half way through the movie I<U+0085>well<U+0085>to be perfectly honest, I fell sound asleep. I think I dreamt about unicorns, but I don't really remember."

The Ruins             ,deadite11987,,adventure,2008,9,"I wasn't too psyched for this movie beforehand, but I got a free pass and figured why the hell not and wound up seeing one of the better horror films I've seen in a good while. Thes best thing I can say about ""The Ruins"" is that it plays its hand honestly, there's no tweeny BS, no winking at the camera, it's just a classic situational horror film that just keeps getting from bad to worse in the best possible way. Like I said, I got in for free and I kinda feel like I owe 'The Ruins"" 10 bucks. But as a small caveat, I saw this film with a bunch of pretentious jackasses sitting behind me and surprise surprise, they didn't like it. So if you fall into that category than do yourselves and anyone who can enjoy a straight shot horror film a favor and stay away. 2"
Surveillance             ,fertilecelluloid,1,crime,2008,1,"Jennifer Lynch's first feature since ""Boxing Helena"" is the worst film I've seen this year. The script is an inept mess and the direction is clueless. The characters are cardboard cutouts with indecipherable motivations. Editing-wise, this looks like a salvage job. FBI agents are investigating a series of murders. Which means they are also investigating themselves. Jennifer is not David, but she tries to be. The problem is, she doesn't have his talent or his ability to create a real, identifiable world into which darkness can be threaded. This is all darkness and all misery. Lynch opts for a cynical, boring, pandering ""thriller"" with no thrills. The violence is graphic at times, but it has no context. Worse, there is not one character we care about. That this sorry nonsense just won top prize at Sitges (over the way superior ""Martyrs"" and the fresh ""Let The Right One In"") is a disgrace, and undermines that fine festival's credibility. Don't believe any hype about this. It's abysmal."

James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in NightWatch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, to-the-extreme film to be seen on the big screen - check this one out!! 3"
Untraceable             ,Ric-7,1,crime,2008,6,"I was not bored and did not want to walk out in the middle of the film, but I guess this is faint praise. I thought the murders were a bit more gruesome than they needed to be, but perhaps that was necessary because the plot was the weakest thing in this film.The story moves along fairly quickly--there is no time to get bogged down in a subplot. The quick pace does not allow time for thinking about whether the various plot developments actually make sense, and whether there are just too many coincidences for the plot to be credible.And the film just sort of ends. The villain does not make surprise encores at the end, nor do the survivors get together for a post-mortem. TG.The performances were excellent. Diane Lane had the right blend of toughness and vulnerability. Billy Burke did the most he could with an rather underwritten character. Mary Beth Hurt was fine (and wasted) in what was just a bit part.This film will disappear from theatrical release soon (if not already), and then enter the home video/DVD market. It's not that horrible--just don't expect The Silence of The Lambs."
Flash of Genius             ,liberalgems,0,misc,2008,10,"This is absolutely the best movie I have seen, so far, this year! I sincerely hope Flash of Genius gets a few Academy Awards! But one thing is for certain! People will be watching this powerful film a 100 years from now! It's that good! When I left the theater and reached the safety of my car, I sobbed uncontrollably! Why? The reason is simple! I can identify with what Dr. Kearns went through, having had a somewhat similar gut-wrenching experience as a whistleblower.I really don't think most people can begin to understand what it is like to stand up for one's honor and to confront a powerful institution, such as a huge transnational corporation, (or in my case a government agency) - no matter what the personal cost.Making matters even more difficult is that many politicians with a conservative bent love to turn the issue of litigation awards into a political football! Oh, how rich and powerful institutions are the ""victims"" of shady lawyers and questionable plaintiffs, they cry! But what these unethical politicians don't tell you is the mind-boggling amount of work that goes into preparing your case before you can even find a lawyer willing to take it! Or, that no matter how serious the injury, there's no guarantee your case will ever see the light of day!This true story is also about love & family! Dr. Kearns is so fortunate to have such wonderful children. It's amazing how much can be accomplished when a human being gets emotional and logistical support from those he loves! Ultimately, I think that's the bottom line, here!"
The Brothers Bloom             ,jaredmobarak,1,action,2008,9,"While the complete polar opposite of Brick, Johnson left the Dashiell Hammett prose and instead decided to delve into Wes Anderson territory. His The Brothers Bloom is a smart, witty adventure that takes some unexpected turns on its journey, never lets a detail fall into obscurity, and shows that if nothing else, he is a high caliber storyteller that should be around for a long time, not rehashing the same thing over and over again, but churning out refreshingly new and unique yarns to entertain and enlighten.This tale is about a duo of con men<U+0097>the best in the world<U+0097>who reunite to do one last job. The younger, Bloom, has been playing the roles written by Stephen since they were children, always embodying the character so easily because it allowed him to be that which was not himself. After having fallen in love with too many marks, only to watch as they swindled and left them out to dry, Bloom is ready to quit and goes into self-imposed exile for three years until his partner finds him and rounds him up for one last big score. That score involves an eccentric shut-in, a woman who has never left her mansion and collects hobbies in order to entertain herself. A master with a deck of cards, juggler extraordinaire, harp player, and ping-pong champ, amongst other activities, there is little she does not know. This epileptic photographer is anxious to go off on an adventure and opening up to the Brothers Bloom is her perfect opportunity to do so, and their best chance at an easy million dollars.What the men did not account for was her inexhaustible sense of enthusiasm and uncanny knack for the con game. Getting herself out of situations that the brothers can't even fathom and catching on to things so quickly, it's as though the mark becomes the professional, however, that is exactly Stephen's plan. She is a woman of intelligence, beauty, and unique without compare. Penelope is exactly the girl that Bloom has been looking for, but of course, she is discovered in one of Stephen's stories, accessible only until they must cut her loose. Yet, here comes the first ""what if"" of the film. What if our orchestrator has concocted this all for Bloom, a con on a grand scale in order to give him the life he always wanted? Bloom does say that Penelope feels just like one of Stephen's characters, but as he says in his defense, ""the day I con you, is the day I die."" We can only hope those words don't become prophetically true.Johnson weaves an intricate shell game for his characters to roam through, crossing paths, discovering secrets, telling lies, and possibly conning each other. No one truly can tell what's real because not only are they unsure themselves, they know that every one of them has the potential to make-up an elaborate scheme to confuse and manipulate. Ruffalo is the true artist at this game, crudely drawing up a plan of attack in brainstorm bubble trees, thinly veiling his tales with inside jokes that a woman like Penelope (Weisz) is well-informed enough to see through, yet too naïve to put together. Straight from the start, a childhood narrated by Ricky Jay, these boys have gotten what they wanted and planned to perfection. Trained by the nefarious Diamond Dog, the men, (Brody portraying the other, Bloom), have eclipsed their master and took the world by storm. Along with their pyrotechnics guru Bang Bang, (Rinko Kikuchi) and a select cast of regular actors (Robbie Coltrane as the Belgian and a great string of cameos in a bar scene early on with Nora Zehetner, Noah Segan, and a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Joseph Gordon Levitt all showing some Brick love), the boys always get what they want. Ultimately attempting to create the perfect con<U+0097>so well planned out and airtight that it happens all by itself<U+0097>this con becomes reality and everyone gets exactly what they wanted.The Brothers Bloom is told in a storybook fashion with bright colors and in-focus frames. Johnson jam-packs each composition with detail upon detail, never shying away from having an important plot point occur in the background, behind a conversation or action by our leads at the forefront. Most times they are jokes, lending some levity to the situation, one that becomes ever more dark as the charade goes along; unexpectedly dark, yet perfectly so. His use of humor infuses a heart into the proceedings and a true bond and relationship between Stephen and Bloom, two men that learn to hate each other at the end of a job, but always come to the others help when needed at the start. You must be diligent to the environment surrounding our actors, as it is just as much playing a role as they, helping a truly bold and intricate story be disguised as a simple one. Very slight on first appearance, it is the fact that it's so well told that makes it seem simpler than it really is. Without any bloated superfluities or weakly handled tangents, this tightly woven tapestry lives on its own at a breakneck speed, culminating with a spectacular final twist, an end that had been building up right from the start in that bourgeois playground during the boys' foster home placement. The Brothers Bloom look out for each other and never let the other down, no matter what damage it may cause to themselves. In the end, they do it all for their brother, anything they can to make the other's life a success. "
Goodbye Solo             ,gizmoray,0,drama,2013,2,"Maybe I missed something in the movie (don't think so) but I found the film very slow moving and consisting of nothing but watching the title characters sleeping, smoking cigarettes and driving a cab and having their daily squabbles. My lady friend and I thought there was too little to justify 90 minutes of inaction for. The scenery at the end of the movie was the best feature. I think people who pay good money for watching this picture are wasting their time and deluding themselves they are seeing a hidden gem. I felt there was little reason to sympathize with the old man He made his bed and he was going to die in it. Solo felt an attachment to him only because of a sense of a borderline vicarious adventure but there was no way he could prevent the predetermined outcome nor do I feel he really wanted t"
The Burning Plain             ,merylmatt,1,misc,2010,5,"I enjoy indie films, non linear plot lines, use of flashbacks to keep you guessing as to what is happening and how it all ties together. I think the actors Charlize Theron, Kim Basinger do a good job with the acting and the film itself is very beautiful. The cold, desolate desert and poor countryside help create an atmosphere of depression, sadness and a desire to run from it all. I get the themes of forgiving, scarred people, flawed people.**Major Plot Spoiler** Here's the problem - I know it's possible for these events to happen, I also know it's a directors right to take liberty with facts to show emotions or something else. However, how likely is it that a teenage girl will kill her adulterous mom, then hook up with the mom's lover's son, run off, have a child, run away from that, then the abandoned girl rediscovers the mother, forgives her and they all move on? It is an interesting exploration into the emotions of the characters, but if a viewer is left approaching this film as a mystery, or admiring its cinematography, then something was missing in the plot - for me, that was credibility"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,ivo-cobra8,0,action,2015,7,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) isn't a bad film -- there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances -- but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies even tough is a bad sequel but it is still good in my opinion. Yes I like this film it isn't greatest film of all time, but for 2008 film? Yes I will take it. Yes the film has more mistakes and flaws but what ever. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will may not be the greatest film of all time, or bad ass like Riders and The Last Crusade but it is still a good film, it is the weakest entry but still a worthy sequel. I love all the tree films and I like this one a lot. STEVEN SPIELBERG and GEORGE LUCAS bring you the greatest adventurer of all time in ""a nonstop thrill ride"" (Richard Corliss, TIME) that's packed with ""sensational, awe-inspiring spectacles"" (Roger Ebert, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull finds Indy (Harrison Ford) trying to outrace a brilliant and beautiful agent (Cate Blanchett) for the mystical, all-powerful crystal skull of Akator. Teaming up with a rebellious young biker (Shia LaBeouf) and his spirited original love Marion (Karen Allen), Indy takes you on an action-packed adventure in the exciting tradition of the classic Indiana Jones movies!In regards to the ""nuking the fridge"" scene, the thing about Indiana Jones is that there are not some good things in all of the previous three Indy films, especially Temple of Doom, so it's not fair to criticize Crystal Skull for having aliens or the fridge nuke scene without also acknowledging all the dumb stuff in the original trilogy, such as Indy either flying off a cliff on a tank and walking away from it without a scratch, or dropping out of a plane on a rubber raft and sliding down a mountain slope without sustaining any whiplash. Obviously, Spielberg and Lucas were inspired by the James Bond books by Ian Fleming, where the main character always escapes near-death situations.As far the ""aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie"" argument goes, Indiana Jones has always been about fantasy and science fiction. I mean, Indy has dealt with ghosts that come out of an ark and spontaneously melt people's faces, voodoo dolls, beating hearts being ripped out of chests through use of magic, and a seemingly immortal knight from the 12th century guarding the Holy Grail, but it's not OK to have aliens?Also, everyone seems to forget what the Indiana Jones franchise was originally about in the first place; it was created as a tribute to old b-movies and adventure serials. This is defiantly my least favorite out of all of the Indy films but its still a lot of fun even though the cgi was kind of bad and although I was kind of interested in the whole alien I thought the ending was kind a stupid when they show the flying saucer but overall I really like it.Famed archaeologist/adventurer Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a 2008 American science fiction adventure film. The rating I give to this film is 7.5/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that get high scores) needs their head examined. 7.5/10 Grade: B+ 1"
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,practicallypeach,0,misc,2008,2,"You seriously have to be into this low brow stuff to like this movie. And it's not even the content that dumbs this movie down. But both the message and the characters are stupid. I'll start with the message. The message is to be yourself and not conform to what other people think and feel. You know why I have a problem with that? It's because when you go to get a high education it's ALL about conforming. That's why you go. To understand someone ELSE'S rules and follow them so you can be successful in someone else's world. Because this is not YOUR world. Right now this is a white man's world and that's not going to change any time soon. If you don't want to conform that you don't have to. But don't try and change an entire organization that was perfectly content with the way they ran things before you came along. 6 or 7 people should not change how an organization of thousands of people operate. That's just reality. This is a dreamers movie. I also don't care for the characters. You've got this white girl with this chip on her shoulder who can dish it out but can't take it. She feels she can make fun of someone and joke around but when someone does the same to her, she goes all ""you ***hole"" on us. I hate that. Girls shouldn't behave that way. If you want to talk smack them be prepared for it to come right back at you. She is part of a group of ignorant teenagers with bad style. The ring leader of this group is violent but can't do anything by himself. He's got to have his friends by his side before beating on someone, which is cowardly and stupid. You can't hold respect for these characters. They are all shallow and idiotic. Honestly only teenagers can identify with this movie. But mature, educated people know that this type of attitude about life will land these characters exactly where they dance: the streets"

Bolt has the audience in the pad of his paw from beginning to end.A white American shepherd who plays a hit TV series' superdog hero, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) leads a Truman Show life: he thinks his superpowers are real and believes that his sci-fi adventures with his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) are serious. When Bolt accidentally strays from the confines of his studio lot world, he embarks on a real-life quest to find his person and protect her from the evil Dr. Calico. He gets into true-to-life troubles himself, encountering genuine characters along the way: a trio of pigeons, Mittens the alley cat (Susie Essman) and fan-hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). Ally McBeal's Greg Germann provides the voice for Penny's scheming Agent, while The Drew Carey Show's Diedrich Bader is the voice for the Veteran Cat.It may be executive-produced by Pixar's John Lasseter and has tinges of his comedy stylings, but Bolt is fully a Disney creation. Having Lasseter on board ensures that the adults in the audience will probably have an even better time than the kids. The animation is impressive, as it delivers the drama and emotion, as well as the laughs and the Fully Awesome action!

W.             ,leitner43,0,misc,2009,3,"Preface: I'm a huge Oliver Stone fan. HUGE. I even wrote a 20 page paper on the relationship between Platoon and the American psyche regarding the Vietnam War. However, .... In his latest film, Oliver Stone forfeits the insightful, truth-driven film-making that has made him famous for normal, good ol' American profit-driven propaganda (if not tabloid fodder for the masses). The representation of Bush and his actions border's on the absurd. I am no Bush fan, but this film seems to be nothing more than a means of gratifying all those who yearn for a simple movie that reinforces, rather than questions, all their ignorant beliefs about very complex issues. Example: Bush recklessly invades Iraq without any reservations. None. His rational, according to Stone, has more to do with his ego and his quest to prove himself to his father. Fact: Even Clinton voted for war in Iraq. The majority of leaders in the US thought that Iraq posed a legitimate threat.The film's motto: ""Hate Bush, and America is not to be blamed."" That is exactly what the Germans did after WWII. As stated, I'm no Bush fan, but this film equates to political propaganda, and I reject propaganda, whether it is from Bush or from Ston"
The Brothers Bloom             ,jay_hovah703,1,action,2009,10,"Rian Johnson has yet again come out of left field with another spectacular STORY driven movie charms as well as engages. In a summer full of sequels, prequels, and unoriginal ideas, PLEASE go support a director who is taking time to deliver new ideas to us, the viewing public.There is nothing wrong with a good action flick, but there is something much better with a well thought out movie that takes us into a beautifully shot world of two con men. The director took the time to compose each scene in a unique fashion so the world we are in is 1 part 21st century and 9 parts timeless. Much like Brick, the story doesn't rely on technology, but it does casually remind us of the decade.I'm not big on Mark Ruffalo or Adrien Brody, but they play their parts well. Rachel Weisz is the typical quirky pixie, but their characters are not what make the movie. Some people are faulting this movie for being predictable and it isn't perfect. (I give it a 10 because I want to impress upon people the need to support movies like this.) Remember though, every story in Hollywood has pretty much been told, but its how you tell it that matters.The brothers bloom takes a typical story of two con men and turns it into a story for the ages."
The Objective             ,grizzlemusic,,horror,2008,10,"This is an excellent mid to low budget Sci-Fi/War movie. What sets this apart from typical mid to low budget sci-fi is the quality of the script/acting/pacing and locations. The soundtrack is also of high quality the music is appropriate. The sound effects are great. The bullets sound great, the explosions sound good. There is a kind of hallucinogenic scene and the sound design is very very effective.This reminded me of Apocalypse Now in many parts. The story of a solder venturing into the unknown to find the unknown. Is this unkonwn an enemy or a friend? The similarity is also reinforced by a narration track from the main character in the form of observations on the Objective.It's a very simple sci-fi story very told well. I was glad to have found this movie and you can tell that this was not just another production but that a lot of heart and love went into all stages of it creation."
Julia             ,Rich359,1,crime,2013,3,"One thing I learned from this film: stay away from AA meetings or alcholics. Sorry, but this is an incredibility stupid and unbelievable film. Everyone associated with AA in the film is really twisted and sick,even the lone person that trys to disuade Julia from kidnapping isn't very forcefull. The crime is taken with as much seriousness as perhaps someone stealing a petty cash account from their job. The film may have worked if it took itself seriously as a character study of how dangerous an unrecovered alcoholic can be, but it elvolves into somekind of chase film that resembles the 1980 ""Gloria"", with ""Gloria"" being a far more pausable film. Also, in Gloria, the main character did not set out to commit any crime, the boy was thrust into her life. Oh, did I forget to mention how nicely Mexican people are portrayed in this film, they are either psychoic or ruthless criminals. Hard to believe in 2009, by a politically correct French filmmaker no less, could an entire counrty and people be treated so shabby. The writers and director should be ashamed of themselve"
The Express             ,merrywood,,misc,2008,9,"In fact, I'm not a football fan, nor even a sports fan at that---this extraordinary movie would have slipped by me except for several reasons: One of them, my friend of some 30 years or so, Coralee Burch wrote a manuscript on the life of the protagonist in this story, real life college football great Ernie Davis. The years that she struggled unsuccessfully to pitch her script are still quite vivid in my recollection because for her it was a heartfelt labor of love. Ernie Davis, the first dark skinned winner of the coveted Heisman Trophy was to her a real life hero and she related to me more than once how he was not just a great athlete but beloved by everyone that ever met him, such was the greatness of his spirit<U+0085>all of that despite the crushing bigotry that Davis faced coming of age in the mid-20th Century America and the brutal treatment and abuse heaped upon him from childhood.The second reason is the actor chosen to play Ernie Davis, Rob Brown. I first discovered Brown in his first film Finding Forrester (2000). He was selected to play the lead opposite Sean Connery in this small, beautiful gem of a film at age 16 and without any training as an actor yet held his own superbly against Connery. The minute that I saw the trailer for The Express and recognized Rob Brown I decided I would see the film, even before I realized it was the story about Ernie Davis.A curious coincidence as well, Ernie's greatest hero was Jim Brown, who played at Syracuse before Ernie and who went on to the Cleveland Browns once again followed by Ernie. Some of you will know the name Jim Brown because he has been an actor in Hollywood for decades. When I was in High School in Hicksville in the track team I recall quite vividly one day watching Jim Brown run a long distance race on the track leaving everyone behind as if they were jogging at a track meet with his High School, Manhasset.Although Jim was instrumental in inspiring Ernie, as it turned out Ernie had an even better football record than Jim in college and might have also matched or bettered Jim in the NFL where Jim is today considered a legendary player. It was not meant to be, however, Ernie Davis died at age 23 of Leukemia just after being drafted by the Cleveland Browns. To this writing I've read more than two dozen criticals on this film and although most critics liked the film not one grasped the meaning of the story. It was not a film about sports or football but about the triumph of the human spirit"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,iza-knap,1,comedy,2009,1,"I'll just start by saying the only reason I'm spending ANY time reviewing this movie is to help avoid poor innocent souls of making the same mistake I did... watching this movie. Or half if it, anyway. It's the first movie I fast forwarded.Honestly, this movie's plot barely moves. Nothing interesting happens, and nothing that's supposed to be funny actually is. The acting completely sucks. COMPLETELY. All they're missing in here is Miley Cyrus and they could call it a party. It probably doesn't help that I'm not fond of neither Kristen Bell NOR Mila Kunis.I just think this is a movie with cheap humour and a shitty writing. I'm glad some people enjoyed it, I did not."

Also, that mocking Russian names like ""Poopchev"" is inappropriate.2) The grandfather fly's birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also needlessly use the word ""crap"" twice.3) The whole movie largely smacks of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda that I thought we, as a nation, were proud to have risen above.In all it's just crude, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to vie"
The Incredible Hulk             ,DICK STEEL,0,action,2008,9,"The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows, it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory. The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk, and in fact I'd appreciate that this movie didn't divert too much away from this primary objective, although it might be more of the same from the first movie. But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability, somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least, an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad, as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone. And the angrier the Hulk gets, the bigger and more powerful he becomes too.And it's not all serious here too, with well meaning humour peppered in the right places, making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe. You'd often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation, well, it gets addressed here with humour. Memorable ines such as ""don't- make-me-angry-you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry"" gets punned away, even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo, together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role, and Stan Lee who's possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever. The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr, while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie, the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD, and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too. A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky turned Abomination, but Captain America? I'll leave that to you to find out.But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences, nor the references mentioned made. It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. In Lee Ang's version, we don't see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn't really call for it, save for a rescue scene, and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love. And that was precisely the winner for me. The Hulk, for all his power and unstoppable rage, could be brought under control by his lady love, and that was used to great effect here. Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life, but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him. Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart, one who can only admire the other from afar, and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection. And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too, and is not really your classic damsel in distress.Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional, The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments, and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices. As with the Marvel movies to date, the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups, and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from, and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too. It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance, and let the action go into overdrive. HUlk Smash indeed, this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office, for fans and non-fans alike to be won over, just like how Iron Man did. 1"
Pathology             ,teresaband,1,crime,2008,4,"Now this looks great on paper. The core idea revolves around a group of pathology interns playing murderous games after dark. Commit the smartest murder you can, submit it to the group who then have to work out how you did it. There's a quality idea in there and plenty of opportunity for a gritty and intelligent thriller exploring the darker side of our naturally murderous psyches. It's pretty obvious that's not what the writers of ""Crank"" are going to give you though.In practise it all feels a tad eighties, like a cross between ""Flatliners"" and ""The Lost Boys"", and when the edgy bad boy pathologists are roaming the halls it's like the brat pack never went away. However, where Keifer Sutherland's pack of vampires were an understandably seductive prospect, it's impossible to believe that all it would take was some gentle bullying and a hint of potential lesbian action to turn Milo Ventimiglia's posh grade A super student into a murderous crack addict.Still, suspend your disbelief and that's forgive-able. There is some good fun here, particularly in the performances which are all pretty decent, and things (ahem) perk up whenever Alyssa Milano is on screen. The main problem is how hard the movie tries to be adult, and the constant swearing, rutting and drug use has a whiff of ""Hollyoaks In The City"" desperation about it. It's such a constant barrage that it becomes, well, a bit dull unfortunately. Shame, there's a good movie in there somewhere and with a defter touch and a bit more maturity this could have been pretty special. "
Mamma Mia!             ,jcvamp,1,comedy,2008,1,"I couldn't watch all the film, but this is my understanding of the story line. The character played by Meryl Streep was a slut who slept with three guys. Her daughter doesn't seem bothered by this and starts singing about it as though it's romantic. She decided to write to all three men, inviting them to her wedding, so that she could find out which one is her father.Every situation is summed up with badly sung and choreographed ABBA songs presented in a style that's corny even for musicals. The film couldn't even have been salvaged by using people who could actually sing. The female characters also have the habit of greeting each other in the most embarrassing way possible. I watched the film because my girlfriend likes it, but I had to stop watching because cringing was hurting my head. I had low expectations of the film, but I was willing to give it a go, and I was actually disappointed. It has actually ruined some ABBA songs that I previously liked.The acting was terrible, the singing even worse, the choreography nonexistent, and the songs seemed to be placed at random."

Righteous Kill             ,Quinoa1984,0,crime,2008,6,"Righteous Kill is a kind of prototypical modern cop thriller that has the intonations of a neo-noir mixed in with some iconic figures. The script, in a way, is much better than I might have thought, and the actors- stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, in a film technically for the third time and for the first time technically in the frame for more than a few seconds (a pressure obviously from those who whined about their bit at the diner in Heat) as well as the likes of Brian Denehey and Carla Gugino- do their best to make it an entertaining ride. And for all of its recycled elements and plot turns and tough-guy take-no-s*** dialog, it's a fun ride for what it's worth as far as substance goes. You want to see what will happen with these two veteran cop characters as they delve deeper into this killer case (somewhat ripped off from Magnum Force, or something like that in terms of the victims), and what the ""twist"" will ultimately be.For those who might think it tired or stiff, I wouldn't put any real blame on the stars, or even Gerwitz's (flawed) screenplay, which does occasionally pull off dark and funny banter and some coarse dialog and action and thrills to the degree that one saw in his Inside Man script. The problem mostly was the direction; Jon Avnet is not a visionary, nor is he a really well-suited neo-noir director. He's just a competent technician (if not veerying close to outright hack) enough to dig up a few potent bits or visual touches, and mostly tries to make the film ""hip"" and ""fresh"" and ""inventive"" with the approach to style in the flashbacks, and he doesn't possibly bypass the pitgalls in Gerwitz's script. What is pleasing, ultimately, about the picture is that it's not bad at all, and is actually a good movie. But with characters played by near generational icons dubbed in the film as ""like Lennon and McCartney"", this isn't quite up to their previous snuff together. They deserve just a little better with the likes of Godfather 2 and Heat to their previous collaborations."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,Chris Knipp,1,misc,2009,7,"There are plenty of previous movies about this most famous of European terrorist groups of the 1970's. J. Hoberman of The Village Voice mentions notable ones by Fassbinder, Rainer, Hauff, and Schlöndorff, points to Gerhard Richter's important 15-painting installation, and calls this presentation ""by contrast...an extended footnote."" If a footnote, it's extended indeed: it runs two and a half hours, and it may be one of the most elaborate series of recreations of violent political action ever put on film. Made from Der Spiegel editor Stefan Aust's book-length study, it's a very comprehensive account and and this very strength is also a flaw: because it's such a detailed survey, the film therefore also lacks clarifying focus, or depth in portraying any particular individuals or events. Not having seen any of these predecessors except part of the Richter paintings series, I use as my comparison Bellocchio's 'Good Morning, Night'/'Buongiorno, notte.' A rather surprising approach to filming the Aldo Moro kidnapping, it takes us long and deep into the kidnappers' claustrophobic world and has a haunting mood, a sense of what it's like to be trapped by suicidal commitments. It also shows better than this film how a single grand terrorist exploit could hold a whole nation in its feverish grip.No doubt that the actors playing journalist-convert Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck), the lawless hipster revolutionary Andreas Baader (Moritz Beibtreu) and Baader's paramour Gudrun Ensslin (Johanna Wokalek) have the right stuff to convey the wild conviction and psychoses of the time. These three, plus the police chief played by Bruno Ganz and a young Turk played by Vinzenz Kiefer, are the only characters who emerge vividly as personalities. Gudrun's love for Andreas is simply but deftly conveyed through all the wreckage and violence by the way she calls him ""baby."" Meinhof is a sympathizer whose motherhood and respectability hold her back, till she is the decoy and manipulator in an operation to spring Baader from prison, whereupon she jumps out the window with the others and becomes and outlaw. Later (perhaps because lacking full commitment?) she gradually loses her sanity during a long period when the principals are all held in solitary confinement.Lots of stringy hair, bad clothing styles, too much lipstick and eyeliner and perpetual cigarettes add to the period flavor. One of the principals even lights up during an intense shootout with police. Ganz's wily, cool-headed police chief seems to have ideas Americans of the last decade are incapable of: he says more than once that terrorism won't end till the situations that lead to it are removed. Vietnam, the Palestinians, and a series of other injustices are presented as context, not to mention such Sixties American violence as the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and M.L. King. This is a film rich in political reference -- but without much clarification of the group's political motives or their relation to strategy. The original group begins by blowing up a department store, and robs three banks in a ten-minute period. Robberies, bombings, and kidnappings are their M.O., and decisions often just seem to flow out of firecracker Andrea Baader's macho screaming fits. When in doubt, he usually throws a chair. It's not entirely clear how devilish derring-do morphed into leadership. But what is clear is that the opposition is former Nazis or their sympathizers, and the new terrorists, committed to preventing fascism from ever returning to Germany, are the offspring of parents who were anti-Nazi all along. The group calls itself RAF, the Red Army Faction, and Chairman Mao is a guru, even if his dicta are only rarely cited.The opening scene of the film is a jaw-droppingly complex and violent production number: a large street demonstration in which fascist supporters of the Shah of Iran face leftists. The Shah supporters begin a bloody attack on the leftists using the wood poles that held their posters, and the police join in, bashing leftists; one gets shot. Tumult and excitement continue unabated thenceforth; in the first half, there are few pauses for breath. A notable one comes when Gudrun invites a young rebel just escaped from juvie, Peter-Jürgen Boock (Vinzenz Kiefer) to strip and join her in the bath, and Baader comes in and isn't bothered. Peter-Jürgen will become a leader of the second or third generation Baader Meinhof, who arranges Arab collaboration in the Lufthansa plane hijacking to gain the leaders' release from prison, which Baader disavows because it jeopardizes innocent passengers. (This is not the first Baader Meinhof contact with Palestinian fighters; Baader's earlier ones wind up not being very friendly.) We see how it transpires that the German police declare terrorism in Germany to have been safely eliminated, only to be proved very wrong when the 1972 Munich Olympics lead to the slaughter of the Israeli team.One question is if you can root out terrorism. Another is whether terrorism accomplishes any positive goal. The film doesn't allow us much time to think about any of this. What it does do, and does with obvious accomplishment and at considerable expense, is provide vivid images of this violent segment of the period. And it lets viewers judge for themselves, neither moralizing nor sympathizing"
Good Dick             ,sobeit712,1,misc,2009,5,"To be honest, I'm rather divided by this film. On one hand, I'm intrigued and fascinated by the characters, on the other hand, I'm slightly disturbed.There's not much story here. Basically, a young video store clerk became obsessed with a rather weird and introverted woman who is a frequent customer. And then he decided to stalk her.Fair enough, we all have had weird crush on certain somebody we met in our lives and we all may have mentally stalked someone. But to act it out like in this movie is rather disturbing. The movie turned it into a rather awkward but nonetheless sweet love story, but in real life, who knows how ugly it can get.Both characters have some severe issues which I won't spell out the specifics. Suffice to say that we all have some personal demons that made us do some stupid or weird things or act in some unhealthy ways. That's why at some level, I can relate to certain scenes or certain dialogue. On the other hand, to put it bluntly, the two main characters in this movie are pretty sick mentally. When I say sick, I didn't mean they are disgusting or anything. I basically meant that they are not healthy.There's a major problem with this movie: it basically copped out in the end by cheating its way out with a rather cliché ending. But I assume it's the only way out by then, since both characters, though likable, are so damaged to the point that it simply can not be fixed within two hours.If I had watched this movie few years ago, I would be totally lost. Now after going through some really messed up things and messed up people, I am able to understand the characters in this movie. Trust me, I am sympathetic to the girl though I find her to be a lost case. To our stalker boy, he's an emotional train wreck with criminal potentials. This movie, save the ending, can be a great case study for a shrink.Though I enjoyed the movie, I have to say that the mind behind this movie is rather disturbed as well. That's probably why she's great too as the female lead. I got a feeling that she playing herself to a great extend."
Wanted             ,gingepie,1,action,2008,1,"Words cannot describe how awful this film is.Imagine if you will, a hat full of random cgi-heavy action scenes. Spill them on the floor, and select the ones that turn upwards. Then edit them together so that they are almost coherent. This is WANTED.In the first five minutes, you think that this will be a film to rival the Matrix, with CGI action that will blow you away as some guy (its never revealed who he is) leaps across from one building to the opposite one and kills five guys on a rooftop, before being killed in spectacular fashion.Then the film begins.A sad pathetic human starts moaning (for far too long) about how his life is crap. This occupies a lot of celluloid, and you start to think ""where has the action gone"". After some time passes (I forget how long) he joins a fraternity of assassins led by Morgan Freeman. Here he learns that his father (who has been absent all his life) was an assassin and can bend bullets round corners (a trait shared by both Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, but its never explained why) and other cool looking stuff. So after some ""training"" (getting smacked in the face a lot and doing some knife training he never uses) he does a couple of (rather impossible) missions.At this point you think ""this isn't that bad"", and you'd be right.Its when Morgan Freeman reveals that the fraternity kill orders come from a bit of cloth on a loom, that things go downhill. Are we told why the loom wants to kill people? No. Maybe it's an evil loom.Now I was expecting a ""shadow organisation"" that was controlling things and the main characters father was behind all that. No.It turns out that Morgan Freeman has been lying about who the loom wants to kill and that it wanted to kill him (and every other member of the fraternity, again, never explained why) so Angelina Jolie kills all the fraternity members (who just happen to stand still long enough for one bullet to go through them all in a circle: considerate) and herself.That leaving Freeman and Mcevoy (?) to battle it out (or not). In fact, the same sequence from the first bit just happens all over again.It should be called Plot Wanted.Just goes to show, cool looking trailers do not a good film make. "
Righteous Kill             ,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,0,crime,2008,2,"Shameful.So many people are wondering, on this thread, WHY do some great actors, as Pacino and De Niro, accept such compromises. I must confess that today, at the press viewing, most of my colleagues, the best movie critics from Romania, were remarking about the same thing. Of course, we know why they do it - not necessarily by greed. They have contracts, obligations, all kind of sundry reasons to accept such routine work in movies with zero value.The script here is very awkwardly written, with a messy structure and a total lack of dramatism. Even worse, it's completely predictable. The intended ""false lead"" meant to deliberately confuse the audience is so transparent, that everybody can guess from the first fifteen minutes the so-called ""theater coup"" in the end - and so, while waiting for it, friends and neighbors, what a bore! Limp pacing, flaccid storytelling, an absolute impotence in building-up the suspense... And as if this wasn't enough, the final scene is impossibly prolonged, diluted and tacky...By the way, did you know that even great artists like De Niro and Pacino can act BADLY? In this all-over failure, they are outright unbearable! Their characters are simplistic, uninteresting, shallow, so the poor big stars quickly fall into what became their worst mannerisms - Bob De Niro, mainly, so full of grimaces and squinting... Even Jack Nicholson, in ""The Bucket List"", was an itty bitty better! A piece of advice: if you really HAVE to view this, carry on a thermos full of hard bitter strong coffee. AND ear-plugs, not to hear the snoring all around you. 1"
Frozen River             ,Michael-70,1,crime,2008,1,"I generally try to find something positive to say about a director's first film. But I can't with Frozen River.I have no doubt that writer/director Courtney Hunt is passionate about her story and characters, but this film is so ludicrous, so completely unbelievable and the characters so unbelievably stupid that I felt insulted watching it.I know there are people in the USA who are desperately poor. I'm not being cavalier, life isn't always easy and I have no problem with films that want to show that, but making a whiny, dumb film about stupid people is of no help to anyone.An overwrought Hollywood melodrama is more instructive and socially redeeming than anything in Frozen River. You want to make a serious cinematic statement? Then make a serious film Goddamn it! Not a laughable collection of idiotic moments strung together to run 97 minutes.As Frozen River begins, we meet Ray (Melissa Leo) sitting in one of her two cars crying because her gambling addict husband has run off with money she was holding as payment for the delivery of a ""double wide"" trailer.Right on cue, the double wide arrives and Ray has to explain that she doesn't have the money she promised. Then, trailer delivery person said something that hit me hard. He mentions that this is the second time that Ray has ordered delivery of the double wide and for the second time, she has not had the money she owes.Am I to understand that Ray is so dumb she doesn't realize that reneging on a deal means you don't get delivery of the goods? Her own teenage son notes that it was really stupid for Ray to have hidden the trailer payment in the glove compartment of her car. Apparently, this is not the first time Dad has run off with household money to gamble. I understand that Ray is among the working poor but is she really so bad off that she can only offer popcorn and Tang as supper for her kids? Isn't there any welfare or Food Stamps in New York State? How about a Salvation Army soup kitchen? What about a ""Faith Based"" initiative in the area? Is there really no one who can help?While I was trying to figure this out, we meet Lila (Misty Upham), a Mohawk woman who steals one of Ray's cars and drives it back to her small trailer in the woods.Ray follows her and confronts Lila by brandishing a gun. Ray threatens to call the State Police and report this car theft, but Lila laughs at this saying the State Police have no jurisdiction on Mohawk land.What? The NY State Police have no jurisdiction in dealing with a felony? Yes they do! There is such a thing as the Tribal Police, but they have only limited authority and the State Police are obliged to investigate any felony, including auto theft. Even on Mohawk land. Look it up, I did.While I was trying to process this legal idiocy, Lila, apropos of nothing, tells this strange white trash woman with a gun, whose car she has just stolen, that she is a smuggler of illegal aliens across the Canadian border and wants her help because her car has a trunk that can popped open from the driver seat. And Ray agrees to do it! We can understand why Ray helps in the smuggling, she is getting good money; less clear is why Lila does it. It has something to do with Lila's bitterness at having her child removed from her custody by the Mohawk tribe.Although the film NEVER explains why this was done, just think about it for a minute. The whole tribe decided that the baby would be better off without Lila. If we are to accept the Tribal Elders wisdom in other areas, don't we have to accept it here as well?At this point the film becomes intolerable. A few very annoying observations, why is every character in a bad mood or grumpy? Why does the trailer salesman schedule Christmas Day as the day for finalizing the deal for Ray's new double wide? Christmas Day?Here's a mystery, we are told many times that Lila has bad eyesight and can't work because of it. Her vision problems can't even be helped with glasses, ""they make me car sick,"" Lila tells us. Her eyesight is so poor she can't write legibly or even count the money she gets from her smuggling activities; she has to ask Ray if a particular bill is a fifty or a twenty.But then later in the story, when Ray and Lila are looking for a discarded duffle-bag on the frozen river, Lila finds it by seeing faint tire tracks, on smooth black ice, at night, from a moving car. Huh?This film actually made my brain hurt. Remember, just because you have an important topic and a serious purpose, that does not mean the film you make is important and serious.Personally, I like characters that are unlikable. I mean, neither the Godfather nor Hamlet are very likable characters; but they are at least interesting characters. I have no problem with dumb characters either, Jerry Lundegaard in Fargo was a first class dolt, but he was as fascinating as he was pathetic.I did not care for any of the morons who populated Frozen River and I was reminded of the cruel truth that some people really do deserve the hard luck they have.When the only enjoyable part of a film is a scene where an infant stuffed in a duffle-bag nearly freezes to death on a frozen river, that should give you an indication of just how incredibly dumb and inept the rest of the movie is."
Fireflies in the Garden             ,msmspacek,0,drama,2008,8,"I agree with Raj Doctor, although I would rate the film higher.The film was released in Russia with little publicity and became lost in the summer blockbusters. Without revealing information, the acting is excellent. The story is very indeed very realistic. If you find realism boring, then this is not a film for you.The final third of the film, however, is missing. I have read that at the Berlin Film Festival, where the film premiered, it was announced to be 2 hours long, but the version in Russia is missing 20 minutes. Because the ending felt rushed while the rest of it was very well controlled, I cannot help but believe that this time was taken out of the final act. It's a shame really, because it could have been a great film. As it is, it is still a very good film that I recommend for the patient viewer."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,0,animation,2008,6,"The original Madagascar film was one of my favorite animated movies of the decade because it was very original and outright hilarious, in addition to having the most amazing penguins the world has ever seen. In the second installment, however, the screenplay is sacrificed for better animation, and while it looks good, the film doesn't carry itself well, despite having a very short runtime.Our favorite zoo animals have been kicked out of New York and end up in Africa, where they quickly fit in with a pride of lions and other animals. Basically, from here, the film because formulaic, even for a children's animated movie. It's hard to believe they spent almost 3 years making this movie.Of course, most animated films are only as good as the voice actors, and while the big four of Stiller, Rock, Schwimmer, and Pinkett Smith are enjoyable, it's Sacha Baron Cohen who steals the movie once again as King Julien. His performance had me laughing on end for most of the movie, and I lit up like a lamp whenever his little rodent appeared on screen. The late Bernie Mac was also fun to have in the movie.The best thing about the movie are the penguins, bar none. They literally had me crying tears from laughing so hard. The actor playing the lead penguin is some sort of genius. I kept wanting every scene that played out in a straightforward way to end quickly so I could see the penguins again.Madagascar 2 is as beautifully animated as it is horribly written. There is so much attention to detail, making it the second most accomplished animated film this year in terms of picture quality. However, Madagascar 2 falls victim to cheesy lines, a stereotypical villain (a ripoff of a character played by Alec Baldwin, if you ask me), and formulaic plot resolution. I will say, however, that most of the jokes were good ones.Madagascar 2 is a tolerable kids movie that doesn't live up to the first film's glory as one of my favorite animated films of the decade. It's not terrible enough for me to hate it, or for me to not see the 3rd one that's already in production. I just hope that one tries a little harder in the writing department."

35 Shots of Rum             ,MartinTeller,0,drama,2012,NA,"I liked everything about this movie. I liked spending time with these characters, and the performances were spot on. I liked the moody aesthetic of the film, the music (I haven't heard ""Nightshift"" in YEARS!) and the cinematography fit beautifully. I liked how the relationships between the personalities gradually unfolded and revealed themselves. But the operative word here is ""like."" Although I can't find anything to criticize, I can't find anything that deserves exceptional praise either. It's a thoughtful movie, it's a nice movie... it's a good, solid understated drama. It just wasn't anything more than that. I often wondered if there was some subtext I wasn't picking up on, which is highly possible.

Kung Fu Panda             ,AshokePrabha,0,animation,2008,9,"Saw this movie today. It was both entertaining and imbibing good values. For kids a definite watch. For adults too.The story is a well known moral story of don't judge by the appearance. It is about a Chinese town in the valley where a kung-fu rule is about to be seized by a evil spirited tiger who wants to become The Dragon Warrior, the great. And a Panda comes in his way to achieve it.The script is very good. Dream works artwork team has proved one more time. It was very funny from the beginning to the end. And some philosophical moments too. The music and colors used in the movie reminds Chinese in every aspect and mainly kung-fu. It no way is lesser than ordinary kung-fu film. Kung-fu fight scenes drawn with such a clarity. Colors used are mostly red and yellow. Some flash back and magical related scenes have been drawn to bluish grey. The effects came out were extremely good. My credit goes to directors who could imagine the whole thing in their minds to make this film.Animation films have been reaching new dimensions. Though this one did not create any new dimension but will be still one among the classics. Liked a few 'Zen'nish philosophical lines of the Master Turtle character such as 'there are no accidents'.. ""i am the big Panda'..'past is history... future is mystery... and present is the only gift you have that is why they call it as 'present'...they have most profound meanings which the film could casually spill it on its way.Ver good movie.

Summer Hours             ,johnnyboyz,1,drama,2013,4,"We've sat through various characters contemplate decisions on screen throughout the history of cinema. Some have been more heart-breaking than others, others have been measured and contemplative  most have gone on to greatly affect these characters as well as those around them. We've witnessed the titular Umberto Domenico, in a 1950s Italian film entitled ""Umberto D."", face a terrible predicament wherein he may or may not have to say goodbye to his faithful pet, whom he loves and has spent the best part of post-War Italy following him around as a lone companion. Others have been more reflective, and much more recent. We've observed a character very few people have anything bad to say about in Jules Winnfield, Samuel L. Jackson's African American hit-man in Tarantino's 1994 film Pulp Fiction, go through a dialogue driven sequence wherein Winnfield weighs up what he's doing in life through an absorbing exchange. We've seen characters snap, the likes of Bickle deciding to do what he did and we've seen decisions act as the centre piece of a film's drama as twelve angry men go through the motions to reach one of two conclusions: guilty, or not guilty. Now witness a film whose sole purpose is to revolve around rich, intelligent, successful middle aged people torn between keeping a bunch of artwork and remaining rich or selling it all and becoming that little bit richer. Witness Olivier Assayas' film. Witness a stain on French cinema. Witness entering a hundred minutes of cinematic Hell. Witness Summer Hours.Yes, it really is that bad; that trudging; that frustrating and that ill-conceived. It's not that Assayas doesn't have any material with which to work in Summer Hours; on the contrary, he has a large family beginning at the top with its eldest member, in Edith Scob's Hélène, which fritters down to the infant grandchildren by way of sons and daughters and their marital partners  it's just that he resists doing anything with them, and resists taking them anywhere. People SPEAK of travelling great distances, or going places, but little is actually ventured nor really learnt. We begin at an isolated summer house with each of these respective relatives enjoying the birthday festivities to that of Hélène, their host. This woman still lives in the old family home, and coming back for these summer functions is a home-coming for her now adult children. In the home is her vast collection of art and paintings, something she speaks of enthusiastically  for her sons and daughters, one assumes seeing them again brings back an odd nostalgia one can often have for art, perhaps films from one's childhood. Perhaps they don't, the idea that forms of art can induce these sorts of responses regardless of its form isn't explored.Assayas wastes away a solid forty five or so minutes during this opening, and how one could claim that he has done anything else other than waste our time would be extraordinary. These people sit around, they talk; they eat; they loiter with their life partners; they smoke  we can only snooze. It is quite extraordinary, in fact, just how little happens with so many people on screen  there is no narrative, no attention to character and the family all seem to get along with each other quite well. I think a point is made as to how spread out Hélène's offspring are, in terms of what they do and where they work - Juliette Binoche's Adrienne works in America for a Japanese company, while another son has work opportunities in China on the horizon which will result in holidays of what's he doing now, only in the likes of Bali. Thus, the juxtaposition between a more modern world, where no one really needs to belong anywhere; borders become greyer by the day and nationalities of companies, people and where they're based might as well be anywhere, with little old Hélène in her old manor house from a time that was simpler and more grounded, is made.Again, with little exploration  why should we care? It has these pretensions to be about changing times but in essence, just comes off as a total bore that's grossly misjudged in its application of this grounded approach and desire to spread out the character study to as many people of this family as possible. The event kick starting whatever study or chain of events Assayas thinks he's telling arrives with Hélène's death, something that instigates talk between the siblings of selling the old family home and the treasures therein; a decision to sell off these people's childhood at a time in their lives when they've already started families; moved abroad and riddled themselves of their infant-hood anyway. What little conflict there is arrives in the form of Éloïse (Sadoyan), a younger sister to the bulk of the kids who doesn't have as much of an input and would be truly victimised should the property be sold. It is quite remarkable that the film's central dilemma sees these people bickering with one another over whether earning extraordinary amounts of money through the selling of these things, or continuing to live the affluent lifestyle they have anyway, is at the core of proceedings. To say it is monumentally misjudged is an understatement; to say that it's a mite offensive would be to tell the truth, so say that a film is offensive AND boring would be to accuse a project of perpetrating a crime against cinema. Unfortunately, Assayas has done exactly that and bestowed upon us a crime for which few punishments would be enoug"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,gradyharp,,adventure,2009,NA,"For those who find it difficult to appreciate the adaptation format of film making from a famous novel, THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH as now released on DVD should help explain the naysayers' opinions. In a very valuable session of conversations among Michael Chabon and Rawson Marshall Thurber (screenwriter and director) and the producer and cast, the transition of this complex novel into a very altered story is comfortably explained and the person most happy with the result seems to be the originator - Michael Chabon! That being said this film stands well on its own terms. June and July in hot Pittsburgh generate mysteries among a variety of people, especially the young college graduate Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) who while working in a bookstore wastes time with a fling with the supervisor Phlox (Mena Suvari) with disinterested post grad classes dealing with becoming a broker and having monthly dinners with his mobster father Joe Bechstein (Nick Nolte), until he encounters an odd couple: bisexual biker and thief Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) and his female consort, the violinist Jane Bellwether (Sienna Miller). The bizarre interactions among these characters drive Art to make many decisions and discoveries - including his falling in love with both Cleveland and Jane. The summer winds down with Art finally discovering his own identity despite the clouds of mystery that have surrounded his life. It is a piece of life as lived by disparate characters whose direction in life seems at odds with the natural flow of finding happiness and success. But then the question is asked - what is happiness and what is success if not survival? For this viewer the explanation by the makers of this film was interesting enough to encourage a repeat watching of the movie. A good movie not a great movie, but it still tastes strongly of Michael Chabon's genius. It deserves more attention than the critics have given it.....Grady Harp"
Frozen River             ,Turfseer,1,crime,2008,3,"Here's another Indie with lofty aspirations as an art film. It's an original story: Ray (played by Melissa Leo), a mother of two children has just had her gambler husband run off with the down payment on a new trailer she was in the process of purchasing. She lives in upstate New York right near a Mohawk reservation. A Mohawk Indian woman (Lila) tries to steal her car and they end up becoming partners smuggling illegal aliens from Canada. Ray drives her car with Lila over the frozen river inside the Mohawk Reservation and picks up the illegal aliens on the other side of the border and then drives them back to New York.Right away I had a hard time buying that the gambler husband would simply abandon his family. Okay, there are gambling addicts who do crazy things but it is established that he has a good relationship with his sons and wouldn't he at least be keeping in touch? Then there's Ray who doesn't seem to have any relationships outside of her interactions with her children. And when she does interact with her teenage son, they are always having very unpleasant, grating conversations throughout the film. Despite being a good mother and presumably someone who's never had interactions with criminals before (she tells Lila that she's never done anything criminal like smuggling before), it just so happens that she packs a gun and pulls it out right away the first time the two go on their smuggling run! Not believable. Also New York Police not being allowed to investigate a felony on tribal land doesn't sound right. And then there's the whole problem of why the Elders allowed Lila to take the baby away from the paternal grandmother who they awarded custody to after blaming Lila for having a hand in the death of her husband as well as her overall bad behavior.The midpoint of a film is usually where the protagonist commits herself to her objective fully. The midpoint in Frozen River is when Ray and Lila pick up a Pakistani couple and are about to drive them back to New York. Unbelievably Ray has never heard of ""Pakistan"" but she's aware of the phenomena of suicide bombers. She takes a package that the woman is holding and puts it in the backseat. While driving at night over the river, it occurs to her that there might be something dangerous in the package (such as a bomb) and without really inspecting the package, throws it out of the car onto the frozen river. When she delivers the couple to a motel owner smuggler back in NY State, the two women discover that there was a baby in the package. So they retrace their route in the car, and Lila (who has trouble with her eyesight) somehow recalls the spot where they threw the package, recover the baby and return it to the grieving couple. The baby, who seemingly was dead since it was out in the cold, comes back to life after Lila warms the infant up in the car. Why a mother (even a scared illegal alien) would ever allow a stranger to take a baby away from her did not seem credible in the least nor did Ray's failure to really inspect the package.The second act ""crisis"" involves Ray and Lila's last smuggling run where they transport two Chinese girls over the river. Before they put the girls in the trunk, Ray pulls out her gun once again and ends up in a shootout with a smuggler. Of course she's only wounded superficially in the ear. The car gets stuck in the slightly thawing ice and Ray, Lila and the two girls flee to the Mohawk reservation. At first, Ray wants Lila to take the rap and give herself up to the police. In a reversal, she sacrifices herself by surrendering to the police. With a sentimental flourish, she's told that she's only facing 4 months in jail for smuggling. Meanwhile, Lila 'takes back' her child from her dead husband's mother and for some reason, the tribal elders (who had ruled against her earlier) say nothing when she removes the child from the reservation. Lila (at the behest of Ray) arrives at the trailer and will take care of Ray's kids for the four months she's locked up. Oh by the way, Lila's eyesight is restored when she gets a pair of eyeglasses. And what about when Ray's teenage son almost burns down the trailer while using a blow torch to deice frozen water pipes? While it appears that a small section of the trailer is damaged from the small fire set by the teenager, the trailer itself does not appear to be structurally damaged. But Ray proclaims that the trailer is 'ruined' and that's why she's now desperate to make one last run to obtain the cash to make the down payment on the new trailer.All the principals here must must have 'hearts of gold', including the teenage son--he's guilty of committing credit card fraud by victimizing elderly people on the Mohawk reservation and finds some measure of redemption after being forced by the tribal elders to apologize to one of his elderly victims. While Lila has a grudge against the 'white man' and rationalizes her smuggling as payback for mistreatment of her people, she's really not a bad person at all. And similarly, Ray, who knows what she's doing is wrong, is also not a bad person (she only gets the four months of 'hard time'). All's well that end's well when the new trailer arrives just in time for the New Year (presumably purchased with ill-gotten gains). Frozen River would have been much more of an interesting film if the screenwriter decided not to endow her characters with those one-dimensional hearts of gold and serve up such an unbelievable story with a predictable and sentimental ending."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,rkeinc,0,animation,2008,10,"When the first review I read was so negative, I had to write this review. Sometimes I think reviewers just go on an on to hear themselves as being authorities on anything to do with Star Wars. This animated rendition was excellent, fast paced, fun, well written and I thought I would see an IMDb review of around 8 out of 10. When I saw 5.2 I was shocked and started to read the reviews. Upsetting to say the least so this is to offset those terrible, negative and nonobjective comments. To say it was only for kids and not for anyone else is bogus. It's for the entire family and avid Star Wars lovers will enjoy this as much as anyone. Maybe the younger generation just doesn't like change and can only accept big box office names and special effects. This had really fun vehicles, storyline and I wasn't disappointed in any way. I was just disappointed in the shallow reviews of the horrible bad reviews. Get a life and step out of yourselves. This was fun and will keep you captivated the whole way! Enjoy!"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,tubby1,1,drama,2010,3,"The Secret Life of Bees unlike the meticulous insect this film is named after is void of coherency and organisation. The book is thoughtful but the film just seems to block-out this need and produce a turgid, slow and queer tale.The story does not structurally hold form and their is no weightiness to the narrative. The Secret Life of Bees tirelessly regurgitates the usual devices to promote its themes, which are mostly weak and brittle. There comes a point in most films where you grasp what the film is about, and you can follow the story with a sense of purpose. The Life of Bees just doesn't provide that purpose it glides rather sub-consciously through a story.Queen Latifah is the only actress to bring character and a strong presence to the film. All the characters are one-dimensional, and you cannot be charmed by such artificiality. The film has a heart but it is firmly superficial and saccharine. The score is decidedly messy, it appears to just 'break-in' on the film, and create an abrupt interruption.The Secret Life of Bees struggles and struggles. The whole of the film fails to provide a firm platform of coherency and is a poor eccentric sort of fairytale. The film is confused and beats without purpose leaving an ugly sting in its tail"
Lakeview Terrace             ,Jacques98,0,crime,2008,6,"We've all heard the ""racism is evil!"" thing preached, preached again, and then preached again. We get it: racism is bad. I'm not racist. I don't know anyone who is racist. Why does every single movie have to remind us of something we teach our children before they're old enough to talk? After I watched Hairspray and Be Kind Rewind in the past year alone, I officially had enough. And not only me. At the time, my best friend, who was born and raised in Africa then moved to the US, said the same thing: why can't movies just stop beating a pointless, dead, blood horse? If someone is racist, I doubt a movie is going to change their mind. Then, out of nowhere, Lakeview Terrace comes along and defies every cliché you thought you knew about racism movies. And that is really all I have to say about the topic: thank God that someone, anyone, in Hollywood gets that we're sick of being force-fed clichés. Why is Lakeview Terrace cliché-defying? It focuses on the gray aria of racism, not black-and-white. It focuses on racism held by blacks, not by whites. It veers so far from the ""racism is evil!"" standpoint, and makes you make up your own mind about the over-the-top plot and who was right, who was wrong. It's been so long since Hollywood actually let the audience make up their own mind, this is like a breath of fresh air.Lakeview Terrace is labeled as a thriller, which is half true. The first half builds up the social boundaries of real life, testing them, and then building them up stronger. It doesn't jump straight to action, but soaks you in reality before plunging into the over-the-top ending. When the action starts, near the ending, it is really worth the weight because it has you in a state of social tension. Anyone who says this isn't realistic doesn't understand realistic human behavior. Even in the most outrageous parts of the film, there was not a single thing done by anyone that was hard for me to believe could happen in real life. Maybe that's because I have a lot of cops in my family, or maybe it's because I'm just more tuned into reality than the optimistic-happy-""Humans are perfect!"" people that are reviewing this film and calling it unrealistic.The directing, writing, and technical details are all fine. They're not artistic or ""find cinema"", but they're done in a way that makes the film work. The acting from Samuel L. Jackson is flawless. The casting from certain other characters is a little off, but it works out in the end.Overall, I liked Lakeview Terrace a lot. I'm the kind of person who loves thrillers, but as I said, this really isn't a thriller as much as a drama with a thriller-like ending and some thriller-like scenes scattered throughout. It's a nice break from the unintelligent mess that has become an anti-racism subgenre, and a nice break from the intense hardcore horror and action movies I enjoy watching. With that said, it didn't bore me, which really surprised me. Lakeview Terrace isn't perfect, it's not a work of art, but it's intelligent. I found it very much worth watching.6/10 "
The House Bunny             ,thbyrd,1,comedy,2008,1,"Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I don't' say that often! I kept waiting for the funny parts. And to think I drug my husband to it! Stupid premise, very predictable, quite awkward, embarrassing movie. One positive note.... Catherine McPhee was charming and great in her role. She definitely has a future in acting. Her role was small but credible and showed promise. Rumer Willis should keep her day job, whatever that might be. I felt sorry for Anna Faris. She looked good in the movie but the content was an embarrassment. Drippy, sappy, stupid. And what was Beverly D'Angelo thinking associating herself with this mess? And Hugh Hefner and the girls next door? Don't waste your time or money on this drivel."
Adoration             ,allison_lewis-1,0,drama,2008,8,"I also just saw this film at TIFF and wanted to say that I thought the writing, story, editing, sound, acting and directing were lovely. I read a so-so review after I had picked the movie to see so wasn't expecting to be so impressed but in only a few minutes I was totally immersed. Sadly, there were some questions during the Q+A after the screening that meant that a few people were confused by the dream/memory/reality scenes but I think (hope) they were in the minority. What a great surprise of a film. Even with a horrible seat in the 3rd row it was one of my favorite movies of the year. Scott Speedman gives a great supporting performanc"

The year is 2012 and the USA has collapsed and the Prison Death Races are the biggest thing on TV.I was sure I wasn't going to last long with this as it looked like it was going to be another video game movie and was all set to change over to Judge Judy. I was wrong. This is a good story, with good acting, dialogue, and cinematography. However, the real winners are the actual stunts performed on the race track. No CGI. Hard to believe, but no CGI that I could tell and at the end of the movie there is a statement that professional drivers did everything under controlled conditions. And, all I can say is WOW! OK, maybe there was a little CGI in here<U+0085><U+0085>.or not.Now, you have to understand, this is a race where there are few rules.

The Strangers             ,Freebird314,,horror,2008,1,"What are people talking about? Scariest film ever made? I seen EVERYTHING coming. You must have never seen any of the Friday the 13ths. They basically had the same plot just instead of Jason, you have strangers. I actually think the Friday the 13ths took more thought and had better scenes than this film did. I mean, the whole movie was about putting this couple through hell until the buildup and then there should have been a better ending. But no, all this buildup just to show them tied up and stabbed. It didn't even show that. What was the writer of this crap thinking? This film could have become another Texas Chainsaw Massacre if it had a better story behind it. But instead, it's a piece of crap."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,joewg3,0,animation,2008,3,"I expected a bit more out of this movie than was delivered. My 7 year old actually fell asleep near the end of the movie. No kidding. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head in describing the animation as video game quaility (maybe like 1990's quality). The story is a great storybook but terrible in movie format. I kept waiting for a funny part to come or something exciting to happen. It rarely did.I have to disagree with another reviewer who praised the voices. Honestly, I can't see the importance of having big named screen actors doing the voices of these characters other than trying to draw folks into a mediocre movie, unlike Madagascar where the voices and big named people actually make the movie even better."
Four Christmases             ,c_p_c,1,comedy,2008,2,"It's been a while since Hollywood gave us a genuinely good Christmas movie worth seeing. If you notice, the Christmas TV line-up is the same each year and the most modern film usually on the list is THE SANTA CLAUSE (1993). This just goes to show that, sadly, Hollywood isn't creating Christmas classics as it once did. Perhaps one of these years we will get a Christmas film reminiscent of the ones we love to watch on TV every year, but this ain't that year - or at least FOUR CHRISTMASES isn't that film.The problem doesn't lie within the film's premise, but in the actual events that play out in the film. Kate and Brad live life with and for each other and that's it. They don't have much contact with their families - where each parent is divorced and some remarried - and each Christmas opt for a tropical vacation, telling their families they are doing charity work instead. All in all, they are happy with each other, but have buried their family issues. However, this year they get caught in their lie and are forced to visit each parent individually, celebrating a total of four Christmases. In the hands of an able and creative script writer this film could have been quite enjoyable as both Kate and Brad learn to appreciate their families and not exclude certain things - mainly marriage and children - in their lives just because their parents are bad examples of them. Instead, each visit with a parent seems to be a drawn out slapstick or sex joke and nothing else and is just not in any way funny or clever.The film suffers from a lack of intelligence and it is shocking that it attracted the star power it did. The star's talents are hardly used and instead the film opts for over-sexed relatives, ultra violent brothers and insanely disobedient children - who get no reprimanding for their actions. As a genre of film that almost lends itself to families this one missed the mark and is not recommended for the kids. As an adult-geared Christmas film it just isn't funny. Adult humor can be funny and appropriate if there is other substance backing up the film - see 'KNOCKED UP' or 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.' All we are offered in FOUR CHRISTMASES is one boring and uninspired vignette after the next with paper-thin character development and uninteresting characters.With rarely an enjoyable moment and an atmosphere that provides almost no Christmas spirit, FOUR CHRISTMASES shouldn't be on anyone's list of holiday films. It is the awkward gift given by a relative. You know the type. It comes in a pretty package, but upon opening you find that it is a pair of underwear or a sweater that is designed to sit at the back of closets. This film surely will. "
Surveillance             ,ferbs54,1,crime,2010,7,"As if to demonstrate the old adage that ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree,"" director Jennifer Lynch gave the world in her belated sophomore effort, 2008's ""Surveillance,"" a film just as disturbing as any in her father David's oeuvre. Her follow-up to 1993's ""Boxing Helena,"" the film follows two very atypical FBI agents, portrayed by Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond, who are investigating a string of homicides in the plains of Nowheresville. (The picture was shot in the grasslands outside of Regina, Saskatchewan.) The pair interviews three salient witnesses: a young female coke addict (Pell James, who is excellent here), a local cop and an 8-year-old girl (Lynch elicits a wonderfully mature performance from young Ryan Simpkins). By the film's end, the conflicting accounts yield a somewhat clearer picture, before a twist ending really pulls the rug out from under the viewer. Indeed, this ending--a remarkably downbeat, merciless and outrageous shocker--should stun and flabbergast most of the film's audience. A repeat viewing of ""Surveillance"" demonstrates how very fairly the writers and Lynch have played their game, and will give an added appreciation for certain actors in the cast. ""I promise you, it's not like the other films you'll see,"" Ms. Lynch tells us in one of the DVD's copious extras, and darn if she isn't right! I cannot offhand think of another picture so deliberately amoral, and so blithely ruthless in the treatment of its entire roster of characters. While some might walk away from ""Surveillance"" clucking ""sick, sick, sick,"" most, I feel, will applaud its bravura daring, technical brilliance, fine acting and shocking windup. It's certainly not a movie to watch with the kids or with Aunt Petunia, but for those game for something different, it should just prove the ticket...."
What Happens in Vegas             ,Enchorde,1,comedy,2010,7,"Recap: Both Joy and Jack has seen better days. Joy just got dumped by her fiancée, in front of all their friends, and Jack just got fired, by his father. They both go to Vegas to forget their miseries and after a drunken night out end up married, by mistake. But a 3 million dollar lottery prize complicates matter. But instead of giving them an annulment the judge orders them to stay married for six months, in order to get a part of the money. Now a bitter feud start where they try to sabotage for each other in order to get all the money for themselves.Comments: A Hollywood blockbuster that actually works pretty well. It is funny, quirky and even if the main concept are unoriginal it has its own little fresh twists and turns. It got some really good jokes, and manages to hold a high level throughout the entire movie. It isn't just some small and few jokes that are funny, it is actually constantly funny. The best part however, is actually just after the story really ended, when they show what really happened in Vegas. Stay put and don't miss it, it got some good scenes after the credits too.Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz might seem like an odd match, but they work really well together. They really work as a pair, but don't forget that they both are solid comedians, veterans in these types of movies. And they certainly don't disappoint. But the supporting cast should get their credit too. The movies wouldn't be the same, not nearly as good without their partners in crime, played by Lake Bell and Rob Corddry.I guess that this is something that almost everyone can enjoy, a perfect movie when there are different tastes. I suspect that most people out there will find this funny, because it is very well made, even though it is not an epic classic.7/"
Street Kings             ,user-26785,,misc,2008,3,"Street Kings was a complete failure as a film mainly as a result of a almost incoherent story line and cringe-worthy dialogue.Without spoiling the film, all I can really say is that Street Kings is filled with character actions that leave the viewer scratching his or her head. It fails to link actions to character, or explain relationships between characters.It does have some brutal action scenes, which added some liveliness, but much of the movie was various characters vaguely explaining what has happened, leaving the viewer bored as hell.However, boredom is alleviated by the non-stop barrage of corny dialogue and lame clichés.The ending just tops it off, as it makes no logical sense, nor emotional sense, and the final climax of the film was a real let down. If i hadn't seen this film for free, I would have been very upset."
The Women             ,davepitts,1,comedy,2008,1,"First, I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any context in this version. She mentions going after ""Buck,"" which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. This movie is so dull that I'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that I found unbelievable: > Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff: ""I can suck the nails out of a board!"" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an Oscar nom, right? > A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler!!!??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. She wasn't above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. In killing her off, they killed the movie. "

You see a decent biography, well organized and told quite professionally. On the other hand, I am not sure whether the point is very clear. The movie is not done to criticize Bush, not at all. There is some notion of criticism to Iraq war but Bush is shown to be tricked and misinformed in this particular incidence. So if you want to see a movie that is making fun of Bush and his period of presidency, this is certainly not the movie you are looking for.

But then came along the Americans (no offense, i'm one) which bases a movie nowadays on ""how much money can we inject into explosions, shattered glass,blowing up cars,... that we won't have to pay to get decent actors ?"". And voilà you get this turd of a remake. Get the Japanese version and stick to it, in it the actors at least look like teenagers, in the American version they all look over thirty.

Sex and the City             ,denro03-1,1,comedy,2008,1,"First of all. It's bad. Really bad.I have seen all of the series and this movie really has nothing from the TV-episodes except for the characters and their names. It's flat, embarrassing and very shallow. The story was pointless even for this genre and wouldn't have taken more than an hour to write. The unique feeling in the series was not even close to appear in the movie. I hope that I will be able to keep watching the series after this. The horrible music and all the product placement of various brands, with tedious and flat-minded scenes thrown in the mix made it almost impossible to sustain throughout the entire movie.

W.             ,webcrind,0,misc,2010,1,"I hesitated to leave a review at first, because it might make certain people curious to watch that show, which is not what I would like you to do. Oliver Stone doesn't deserve making any more money by you renting his movie. I am not an American and I also never was a fan of Bush, jr. or senior. But I rented that movie because of some of the misleading comments on IMDb, which shows how gullible I can be, I know. I lived for 30 years in Europe and now reside in Canada, and you can take my word for it when I state the fact that most people outside of the U.S. think the Americans as an arrogant and ignorant bunch of bible wielding Joe six-packs. And many of the comments on this forum only prove it. George W. is not a moron, that's just how he came across. He graduated from Yale and passed the exam to get into Harvard Business, so how stupid can he possibly be. But Mr. Stone portrays him as such, because he is riding the anti-Bush wave. He is cashing in on the fact, that many people have a low opinion about their former president and he is using Michael- Moore- tactics by aiming low. And be it as it may, my main criticism with this movie is: would Oliver also make a movie about Mr. Clinton and portray him as a lying, cheating, warmongering, cunning, unethical and greedy non-individual? Of course not, so where is the artistic integrity? Because Clinton belongs to a group of politicians Oliver Stone obviously relates to. And if this political colouring leaks through a movie, the director is bad. I don't care what Stone votes when the elections come, so why does he need to tell me. Mr. Stone should concentrate on making documentaries, but he is not of the caliber of a Werner Herzog; Hell, they are not even in the same league. Stone is like Moore, with maybe a tad more talent. But the talent is waning. And I follow up with an apology to anybody who feels offended by certain comments I made, I am not anti-American. To conclude my opinion about Oliver Stone: he is a very biased film maker that lacks the skill of a Tom Tykwer, Martin Scorcese, Coppola or even Sam Peckingpah. And when it comes to bias, I have similar issues with Lars von Trier, who started out as a promising talent and now only demonstrates what a racist he really is. And ""emotions"" like that are better kept in and not transmitted onto the screen. Whatever happened with the director that made a movie like U-Turn?"
The Secret Life of Bees             ,nottoman,1,drama,2008,10,"I don't go around throwing 10's around for movie ratings, but I extremely impressed by this movie. The emotional and visual scope offered by the story, the cinematography, and the acting, gave all viewers with eyes to see and ears to hear, a wonderful treat. I'm sure not everyone loves this particular type of movie, but if you haven't been desensitized by the CGI and special effects of many of today's movies, you'll appreciate the very core of this movie, which is the human struggle - especially the depiction of the search for identity, and the need to give and received compassion from those living on this big blue marble together with us. A reminder of the racism of a not too far distant time, and the timeless theme of love, death, friendship, and compassion, add the effective seasoning that helps us all relate in some very tangible way to this movie. Enjoy it with someone you care about, and taste the honey."
The Dark Knight             ,jfmvp,0,action,2008,8,"** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why ""The Dark Knight"" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: ""But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible."" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as ""The Dark Knight"" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere ""superhero movie,"" or ""action movie."" Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in ""The Prestige"" was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking."" Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such ""The Dark Knight"" succeeded in escaping the ""superhero movie"" label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes. 2"
Igor             ,john_the_revelator-1,0,animation,2008,8,"I went in to this movie with no real expectations. This was a nice surprise for a Saturday matinée. The humor is dark and quirky, something that one wouldn't expect kids to understand, unless you're talking about a very cynical 5 year old or a pre-goth 11 year old.This movie's message was substantial in that it demonstrated several themes, at least to me. The first is that stereotypes are something that should be thrown out of the window and that through getting to know someone who isn't like you can open your eyes. Second, people have different abilities - and some may be too shy or scared to really shine so it's difficult to know them. Third, we choose who we are and that we all have the propensity for malicious decisions, so we must make our decisions with conscientiousness and wisdom. Fourth, real loyalty and friendship overlook individual differences and can't be swayed.The animation was at a level one expects this day and age - excellent. Steve Buscemi's (Mr. Pink as he will always be known to me) role as the Rabbit kicked butt. Oh, and of course, schadenfreud (the act of taking pleasure in someone else's misery) deserves a mention. Never did I expect that to be worked into an animated movie.There was some intensity in the movie, and one of the main characters ""turns on"" the evil in the end, which can be frightening and perhaps confusing to small kids.It was good to watch on the big screen, and I'm looking forward to its release on DVD for at least rental, and a probable bu"
Frozen River             ,jjcremin-1,1,crime,2008,9,"I had just seen Karie Bible perform an excellent Super Panel for Holly Shorts at the Sunset 5 in Hollywood.I was going to go back and see some more shorts but as I walked back I passed FROZEN RIVER. This got a lot of attention and good word of mouth when I was in Sundance and knew there were native Americans in the cast. Being a fan of diversity, and have rarely seen people smuggling from Canada, Quebec to be more specific, to New York, United States, it got my curiosity. Writer-director Courtney Hunt gave not quite an anti-Christmas movie but it's not the kind of Christmas movie that makes one feel warm and fuzzy inside. In fact, the weather outside is downright hostile. Driving is extra dangerous and even the river that crosses into Mohawk country is frozen enough to drive on. Melissa Leo portrays a middle aged store clerk whose saddled with two sons. The husband, never seen, has left them for gambling debts. She's forced to work part time for an unsympathetic boss who's half her age. She is desperate as she's facing foreclosure and needs money fast.While looking for her no good husband. an overweight Mohawk woman played by Misty Upham steals Leo's car, actually the extra one the husband had left with the keys inside. Leo tracks Upham and threatens to shoot her if she doesn't return the keys. However, the car is stuck and once Leo finds out how Upham makes money by human smuggling she's in. Now the main thrust of the adventure is for these unlikely women to team up with Leo as the driver and Upham doing the setups. It is revealed early on that Upham is badly nearsighted and has a son of her own that she can't get to. Mark Boone Jr. plays Leo's older son and gets involved in some money making schemes on his own. Some of those schemes almost backfires on him but he does get the toy for his younger brother.I won't give much more of this away because I do recommend it. There is suspense, poignancy, the implied hostility that natives and whites have for each other without being preachy, and strong characterizations that occur when the script is well written. And actually, one does feel good at the end"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,divadrummer,1,misc,2008,7,"A quick glimpse at the Tudor family line on Wikipedia will yield hundreds of years of made-for-movie material, but none quite as compelling as the story of Anne Boleyn. Pair a classic story with airy language, beautiful sets and costumes, and some A-list names and you have Oscar magic in the making. Right? Well, not always. We've seen it before and we're not necessarily impressed with royalty anymore. The Other Boleyn Girl offers new perspectives and dramatic angles on the saga of wives that is Henry VIII's legacy, but nearly drowns in melodrama.And it's not entirely the movie's fault. Boleyn Girl follows the story of both Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) Boleyn and their relationship with the English court. King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) has trouble producing a male heir, so the Boleyn family offers their daughter Anne to bed. When Henry has a hunting accident due to Anne's carelessness, he is nursed and subsequently charmed by innocent Mary. But Mary is already married, so the King promotes her husband and sends the couple to court where he can meet with Mary whenever he pleases. Mary falls in love with Henry and becomes his mistress. Anne, the elder sister, is scorned by what she believes is her sister's ultimate betrayal, and plots revenge. The two continue on in these roles for some time, swapping places in bed with Henry and spurting out babies while their relatives egg them on. This isn't quite how things went down in reality, but the changes are minor and seem necessary to condense the timeline and create at least one sympathetic character.The Other Boleyn Girl fares best when it's exploring the relationship between Anne and Mary. This isn't the first story of sister rivalry, but the dynamic between Anne and Mary is extraordinarily well-played. Their previous roles and their public images make Portman and Johansson perfect fits. We believe Portman to be intelligent and coy, and Johansson to be naive and desired. More - we believe these roles might be easily reversed. As sisters, their relationship is deeply disturbing: they love each other, they hate each other, they're unable to escape the expectations placed upon them by their family. As an older sister (with an admittedly not-as-screwed-up relationship), I found this portrayal very realistic - rich with emotion and complex meaning.I wish I could say the rest of the movie was as artful. There's constant allusion and foreshadowing to the Boleyn demise through use of visual and editing metaphors. If some details were twisted, other details might have been cut out - too many tear-filled scenes means that this eventually feels like a soap opera. At one point in the movie, Anne is sent off to France and comes back wearing a very distracting ""B"" charm, which she sports until the end of the movie. When I finally finished inventing what else ""B"" might stand for (besides Boleyn, there are plenty of other fits), I wondered about Anne's character. She's now praised as being changed and thus back in play, but I don't see it - she was smart and ambitious before, and only gained a bit of wit during her trip to France - certainly not the drastic change everyone seemed to be making it out to be. There are some very poorly done scenes where supporting cast spell out the politics of the situation for you. This is a little condescending and probably unnecessary, if not repetitive. The costumes are beautiful, but the matching dresses become unbelievable and even plain in places. PETA must have a field day with this movie and its use of fur and meat. You won't get to see Scarlett Johansson naked in this movie, in case you were wondering - just lots of fuzzy sex montages, weirdly full of backlit hair and fur. Katherine of Aragon (Henry VIII's first wife) is given some of the most powerful lines in the movie, but they're delivered with such woodenness that my disappointment must be made known.The Other Boleyn Girl could be so much more. As a hyper-dramatic costume flick, it does stand out. There's more than meets your eye, and the costarring performances are not to be missed. There's a lot of material to cover in this story, but a simplified script would have helped keep this film farther away from melodrama. Especially with a true story as wild as this, there's not a lot that needs to be changed or added to grip the viewer. Any embellishments verge on destroying believability and creating situations we can't relate to. 1"
The Burning Plain             ,gradyharp,1,misc,2009,10,"BURNING PLAIN is far more than a successful movie, it is an art work on celluloid that holds the viewer's attention and plays with the mind and emotions in a way that few other films have succeeded. Guillermo Arriaga has written another intelligent, cleverly paced walk through a maze that ultimately leads to finding all of the handsomely carved pieces of a puzzle that fit together so well it defies improvement. Known for other brilliant scripts ('Amores Perros', '21 Grams', 'Babel') this script he elects to direct with a cast of actors providing extraordinary performances. If this film doesn't win in every category of the Oscars this year..... The film has been given the tagline 'Love heals. Love absolves. Love burns.' The story, told in fragments of times past and times present, explores the lives of four women whose relationships are part of the secret the film reveals: Kim Bassinger is Gina, a married woman with children, including a perceptive and damaged daughter Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence), who has survived the mutilation of breast cancer and finds desperately needed love in the arms of Nick (Joaquim de Almeida), a clandestine love affair that takes place in a deserted trailer house in the outskirts of Las Cruces, NM. Charlize Theron (Sylvia) is the manager of a classy restaurant in Oregon who soothes past bruises with numerous superficial liaisons, one being with her chef (John Corbett). Maria (Tessa la) is a young girl living in Mexico with her father Santiago (Danny Pino) and his co-worker and friend Carlos (José María Yazpik). Each of these four women - Gina, Sylvia, Mariana, and Maria - is complexly tied to the others. The match that ignites the story is a fire that ends the lives of Gina and Nick, and after this tragedy the children of the two lovers - Mariana and young Santiago (J.D. Pardo) - bond and provide further fodder for the development of the ending of the story. To say more would destroy the tense, beautifully hewn script's conclusion. All is not as it seems until Arriaga pastes the pieces of the conundrum together. The cast is first rate, with Bassinger and Theron offering some of their finest work to date. The cinematography (Robert Elswit, John Toll), the music score (Omar Rodriguez-Lopez), the careful editing (Craig Wood) and the casting (Debra Zane) all are first class. Once again Guillermo has proved his gifts as an artist - both as a writer and now as a director. One of the finest films of the year. Grady Har"
Mamma Mia!             ,bandgeek81188,1,comedy,2008,1,"After sitting through this film, I have decided that it is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I knew it the moment I was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (OMG!) meet again, and then watching the same thing, only done by women old enough to be my mom. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments...1. Middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. Nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement, for that matter.3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy nilly, into the incredibly contrived and STUPID plot.4. My three year old nephew could have written a better script.I was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. And I normally really like movie musicals. Of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie...I am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career. I regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap. 1"
The Strangers             ,Bobbyh-2,,horror,2008,1,"Let me start by saying that I like scary movies...but to be effectively scary, a movie has to follow some coherent internal logic. This one doesn't. Characters in a good scary movie ought to behave--at least initially--as though their brains were functioning. These characters don't. There's nothing wrong with gore and brutality--assuming they're used for some reason. No rhyme or reason here. A group of masked kids terrorize a young couple who, as the film unwinds, behave inexplicably--leaving each other alone at moments where it makes no sense to do so, failing to make use of potential weapons at their disposal until it is, conveniently, too late for the weapons to do any good. Why does all this happen? Who knows? Who cares? Fairness compels me to point out that most of the audience--almost exclusively between the ages of 13 and 15 (which should have tipped us off) spend the entire length of the movie screaming constantly, which, I imagine, was why they'd come. To suggest that this film deserves remotely to be compared with films like ""Psycho,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" or ""Alien""...well, I'm at a loss for words that aren't too tasteless for this forum. What a criminal waste of celluloid."
"Surfer, Dude             ",Gulfer13,0,comedy,2009,1,"As a core surfer for the past 10 years, a Surf Film-maker and professional photographer, this movie is a disgrace to real surfers around the world. Of all the strides the image of surfing has made, this movie sets us all back. There are many professional surfers that are articulate and professional, unlike Mcconaughey's character smoking dope and talking like Spicoli. Mcconaughey's acting skills are beyond this role. I personally know surfers who are lawyers, doctors, business owners, firefighters, and many other professional occupations, yet this movie portrays surfers as a bunch of loser stoners. There is no plot to speak of in Surfer Dude and the character development is weak. To top it off, the movie has a flat spell for over 2 months in California. The Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle doesn't even have a flat spell that long, much less the Pacific ocean with all the groundswells that traverse it. With the lack of surf in the screenplay we also suffer the opportunity to even see ""actor face imposed"" surfing footage in the film. Even Blue Crush was more accurate and respectful to the sport of Surfing than this movie."
Gomorrah             ,bob the moo,,crime,2008,NA,"Some publications gave Gomorra a perfect rating, while others gave more basic reviews but, in a week where The Times reviewed about 10 new releases and gave this 5 stars and everything else 1 or 2, I decided this was a film I should check out and that The House Bunny could perhaps wait for another time (specifically, when it is the last film on Earth). Gomorra opens with a beauty salon hit which I imagine is meant to introduce us to the violent and treacherous world of the Cammora crime syndicate in the locality of Naples, Italy. As an impacting opening, it does work but the ""introduction"" idea is sadly where the film is roundly weak and it does mean that it has the potential to confuse.Before I get a barrage of messages pointing out to me that cousins shouldn't marry, I do not mean that I could not follow the specific threads of the film but just that the film offers nothing to inform the new viewer of the world that we are about to enter. I'm not sure the best of doing this but certainly at first I didn't totally appreciate the scale of the organisation, the structure or the setting and it took me a minute as a result to get into the stories. Unlike similar films, the separate threads never really come together in any way other than they share a grounding in location and the problem of the Cammora. Outside of a specific introduction for those coming in cold, the film does give a sort of introduction to the problem as we first follow one of the characters around the nightmarish, enclosed estate of flats which seems to perform the task of judge and prison-officer as those born into it have little opportunity to escape it and essentially have their fate sealed by virtue of their environment. Within this feat of architecture we follow several threads including a money-man, a boy getting into the life on the lowest rung, a man starting out in the corrupt world of waste management, a black-market tailor looking to earn a bit more on the side and two young men who decide to seize power in their region from the old, fat men who sit at the top. In terms of engagement, there isn't really a huge emotional draw within the film but instead it all feels very realistic and dead - so it is not so much that you feel for the specific characters so much as you have a constant sense of hopelessness and of how small and petty it all it. This is not the Italian gangsterisms of The Godfather where there is a certain sense of class and aspiration, in Gomorra the top men are trapped in the world the same as everyone else - with more money perhaps but they are not living in mansions or controlling things from a tropical island. The delivery of the film helps this as it is well shot on location and has a hand-held feel of grit and dirt. I didn't really like the technique employed throughout where the focus was on the subject in the close foreground and everything else was blurred, even as it came into play in the scene but otherwise it was well done, with the sudden moments of violence made more impacting by not being seen due to confusion simulated in the camera or by quick editing.Gomorra has been compared to City of God, Goodfellas and all the other crime films that get wheeled out for reviews. In most ways this is not really a fair description because Gomorra does not have the style and flair of those films, nor do all the narrative threads come together neatly in the way we have come to expect. However it is still an engagingly bleak and realistic look into the world of the Cammora that is well done even if it has flaws. It is not ""enjoyable"" per se due to the lack of flair, but it is a very good film nonetheless and, like City of God did with City of Men, it offers the potential for a mini-series to further explore and find stories from within this world."
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,gazebo,1,misc,2008,7,"I went to watch this movie knowing that even though the historical figures are real, the story is basically fiction, only Philippa Gregory's version of the tragedy of Anne Boleyn. Watching this film with this attitude really helped me enjoy it rather than be upset that all the historic characters' personalities were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable. I suggest anyone else going to see this movie adopt this attitude too.Sitting back, I proceeded to enjoy the scenery, the costumes, the beautiful actresses portraying the Boleyn girls and the over the top acting.It was a fun movie and it moved along quickly. Scarlet Johansson and Natalie Portman were excellent as the Boleyn sisters. Eric Bana played a very conflicted Henry VIII who is continually frustrated by not getting a male heir. Eric Bana was not very good in this movie, I'm not sure what it was, maybe it was the way how the character was written or that he was just not comfortable in the role. He was extremely miscast as King Henry.The one to watch in this film is Natalie Portman who seems to have a grand time playing the evil, scheming Anne Boleyn.I am pleased to see that all the women in this film, like Lady Boleyn, Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn and Queen Catherine of Aragon were portrayed as having strong characters and not easily pushed around. Even Mary Boleyn, who seemingly always acquiesce to the wishes of her father and uncle, decided in the end to run off and marry someone who truly loves her.It's a very entertaining film. Just remember that it's only someone's version of the Tudor history, not the real history, and you won't run into trouble!"
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,Quinoa1984,0,misc,2010,6,"I'm sure if I were raised in Italy and paid attention to Italian politics day in and day out all of what transpires in Il Divo would be no less than engrossing. The story of Androetti, the head of a government that went for seven administrations and then went on to run for President has some really fascinating things to it. One of those is seeing just how the parliament works in those scenes midway through the picture and how the country actually chooses its president, which is so far removed from the US democratic process it's hard to fathom. And I also admired how the actor playing Androetti so got into this kind of quietly conniving politician, a man who believed that politics was everything and yet would never get passionate enough to raise his voice above a whisper. Somewhere inside of him a Dick Cheney is rumbling, perhaps.But the problem in watching the film if you don't pay attention to the Italian politics of the period, or just in general, is that the filmmakers lose you fairly quickly. I usually find myself a viewer who doesn't like to be spoon-fed information very simply, but this is on the opposite end of the cannon where only a few real details are clear enough and then the rest comes whizzing by at a quick clip (and quick indeed as the camera style is akin to the operatic nature of Scorsese, only not as talented or focused). Names of characters keep coming up as title cards, and except for a couple of names like ""The Lemon"" (Androetti's right-hand man), none of them really stick out, and the incidents keep piling up without any real connection. At some point the basic story does reveal itself and holds some interest, but there's a disconnect between many scenes too, and a sense of cross-cutting done a few times (i.e. the horse race scene crossed with a shooting) comes off as unimaginative.It's not a waste of time though if you're totally ignorant about Italy's political structure and brash sense of the power dynamic. But it's not one that I particularly enjoyed, either, and its lack of a connection with the mounting details made it harder to appreciate"
The Bank Job             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,crime,2008,9,"I was watching Ebert and Roper the other day on TV and they were discussing 2008's movies and how over all they have been disappointed, I think we all have. But they did discuss the top movies to see and The Bank Job was in their top three, I finally found a theater that was still playing the movie, I saw it today and I have to say that I really loved this heist movie. It's definitely one of the better heist movies in a very long time because it brings something different to the table, this isn't a movie about the heist, it's the aftermath of the heist. We are always usually left wondering if the robbers got away with the heist afterwords in movies. Now this movie is based on a true story, it's based in the 1970's(bonus it doesn't remind you every 10 minutes) and it's about just amateur robbers that pulled off one of the largest heists in England's history with finding corrupt cops and ending badly.Martine Love approaches Terry Leather, an amateur thief and long time friend. She offers information to get into one of the biggest heists they could hit, the ability to break into a vault. Terry and his group successfully break into the vault and takes four million pounds, including jewelery, cash, bonds, and some extremely private and damaging photos of the mobsters and government of England. When the group just about gets away with it, things go terribly wrong when one of the members are captured and they found out there was an alterer motive to this heist.The Bank Job has great acting, terrific editing, and is just a great thriller that truly keeps your attention. Jason Statham, this guy has never really stood out to me as someone who could be a good actor, most of his movies could never display what he could do, but The Bank Job is without a doubt his finest role to date that I'm aware of, he pulls the part off well and makes the story more real. The Bank Job has great drama and action, it's a great movie that I'm really glad I saw, a big recommendation if you're looking for a good movie to watch.9/10 "
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,Chris Knipp,0,misc,2009,8,"Il Divo, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year and has recently been released in US movie houses, is a devastatingly ironic and highly stylized portrait of the strange, extraordinarily powerful and long-lived Italian politician Giulio Andreotti. He has been in Italian government in some office or other since the late 1940's. After slipping out of repeated convictions for Mafia ties in the past decade he remains ""senator for life"" at the age of 90, and he's been credited with helping bring down governments even quite recently.The ultimate political survivor, Andreotti was seven times prime minister from 1972 to 1992. He's had a seat in the Italian parliament without interruption since 1946, and has also been Defense Minister, Foreign Minister, and President. In Andreotti's own view (though he walked out on the film) his wife of 60 years Livia (Anna Bonaiuto) and his long-serving secretary Vincenza Enea (Piera Degli Esposti), are both sympathetically portrayed in Il Divo. He really didn't like being shown kissing Mafia boss Toto Riina, which he has said never happened. In the film, Andreotti is most haunted by the Red Brigades' murder of the kidnapped of Aldo Moro, which he might have prevented.Though Sorrentino's film is in some ways a detailed chronicle of Anreotti's 60-plus years of political power and dubious dealings, with a focus on the seventh government and its aftermath, the film seems more an exercise in style than an impassioned study of politics. The self-consciousness of its frequent uses of loud contrasting music, ceremonial, almost Kabuuki-like set pieces, and slow-motion to muffle scenes of violence are further underlined by the performance of Toni Servillo, who accurately, perhaps too accuately, mimics Andreotti's look, his hunched posture, even his oddly turned-down ears, and his puppet-like mannerisms. Staring forward, neck rigid, he keeps his arms close to his body and his hands turned inward and peers expressionlessly out of his big eyeglasses. He walks across the floor in quick tiny steps like some 18th-century Japanese court lady. There is no attempt by director or principal actor to charm or to involve. It seems Sorrentino, with Servillo's diligent collaboration, is laughing not only at Andreotti and at Italian politics, but at us.Il Divo is soulless and cynical, but it is so stylish that it's bound to be remembered. It's some kind of ultimate statement of the essence of the slick, heavily-guarded world of Italian political corruption. In its own special, magisterially mean-spirited and pessimistic way it's an instant classic.In this film, Andreotti, who has been referred to as ""Il divo Giulio"" (""The God Giulio,"" referencing the Roman Empire's deification of Julius Caesar), and by monikers like ""Beelzebub,"" ""The Fox,"" ""The Black Pope,"" ""The Prince of Darkness,"" and ""The Hunchback,"" is a queer, nerdy, mummified-looking creature who hardly ever changes expression or cracks a smile. His rigid gestures and the odd commentary of his group of primary supporters, themselves all provided with gangster-style nicknames, lead to a series of scenes that suggest politics as caricatural facade, as almost pure ritual, with time out on occasion for jokes, self-pity, and cruelty to others. You won't hear constituents mentioned in this movie, though when somebody says another politician prays to God but he prays to the priest, Andreotti answers: ""Priests vote. God doesn't."" Politics is everything to him, and politics means the pursuit of power.For a non-Italian the details of various moments from the Aldo Moro kidnapping and all the terrorism of the Brigate Rosse of the 1970's to the 1990 Mafia trials may be pretty confusing. It's not that the filmmakers don't care; they're primarily talking to an Italian audience. But even for such an audience, they're keeping an ironic distance.The facade never cracks. In one scene, typically staring straight forward, Andreotti delivers an impassioned speech of self-defense, raising his voice almost to a shout at the end, but without moving a muscle of his face. Servillo is a noted man of the theater in Italy and his whole performance is a chilly tour de force that inspires awe without giving much pleasure. Andreotti in this soliloquy--which highlights the film's often solipsistic feel--argues that a leader must manipulate evil in order to maintain good. This may fit in with the evidence that he collaborated with the Mafia, and yet at times was severe in repressing it.In life as in this film Andreotti has compensated for what may be the lack of visible humanity by being a wit, and Il Divo crams as many of the famous battute or one-lineers into scenes as it can. One was ""the trouble with the Pope is that he doesn't know the Vatican."" Another: ""They blame me for everything, except the Punic wars."" ""Signor Andreotti, how do you keep your conscience clean?"" he was once asked. ""I never use it,"" he replied. Other bons mots among many: ""The trouble with the Red Brigades is they're too serious,"" and ""Power is fatiguing only to those who don't have it."" The world of Italian politics is baffling to the outsider. Andreotti's cool detachment and wit and this film's stylized cynicism may be the best approach to its deviousness and complexity.Last year Servillo also played one of the main characters in Matteo Garrone's Gomorrah, where he's an out-and-out Mafia functionary. Gomorrah won Cannes' number-two award (just below the Golden Palm) the Grand Prize, last year, which given Il Divo's Jury Prize prompted declarations of a rebirth of Italian cinema in the making. Non-Italians like Mafia movies; Italians are sick of them, and might have wished for patriotic reasons that their best filmmakers had won applause by turning to some other subject matter. Both these films are cold, detached, and analytical. Maybe they mean Italians are getting serious about their own film industry and want to look the country's ugliest aspects right in the eye. But don't look for hope here. A great cinema requires more humanity than this."
Prom Night             ,BrianCTyler,1,horror,2008,1,"PROM NIGHT (2008)directed by: Nelson McCormickstarring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her. Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.An example:Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOLcons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker."
What Happens in Vegas             ,ConnorMonteith,1,comedy,2011,7,"""What happens in Vegas"" is about 2 people unexpectedly meeting up in Las Vegas, and after getting drunk, getting married. The next day, none of them can remember the night. Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) and Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) - the now pronounced married couple - turn up in court after Jack wins the jackpot $3,000,000. They are sentenced to 6 months hard marriage, and must attend regular counselling sessions. If they manage to live together for the whole time, the money is split. But if one of them asks to get out of the marriage, then the money is rewarded to the other person. So they each make the other persons life hell to force them out of the marriage.The film is a perfect mix of romance and humour. The film is pretty predictable to the viewer, but that doesn't make it bad. It's not a typical Hollywood flick. It may be basic with storyline and humour, but somehow it still appeals to many people.Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher both play fantastic roles as always. In the film, they both act about 10 years old, playing jokes on each other, and just having a good time. They play there characters incredibly well. In my opinion, Kutcher has played his most energized performance to date.""What happens in Vegas"" is an exceedingly bright comedy, and Diaz and Kutcher seem to work well together and have fun playing their roles with each other. The start of the film is basically like many other film set in Sin City, but it eventually settles into a rhythm.Tom Vaughan - the director - structures this film in a way that makes it enjoyable compared to some other similar RomCom's. I recommend watching if you have liked previous RomCom's. Something about this particular film makes is stand out from other classic movie'"
Frozen River             ,bgills-1,1,crime,2008,10,"I caught a viewing of this tonight at the fantastic Traverse City Film Festival. The film was really fantastic. It is an indie flick very reminiscent of David Gordon Green's work (George Washington, All the Real Girls, etc) in pacing, cinematography, and the depth of character the director is able to elicit with profound minimalism. The plot centers around a Mohawk coyote who smuggles illegals across the St. Lawrence in the winter by driving back and forth between the Canadian and US segments of the Mohawk Reservation. The Mohawk are one of the few tribes that issue their own passports and directly challenge federal authority to regulate their border. Because the reservation covers areas in both nations there isn't much either side can do. For the Mohawk, sovereignty has real meaning, and they protect it fiercely.The main character (aside from the Mohawk woman) is a white woman living in the area who's husband is a degenerate gambler and has taken off with the money she had saved to get them a new modular home. We never meet him, but nevertheless are given a good portrait of his and the family's struggles with his addiction. She needs $4k fast, stumbles into this smuggling business quite unexpectedly and decides its her only hope to avoid homelessness for herself and two kids. It's suspenseful, introspective, and the acting is top notch by everyone. I also loved how it provided a glimpse into one part of Indian Country few people even know exists, and treats the Indians as people rather than victims or otherwise attempts to cajole the audience into feeling something for them. They are just people. Just like us.Highly recommended. 1"
Shutter             ,tknudsen_houston1,0,horror,2008,8,"Cliché. Agreed. I knew pretty much what the ending would be about 20mins into it. But, there really is no such thing as an original movie anymore. Whatever it is it's been done. The only thing they can do now is get a better actor or more special effects. You don't go to a horror movie for a thought provoking story line, you go to get scared or grossed out, or to get REALLY close to your date. The movie accomplishes this, unless you are one of these people that walk through haunted houses and roll your eyes no matter what they throw at you. If you are then go get a job in Kosovo because that's about the only way you are going to get scared.I liked it and the ending was fitting. There's some good jumps and they manage to pull off ultra creepy without the jerky photography so commonly used in ghost stories now. One thing though: **spoiler**I also noticed a few comments as to why there was such a fuss about the pictures Jane finds in Ben's forgotten pictures. Ummm...lets see..he took pictures of the poor crazy girl while his two best friends raped her. There were more than 3 pictures. He didn't just mistreat her; he used her to make snuff pictures which is usually why you have vengeful female spirits. Again, cliché, but how many reasons are there to come back and terrify someone really"
Surveillance             ,neil-476,1,crime,2009,8,"I'm usually happy to spoiler away in reviews - this time I shall be very careful not to spoiler.I hadn't realised that the tendency to make disturbing movies is hereditary, but Jennifer Lynch's Surveillance is every bit as disturbing as anything Dad David has made. It starts with a moderately familiar scenario - two FBI agents arrive at a small police station (4 officers, one captain, one dispatcher) in the back of beyond to tape video interviews with the survivors of some sort of incident: the nature of what happened is revealed during the interviews. To say any more is to spoiler, so I'll shut up about the plot.But I will say that ""disturbing"" is the best word to describe almost all of what follows. And not just one lot of disturbing, but several. The film is gripping, visceral, and features some stunning performances, notably from Bill Pullman who is not someone who I would normally have put high on my list of those I expect to surprise me performance-wise.Not an easy film in many ways, but definitely worth catching. "
Nights in Rodanthe             ,driether,1,drama,2008,3,"I like all different types of movies, so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc.I just felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isn't realistic. This movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. You are neither right or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a major disappointment. "
Nim's Island             ,ryan_christopher,1,adventure,2008,9,"I have read many comments about predictability, blah, blah, blah! I found this film refreshingly entertaining for all ages. There was something for everyone. Being a female around the same age, I can relate to Jodie Foster since I practically grew up with her!! And I do feel it was great seeing her in a lighter movie than she's been making lately.Abigail Breslin was cute as always. She definitely can hold her own, but then she always has.Gerard Butler - well I can never say enough about him. That's why I put great movie in more ways than one. To see him in two roles was just great. My daughter who is 15 got me into him from ""Phantom"" to ""Dear Frankie"" to ""300"" (and I hate war movies usually) to ""Tomb Raider"" to ""P.S. I Love You"" and now this movie. We went with 4 of her friends, and after wards we had a discussion on which ""Gerard"" we liked better. The vote was four for the swash-buckling Alex Rover (myself included) to two for the more clean-cut Jack! We all agreed that we loved this movie."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars             ,keiichi73,0,animation,2008,1,"So, it has come to this. I think it's safe to say that The Clone Wars pretty much flattens any last shred of credibility that the Star Wars franchise may have held. The disappointing prequel trilogy gave us warning signs that all was not well in LucasLand. This disappointingly shallow, dull, and unneeded side story all but rams the point home.The solitary purpose of The Clone Wars is to introduce a new animated TV series that will be debuting on the Cartoon Network later this year. Now kids will be able to follow the further adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi (voice by James Arnold Taylor) and Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter), set chronologically between Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. But, hold on a minute. Did executive producer George Lucas or anyone else involved with the project realize just how pointless this idea is? We've seen the original trilogy, we've seen the prequel trilogy. We pretty much know what's going to happen to the characters, since their fates have pretty much been public knowledge for about 30 years now. It's a core problem in the movie as well. When Anakin faces down the evil Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) late in the film, the fight seems completely needless, since we hold advance knowledge that the characters do not.The story can best be described as a very basic and shallow hook to hang a seemingly endless string of interminable space dogfight battles, and lightsabre duels. Jabba the Hutt's infant son, Rotta, is kidnapped by mysterious assailants. The kidnappers are working under the devious Dooku, who plans to use the baby Hutt to frame the Jedi, leading Jabba to believe that they are responsible for the abduction. Obi-Wan and Anakin already have their hands full battling the evil droid army that is spreading out across the galaxy, and now they must track down the young creature before the Hutt clan declares war against the Jedi and the Republic. While Obi-Wan and the clone soldiers try to hold off the advancing armies, Anakin, along with his young Padawan apprentice Ahsoaka Tano (Ashley Eckstein), must try to return Rotta to his proper home. Call it Adventures in Hutt-Sitting.The Clone Wars literally starts with a bang, throwing us directly into the middle of a battle with little explanation, other than a hastily-spoken narration voice over that sounds like it was read by a game show announcer. From there, the characters are briefly re-introduced to us in the thick of battle. Once the situation with the missing baby Hutt is established, the movie literally never slows down. It's one exhausting fight scene or action sequence after another as Anakin and Ahsoaka race across the galaxy to reach the planet Tatooine, as they're pursued by various aliens, droids, and whatever else the filmmakers feel like throwing in. It doesn't take long for the movie to start to resemble a hyper-active video game, as it never slows down long enough to allow the characters to do anything but run and shoot at things. But then, given the wooden dialogue on display, maybe it's a good thing. While the actual Star Wars films were not exactly known for their dialogue, I have to admit I choked on my soda just a little when I heard Anakin's new Padawan refer to him affectionately as ""Sky-guy"".It's quite clear that the main appeal of the original films were the special effects, not to mention the imaginative worlds and creatures. So then why does The Clone Wars look no better than the stuff you see in a Saturday morning cartoon? I know, the movie is intended to be a launching point for one, but that doesn't explain how cheap everything looks here. The characters suffer from a very shiny and ""plastic"" look that makes them look more like animated action figures than actual people inhabiting the story. The hair on the characters don't even move. It's molded and painted onto their heads, kind of like a Ken doll. I'm also still trying to figure out the filmmakers' decision to give everyone such limited facial movement, making the entire cast look like they just received a massive Botox implant. I didn't believe for a second that I was watching a genuine story, or even a continuation of the Star Wars universe. I felt like I was listening to a bad fanfiction story written by a fanboy hopped up on way too much caffeine, acted out by poorly rendered video game characters.Unless you're the most forgiving fanatic of the franchise to walk this green Earth, or are under 10-years-old, there is absolutely nothing appealing to be found within The Clone Wars. It's nothing but a lot of noise and explosions that assault the senses for 100 minutes, then leaves you walking out of the theater with no real thoughts or impressions. It's not even enjoyable in one ear and out the other entertainment. I'm sure the TV series will probably be no different, but at least you won't have to pay to watch it. You can also change the channel, something I wished I could have done many times watching this film. 1"
The Ruins             ,capt0474,,adventure,2008,1,I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know a lot about it so I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it.The story did an OK job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to. The suspense continues when the Mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins.Then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless. The amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value.The fact that they didn't make any attempt to fight the vines from hell. They had fire and didn't try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and don't have half a brain to try to fight back. 
Australia             ,spencer-ingram,1,adventure,2008,1,"This might be the worst movie of 2008. Definitely the most over-blown of the past few years, and should win quite a few Razzies. I don't know how any studio exec could read this script and green-light it. And apparently Kidman and Jackman didn't read the script before signing on, either.I knew it was going to be melodramatic and unintentionally funny when the opening epigraph contains the line ""a time when romance and adventure were a way of life in Australia,"" and then the kid starts his inane narration. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was in a group.Some of my friends and I had a good time laughing at it, though, especially the gem of a scene near one of the four or five endings. In this scene, Jackman walks to Kidman on the dock just as the mist parts. She requests to journey home, to which he replies ""There's no place like it."" Classic. That drover is such a romantic renegade, cut from the same cloth as Clark Gable.And one more thing: Australia is hardly an appropriate title for this grand, cinematic achievement--it should be called ""Walkabout"" or ""He's Going on Walkabout."" The word ""walkabout"" seemed to occur about 10,000 times. If the director had cut out on that redundancy alone, he might have shaved off the extraneous hour and a half of the film."
Good Dick             ,GinaFromJerz,1,misc,2013,1,"Lately, I've seen a lot of articles about the ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"" phenomenon, as portrayed in many movies/TV shows, and anything Zooey Deschanel has ever starred in. The whole concept boils down to ""she's crazy/selfish/addicted/broke/a cheater/etc etc etc"", but SO DAMN CUTE (or HOT) that the main male character in said movie ignores all the obvious warning signs that she's not relationship material, and often turns their life upside down for her. Or, at the very least, ignores the normal, stable girl who is in love with him, in favor of the ""rush"" of being with the crazy girl. This movie seems to be telling the opposite story. The male protagonist is portrayed as being sympathetic, and a suitable partner for the female lead, despite the fact that he puts out all kinds of shady vibes almost immediately. He lies. He follows her, and peeps in her window. He repeatedly shows up uninvited, guilts her into letting him sleep on her couch, and brings her porn (Yes, she likes porn, but still...not really the first move of a Prince Charming). However, I've seen a lot of reviews suggesting that the relationship in this movie is ""good for her"" or ""healthy"" and I have to say, I disagree. I didn't like this movie, I'll just put it out there. It was slow-paced, and honestly after the initial peeping I thought it was going to go in a much different direction. As much as I've enjoyed the lead actor in other roles, his character here creeped me out intensely. I think this movie puts out the Manic Pixie Dream Girl vibe for women. I think if she had found out the way the relationship actually started, the average woman would be incredibly freaked out. I kept waiting for things to catch up with them, for her to find out, and she never did. Because of that, I just couldn't feel any support for their relationship. In truth, it gave me a nasty, almost rapey vibe. However, it seems to foster that ""the creepy guy who followed you home and peeped in your window MIGHT BE MR. RIGHT"" stereotype, the male equivalent of the MPDD vibe, and I just couldn't get past that. Knowing what we know as the viewer, and knowing she doesn't know, and he won't tell her, almost made me feel like an accomplice in his misleading of his potential girlfriend, and it just left me with a sad, shady feeling. The movie presents an unnaturally positive attitude towards overtly creepy, and socially unacceptable behavior, and I just can't co-sign that. I don't think anyone would want their best friend/sister/etc getting involved with a former addict, who has followed them, peeped in their window, and lied about it multiple times to continue to see her. In fact, if you remove the fact that she stupidly let him in, you have classic stalking behavior. Beyond this, I found this movie depressing, bleak, and long (even though it wasn't necessarily). It was one of those movies where I just kept checking the time, because it felt like it would never end. I'm no activist, but I wish writers would stop enforcing these silly stereotypes in ""romantic"" movies. No wonder boys and girls alike have a twisted idea of what love should be. This is why we can't have nice things, people. 1 out of 10 stars AKA that's another hour and half I'm never getting back. A disappointment. In fact, Mark Webber is the only thing that made this flick bearable."
The Dark Knight             ,straightblaster,0,action,2008,10,"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there. 3,518"
Four Christmases             ,firstalittlebackstory,1,comedy,2009,2,"Brad and Kate, an urbanite unmarried couple with no plans to tie the knot or ever have children, are forced to visit their respective families after bad weather grounds planes and keeps them from going on their yearly tropical Christmas vacation together. And so we the audience are treated to nonstop cruelty, violence, profanity, and humorless mockery of the Christmas tradition for the rest of the film.When Brad and Kate aren't being attacked, vomited on, and belittled, they're bickering about their increasingly deteriorating relationship, which is maybe not as solid as they thought. There is some funny dialogue, and the fish-out-of-water classism is amusing at times. But a few witticisms once in a while can't make up for the rest.Four Christmases had potential; as a concept, it makes sense. Nearly everyone can relate to dysfunctional family comedies, and with four families in the mix this movie could have been hilarious. Instead, it's relentlessly cruel. If the script had been tempered with any kind of warmth, love, or holiday spirit, perhaps it would have been a Christmas classic. Unfortunately, the writers saw fit only to mock Christmas and Christians both under the pretenses of making a Christmas movie.That the filmmakers loathe Christmas and everything it stands for is evident in every scene. That they expect their Christian, or Christmas-celebrating audiences to laugh along with their pathological hatred of the holiday and its higher meaning is absurd. The cast is indisputably talented but their skills are wasted on this charmless, unfunny bore. What a sham"
The Strangers             ,baumer,,horror,2008,1,"If you are a fan of horror films, then you have probably seen Scream. In it, Randy, the resident expert of the idiocy of horror movies, gives you the rules of horror films. In it he tells of all the things you should do in a horror film, but end up not doing anyway. I think this film is inspired by Randy's dialogue in Scream. This is the most clichéd horror film in the history of clichéd horror films. Comparing this to Halloween or the Shining makes me throw up in my mouth a little. It is just plain blasphemy. This is nothing like the greats from the 70's and the 80's. It's not even as good as CHUD, Friday the 13th or any other decent but flawed horror film.The problem with this film is that everything that these characters should not do, they do. Now, THERE ARE GOING TO BE PLENTY OF SPOILERS HERE SO IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING FURTHER BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY PLAN ON WATCHING THE FILM, THEN DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER.First, you are being hunted in the house, you have a shotgun that can blow a hole through an elephant, and you are in a room that has one way in and one way out. You are safe. All you have to do is wait it out or the both of you leave the house together with the safety of the shotgun. Or of course the alternative is to separate and one person stays behind without the shotgun, the other goes to a barn to find a two way radio. The last thing sane people do is separate. If I was being hunted in my cottage with my wife by my side, the last thing I would do is let her stay behind while I go find a radio. She would be by my side all the time.The best friend comes over at about 4 in the morning. He sees his buddies car bashed up. He sees the door with axe marks in it. He can see that something isn't quite right. Then has something smash his window. What should he do? Before entering the house, he should call the police and report suspicious behavior. But no, of course not, he enters the house with the loud playing music and doesn't call his friends name, or turn the music off, he of course walks silently into the open doorway and gets shot in the face by his best friend.The classic case of not believing your girlfriend when she tells you that someone has been in the house. ""No sweetie, you just imagined that you saw someone and you must of dropped your cell into the fire."" Sure that happens all the time.Every one of these characters deserved to die. They were stupid, unrealistic and completely clichéd in the worst possible way. And for the makers of the film to pretend this is based on true events is ever so manipulative. I read the supposed case this is based on and saying this is based on a true story is like saying Rambo is a love story. It's just plain wrong.The Strangers is one of the most incompetent films I have ever seen. There is no suspense, no thrills, no chills. There could of been, but you lose all feelings of remorse or sense of caring for the main characters because the screenplay betrays them so much.1/10 Truly, truly horrible film. 1"
Saw V             ,Boba_Fett1138,0,crime,2008,7,"Yes, the Saw-franchise is beginning to get a bit tiresome. I'm still a fan of it thought but it needs some new fresh ideas fast.Of course in essence all Saw movies are more or less the same. However all previous movies still knew to keep me interested and guessing throughout the entire movie. It still featured some surprising and interesting elements, while ""Saw V"" really doesn't feature any. No big surprises or twists here, not even at the ending, which in my opinion was a bit weak and disappointing. Normally the end of a Saw movie provides a big twists that will leave you shocked and stunned in your chair, for a few minutes after the movie has ended. I missed this in ""Saw V"".The movie is also the least interesting Saw movie as of yet because it features some lazy writing. Normally Saw scripts are airtight ones but not this one sadly. It often takes the obvious paths.Like always it is also featuring lots of different plot-lines and characters again, although in this case not all are connected well enough to each other. Seriously, what have all those people going to the Jigsaw-trails have to do with the rest of the movie its plot? It just seems to be there because its a Saw movie and it needs to feature all these sick and twisted games. The story lines don't ever really get together well enough. The movie again is also featuring lots of flashbacks, which shows events that happened in the previous movies, often seen from a different side this time but some of these flashbacks however are quite pointless for the movie once you start thinking about it.I also blame Hoffman for it that this movie doesn't work out as good and interesting as any of the other sequels. He's the new Jigsaw and as of yet he also is the least interesting one. It probably also has to do with the fact that he is featured a lot in the movie, while Jigsaw normally always remain on the background. Also the reasons why he became the new Jigsaw, as gets shown in this movie, are a bit shaky and not exactly believable.The movie itself is perhaps also lacking in one clear good main hero and character.It still is a superior genre movie of course. It's concept alone is already good and interesting enough to please the genre fans and provides the potential for an infinitive amount of Saw-sequels. All Saw movies have a great look and atmosphere over them, though this one works out as the least effective one when it comes down to its atmosphere and horror/thriller elements because of the reason that this movie features very little new elements.The Jigsaw games themselves also seem less innovative and clever. It's still gruesome and lots of bloods and guts can be seen flying around but it's just less surprising and shocking all.Lets hope ""Saw VI"" will have some fresh new good ideas and a better script with some better- and more interesting characters in it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Space Chimps             ,neftaliw,,animation,2008,5,"Wow!!!! I think this movie is funny, but not very funny. It looks like they had this huge story to run but they were short in time, everything went way to fast, there wasn't even time to laugh at a joke because in was one thing to the other, come on even things that usually take hours or days in this movie happens in half of minute (like building a rocket). Also some of the characters weren't well animated, they had very robotic movements and the aliens' skin looks so unreal (I know, they're unreal but they look like plastic!!!!) Also there where some major spoofs, for example they use geothermal energy from a volcano that doesn't have lava but a strange freezing liquid.

"Surfer, Dude             ",saurabhkgautam,0,comedy,2015,7,"I downloaded this movie recently as part of an attempt to chart Matthew McConaughey's movie career. The IMDb rating definitely made me think twice but since the title suggested harmless banter at worst, I switched it on in the background. Well, I was hooked within the first 15 mins. This movie not bad at all. In fact, I would highly recommend it to anyone who has 2 hours to kill. McConaughey's performance as Steve Addington, his character build up (3rd party stories around his background etc.), a great lineup of supporting actors and a plot that ends positively. The movie delivers on all counts that make up your average feel good Fri nighter. This one goes beyond in a lot of aspects. I'm rating this movie a 10 till the score recovers to 6."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,Cattus_99,0,action,2008,1,"I have always been a big fan of the Indy movies and I am a SciFi nut. I also read Ebert's reviews to understand his criticism and analysis. So that sets the stage.This movie is, unfortunately, dreck, ca-ca, poo, crud, call it what you will. It is an insult to the intelligence of each and every movie-goer. And for a Lucas-Spielberg movie to be so is quite beyond belief.Let me highlight the lows and then I will get into some specifics.The dialog seems little more than to act as a narration to explain what happened, what is currently happening and what will happen in the near future. It does not develop the characters or the plot.The plot is crude and unconvincing. The characters move through their lines with little humor and false emotion. Although I don't expect academy awards ranking here I do expect for than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" acting. (If you've seen this you know dreck.) The chase scenes are too long and not always relevant. There is no suspense, anxiety, or real fear displayed by the actors or felt by the audience. There were so many times in the movie that Indy should have been killed by the Russians since he had done his part, but he wasn't.There is none of the excellent humor that set a foundation for the tongue-in-cheek performances in Raiders and to a lesser extent the following two sequels.The improbability factor in much of the movie is astounding and the inclusion of useless scenes in also excessive <U+0096> I will give details: Climbing into a refrigerator will not protect you from being smashed and hurled hundreds of yards or more and crashing to the ground. When it crashes at 100 miles per hours you crash as though there was no refrigerator around you since, the last time I checked, there is no padding in one of these. And let's not even discuss the heat and radiation of the blast (lead will only protect so much). Ants cannot carry whole people away into their nest, nor do they possess tablespoons of goo in their bodies.Remember those house-sized rocks revolving at great speed around the spaceship as it took off? They would not just stop and drop when the ""magnetic"" field was gone, they would fly off and destroy all around them including all the observers who were just yards away.What the hell was the purpose of the motorcycle in the airplane? How long did that last.When Mutt was looking for Indy, he seemed not to know what he looked like. Wasn't it a tremendous coincidence that he happened to first choose the right person? And that he was on that side of the train and that the train could be stopped for him to get off (not explained was that?) After the initial contact with the FBI, they disappeared from the movie. There were more Russians than FBI on American soil after that scene.Is gunpowder magnetic? I think not. If the Cadaver in the warehouse was so magnetic that it would attract the gunpowder, why wasn't all the metal in the warehouse and being carried by the troops attracted similarly. Why was it that only those metal items the camera was focusing on where attracted. In fact, later in the movie, this magnetic field could be stopped by a cloth covering <U+0096> as if! An amphibious vehicle of the kind the main characters were riding in is not inherently a floating device. Like most ships, if water gets inside or they turn over (capsize) they will sink like a stone. Clearly, there were no sailors on board this cast or crew. For all the occupants to survive not one but three falls over falls the last of which looked like Niagara Falls is so comical as to be ridiculous. (btw, I know I overused that word). Why not make them a bit smaller and give the cast some trouble with the cascades so that we are anxious for their safety. When things are so absurd, the audience must suspend disbelief so greatly that at no time is it fearful for their survival.Mutt already had the skull, why did he risk death by continuing to sword fight? What's with the attacks by the natives? These occurred twice and neither was well explained, although the fear factor with them was probably the best in the movie.At the end the scene with Mac going crazy trying to gather the gold (and then dying) was so predictable, having been played out hundreds of times in other movies. Couldn't they have done something a bit different? Could Mutt really swing with the monkeys so as to catch up with speeding vehicles? Just where did he learn this skill while looking in mirrors and combing his hair? When Indy blew into the wrong end of the blowgun, the native shouldn't have died since the wrong end pierced him. In fact the wrong end isn't sharp at all or it would be impossible to discharge.Would the army place a highly secret and very important warehouse in close proximity to a nuclear test site? Not unless they wanted to destroy everything in that warehouse, which was unlikely. And while we are at it wouldn't these highly trained Russians know that a nuclear test was being conducted? Well, I have asked more questions here than can be explained in a lifetime of Indy movies. And I haven't asked them all. All I have to add is - I want my two hours back please!! 1"
La siciliana ribelle             ,danlougheed,1,crime,2008,NA,"This is a movie I would see again and again. The is the kind of film that pays tribute to the true cinematic experience: a perfectly told story with beautiful cinematography that lets us move along with the characters and took the necessary time to let us care about these people. Wonderfully directed, with awesome performances by the actors. While some directors might have chosen more violent scenes in this true account of going up against the mafia, Marco Amenta chose something we don't see too much in films anymore: imagination. This film unfolded rather than assaulted, tantalized rather than terrorized. Bravo!"
The Objective             ,Bravelaird,,horror,2010,10,"I only just caught this film and wanted to leave a brief open message for you here. An excellent, understated, intelligent and riveting piece of work. Wonderfully skilled. Using visual effects sparingly and to actually as plot points. Atmospheric. Truly disturbing with a great sense of alien territory and location. Outstanding and balanced performances. A wonderful score. I cannot fault a single element. This is an inspiration for film-makers using elliptical techniques and a low budget. I wish there were more films around like this. Very many thanks for your taking pains to make this one. Don't let the initial muted reaction to the film's release affect you. An outstanding creative exercise. (Jon Sorensen)"
The Merry Gentleman             ,craysellers,,crime,2009,4,"Kelly MacDonald has that quality about her that pulls the male ego into wanting to protect her. I felt it in ""The Girl in the Cafe,"" and I'll never forgive Javier Bardem for keeping his vow in ""No Country for Old Men."" ""The Merry Gentleman"" could be titled ""Who will Protect Kelly?"" Will it be the cop, the hit-man (Keaton) even her ""born-again"" husband?-they all want to protect her. Her husband is insane, and the cop offends her every time he speaks. Cold-blooded murderer Logan (Keaton), seems to win her heart with coughs, wheezing and repeating twice ""I found a girl under a Xmas tree."" Keaton's minimalist dialog even has him wheezing for her to quit talking and leave the hospital. If he charms her with any more silver-tongued devilry than that, it must have been edited out. I thought the ending worked; the part that was missing was 'What did she see in him"
Saw V             ,tom_lewis86,0,crime,2008,1,"Of all the SAW films so far this has to be the worst! Where all the others had twists you could never see coming or endings that nearly everyone was shocked by this film was a massive letdown.There was no imagination going into the traps in this film. They were nearly all as gruesome as possible with no real thought going into making them all seem different. They just seemed like nothing made any of them different or original.The size of some of the contraptions were ridiculous and totally unrealistic to have been made by any less than a team of probably half a dozen engineers. The SAW films have gone from being shocking but realistic situations like two men handcuffed to radiators in a room to completely far fetched unrealistic situations.As a huge fan of the series of films I was bitterly disappointed when the credits started to role and I just sat there thinking ""was that it?!"" Honestly this will ruin everything you love about the SAW films, if you love the rest then go and see it just to say you've seen it and so you can just get the tiny little bit of the story this film adds to. If you've never seen any SAW films before go and see ANYTHING but this film.I know this just sounds like a rant about how much I hated this film but if you've seen the rest, go and see it and I really think you'll agree with what I'm saying. Shockingly bad is my final thought! a real letdown in every way!-tom_lewis86-"
Frost/Nixon             ,WriterDave,0,misc,2008,8,"Ron Howard's competent film adaptation of Peter Morgan's play (who also scripted and co-produced here) dramatizes the famous Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977. At one point in the film, Kevin Bacon's character explains to Frank Langella's Nixon that a portion of the interview will focus on ""Nixon the man"". To which Nixon retorted, ""As opposed to what? Nixon the horse?"" Of course what was on everyone's mind at the time was Watergate and how American was never able to give Nixon the trial they so desperately wanted. Through the unlikely Frost interviews, the American people finally heard the truth behind the scandal--straight from the horse's mouth.Morgan's source material translates smoothly onto film. Much as he did with ""The Queen"", he mixes a behind the scenes look at the immediate time period leading up to the historical event and closes with an almost word-for-word dramatization of said event. Also, like ""The Queen"", we have the excellent Michael Sheen on board, who after playing Tony Blair now takes on the mannerisms of the legendary British talk-show host and man-about-town David Frost. Director Ron Howard nicely interweaves archival news footage, faux-post interviews with the secondary players, and the dramatic reenactments of the actual Frost/Nixon interviews. Howard's studied but pedestrian style of direction lends itself well to this type of docudrama as he allows the actual events to speak for themselves and the fine performances to shine on their own. Though it takes quite awhile to get where it's going, the final interview where Frost takes Nixon head-on about the Watergate cover-up is a payoff well worth the wait.Of course the most fascinating aspect of the film is Frank Langella's portrayal of a shamed and swollen Richard Nixon. He plays him as a fallen man desperate for an act of contrition but still in too deep with his old trickery and slick ways. His performance, and the way it connects with the audience, is wonderfully layered. On one level, we have an aged actor thought to be well past his prime firing back on all cylinders in a renaissance role that will likely lead to a showering of award nominations. The way the film reduces his performance to that one lingering close-up after being steamrolled by Frost on the last day of the interview leaves a lasting impression. But it also works on another level as it is meant to represent the reduction of Nixon's political life to that one lingering close-up on the television monitor when he realized it's all over for him. The audience members who remember watching the interviews and can picture the actual close-up they saw on their TV screens are now allowed to share a communion with the audience members who weren't even born yet and now only have a memory of Langella's face on the silver screen. In that sense, Langella truly became Nixon, and his performance will not soon be forgotten."
The Express             ,michaeltaddonioa,,misc,2008,8,"This fine film was, of course, about an athlete who was outstanding in what he did. It also was about the athlete overcoming racial prejudice at a time when this issue explode(1960s). Racial prejudice has always been around, no doubt about it. Ernie Davis worked hard to overcome the prejudice through his conduct and performance on the field and off it. Of course, there were the disagreements with teammates and the coaches. One was the game at West Virginia where the head coach didn't want Davis to score a touchdown because of the expected reaction to it. Davis didn't like and went against the coach. Davis was enough of a man to go to the coach and straighten things out with him, in a sense. Davis had the courage to tell the head coach the he needed to be for his players, and not against them. The head coach had an attitude change. He fought to get his players to stay in the same hotel in Dallas, but failed. He succeeded when he sided with his players about not going to the official trophies presentation party after the Cotton Bowl, instead going to a barbecue place where a black band performed. The trophies were brought to the Syracuse players by Cotton bowl officials.One of the comments about the film stated that this was an extension of a particular political campaign. Not true. It is about life and how to overcome difficulties in it. It is about accepting people as they are. The film is one to inspire. It is also one that states that things that are wrong needed to be constantly worked on to be corrected. The point can be made that it is both a history and sociological lesson.

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,revsolly,,adventure,2010,NA,"...they bothered making this movie? Anyone? I didn't think so.If you are looking for a coming-of-age movie, go rent Summer of '42. This is no Summer of '42.When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard gets more screen time, that is your first warning sign And, of course, for such an ""artsy"" movie, there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around, just to make it look ""artsy"".Sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of someone with bi-polar disorder.Miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her. She misrepresented an actual Pittsburgh native.Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style. Wow! Was this his first role after high school graduation?So, we have this weird triangle. Foster has a crush on Miller, but is with his boss/girlfriend. He can't take Miller to bed, & won't take his boss to bed. So, he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller, & watches them get it on.Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller get it on, a scene that we are ""treated"" to in every sloppy, moaning detail. Finally, just to round it all out, Foster & Sarsgaard get it on, with Foster in the Miller role. Now I know how 2 guys get it on (as if that was ever anything I needed to know).After all that, all that's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2. It gets me right in the pit of my stomach. Oh, wait! That was the pepperoni pizza I just had.I'd like back the time this movie took out of my life, please"
Stop-Loss             ,bkoganbing,0,drama,2008,7,"As it is in the Iraq War as it has been since wars started once mankind figured out how to use hunting tools as weapons, the nature of the soldier is to fight. The military man doesn't question policy or the reasons why he's in a war, he just does the best he can and try to survive. Which is what Sergeant Ryan Phillippe, hometown hero from Brazos, Texas who's done his tour of duty and is given the horrible piece of news that he's been ordered for another tour of duty in Iraq. They call it Stop-Loss hence the title of the film.Phillippe's last action in Iraq involved a nasty urban fire fight where some good friends were killed. He just wants to go back to civilian life and kick back. But the army wants his combat experience.What to do. Probably if Phillippe came from some liberal blue state he'd find a lot more sympathy in his course of action. But he comes from that reddest of red states, Texas. It's a whole different mindset there and his very upbringing is telling him he's got to shoulder the burden of arms again.Stop-Loss is a good film from director/writer Kimberly Peirce who brought us Boys Don't Cry. Stop-Loss is not as powerful as Boys Don't Cry still it sends a powerful if conflicted message for the young people today who might just contemplate a military enlistment.Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also in the film as Phillippe's fellow soldiers who have differing attitudes towards the army and the Iraq War. Hard to know what is right in a situation like this. Where you're brought up and by who might be the reason you take one course of action as opposed to another.For what Phillippe does and the rest do, you have to go see Stop-Loss. And this review is dedicated to all of the men and women in arms for the United States of America who carry out our policy and put their bodies and lives on the line for us. If our leaders err and they do many times, no blame should attach to them. They are the most precious resource of the United States of America."
Good Dick             ,hulu37,1,misc,2010,8,"Marianna Palka's Good Dick is a fascinating romantic drama with a take that on the genre that you probably haven't seen before (or at least done this well).A woman who goes to her local video store daily to rent soft core porn becomes the object of affection for the video clerk. It's a simple situational setup that masks the layers beneath. The woman is cold and distant and seemingly not interested in a relationship, of any kind, despite the constant attempts by the video clerk. In fact she treats him pretty bad. Not until the end when we meet her father do we really understand her. She's been sexually abused by him, the first man in her life, and that shapes how she interacts with other men. It now becomes interesting that her erotic interest lie in soft core porn (porn without penetration as the clerk tells her). The clerk too isn't without issues to be addressed. He's battled drug addiction which may explain his addictive personality and why he won't give up on her despite the vitriolic insults and humiliation she dishes.It's been said that hurt people hurt people, and that concept is exemplified well in this film. She treats him bad because that's what she knows. She maintains control of their relationship because she knows how awful it feels to be the one being controlled. Many times throughout the film she dominates him (even simulating rape) to humiliation, and it's painfully clear that she's been through hell.Through it all we are left with a hopeful ending. A confrontation with her father and reconciliation with her video clerk are small steps in her progression. In the end we're left with two damaged people moving forward together. Hopeful, indeed.(Be careful Googling this one - the title may lead you to the dark side of the we"
Wanted             ,Anonymous_Maxine,1,action,2008,9,"I wasn't excited to see Wanted. I'm back in America for the summer and I was going to the movies with a friend, and she has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with Angelina Jolie, so of course this was at the top of the list of movies to see. Personally I don't understand a lot of the hype about her as an actor, but I have to admit she looks good with a gun so I decided to check out the movie.In perusing some of the reviews on the IMDb, it seems that people either loved it or hated it. I liked it a lot, although you have to understand that it's what I call an over-the-top action movie, where everything is taken to the extreme (see ""Shoot 'Em Up""). With movies like this the goal is spectacle, not realism. Hence all of these piddly complaints about the physics involved in bending bullets are rendered meaningless.Why would you complain about realistic stunts when cars can flip through the air with precision and then accelerate off the side of a bus? Or when super-assassins can throw bullet curveballs? Is it not obvious what that this is not exactly cinema verite? I have to agree that some of the plot devices are a little witless (a magic loom that weaves fate? Come on...), but the action is outstanding to say the least. Angelina has clearly been working on her war face, every time she fired her gun and showed that grimace I could only imagine her in her cavernous mansion practicing for hours on end in front of a mirror, but especially in comparison to a lot of the garbage sent to theaters these days, the entertainment is high.The movie is loud, fast, and explosive, but not exactly a cognitive workout. It's great as an hour and a half of action entertainment, and it's also fun to pick out the scenes that feed off of other films, the most obvious to me being Office Space, one of my favorite comedies.I have only recently become aware of James McAvoy, after seeing The Last King of Scotland and Atonement (which, in a single shot, features, by McAvoy, one of the finest pieces of acting I've ever seen in a movie - see my Atonement review...), and while he doesn't exactly knock my socks off here with his performance, he's perfect for the role and pulls off a disillusioned blue-collar American perfectly. Add him to the list of British actors so talented that many moviegoers didn't even know he was British.To a greater extent than McAvoy, obviously, the great Morgan Freeman is also clearly just having a good time here. The material is distantly below his talents, as it is for McAvoy, but at the same time, I see no reason why actors of his caliber shouldn't do a movie like this every once in a while. Shoot 'Em Up, as well, is also distantly below the talents of Clive Owen, but MAN he was good in it! Angelina Jolie, however, fits right in here, because this is the kind of movie that she is best in. I am thrilled, by the way, to have read that she has been ordered to gain weight for her next role, partly so she will be attractive again, and partly so she won't faint on set, like she did while making this movie.At any rate, I won't say to ignore all of the bad press about the movie, because it's true that a lot of people won't like it, but it seems a perfect example of a movie that, if you go in with the right state of mind, it can be great fun. The cleverness of the highly choreographed stunts, for me, often outweighed my lack of belief. Enjoy!"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,eldersgrowdown,0,animation,2009,10,"I loved this film. Definitely the best film of the year in my opinion. It's full of inspiration. The film was written after the novel by Kate DiCamillo of the same name as the film. The novel won the 2003 Newbery Medal. I have just started listening to the audio book of the novel and it starts off just as inspiring.Although it is a children's fantasy film it has a whole lot for the adults. One of my favorite films to date. Fantastic, next to Peaceful Warrior. Not sure about the other comments on here, I guess we have to live with them. Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did, because I really loved it and so did everyone I spoke to that's seen it. With an all-star cast this movie truly stands out. Don't miss this one!"
W.             ,robertgrimm-1,0,misc,2008,8,"One word sums up how I felt while watching W: uncomfortable.I went into this film expecting more of an absurdist comedy than a tragedy. The level of realism was far beyond what I expected. For the most part, the cast, makeup, and casting crew did such a good job with the characters that it was very easy to imagine that these were not actors on the screen but the actual people. Josh Brolin's characterization of W was certainly Oscar-worthy.Even better than Brolin's part was Phedon Papamichael's photographic direction. The job of the Director of Photography is to bring the story to life through the creation of images to draw the attention of the viewer where the Director wants. Few films are as good of an example of this as W. Papamichael used the camera to force moral and emotional perspective in a way that I have rarely seen outside of the films of Stanley Kubrick. I've only seen the film once, viewing it as a complete work. I intend to watch it again to study the photography.Overall, I thought the film was fair in its treatment of the actual people involved. The most ardent Bush supporters will not like it, but to still be that supportive of him in the final months of his second term, you either have to not be paying attention or be uncritical in all of your thought. While artistic license was taken throughout the film, the portrayal of all events and people, with the possible exception of Dick Cheney, were far more grounded in reality and recorded history than I expected.The film made me uncomfortable on multiple levels, which is why it succeeds and deserves such a high rating. The portrayal of Bush's relationship with his parents, especially his father, forces the viewer to feel sorry for him. The overt religiosity that pervades the public service portion of his life must anger anyone who believes strongly in the separation of church and state. There are many moments when, with any other characters, the film should have generated much laughter. Only one moment in the film actually caused more than one person in the theater to laugh. I guess 4000+ dead soldiers drains the humor out of even the most hilarious gaffes.I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a realistic portrayal of historical events. I wish Stone had waited until Bush was out of office to make it, though. While it captures the major events that were involved in building the Bush legacy, it ends far too early. 1"
College Road Trip             ,devil_730,1,adventure,2008,6,"What a very bland movie, I know it was a live-action Disney movie but by half way through the movie I just wanted to shut it off. So how come did I rate it a 6/10? The last 30 minutes of the movie (not the last fifteen but the fifteen minutes before it.) There's one sequence that will literally move you to tears. The score is amazing, the timing is just right and it'll surely make up for the dull movie. Without that sequence, I probably would've rated it a 3/10. I know they try to make it appealing to kids, but if it the movie was more serious then I say we could've had a great movie. If you're looking for a good Disney film, then I say skip it. But, if your a father to daughter(s), I say see it - a lot of fathers can relate to this (although the movie is highly over exaggerated.) For a rather dull movie, it does have a lot of hear"
One Missed Call             ,Sam_Movie_Buff,0,horror,2008,6,"One Missed Call does not deserve a 2.8 rating, - it just doesn't. I think most people had an opinion of this movie before they even seen it. Most likely because it was simply ""another Japanese remake"", but that's unfair. If One Missed Call had been released before, lets say ""The Ring"" - the movie would have had a higher rating - and better reviews. But because we have had ""The Ring"", ""The Ring 2 "", ""The Grudge"", ""The Grudge 2"", ""Pulse"", etc.. (to name a few) people think they know what the're already gonna get from the film. I mean, I'm not gonna lie and say One Missed Call is really a lot different from those movies - cause it's not. But that doesn't mean to say it's not good or entertaining. I think If you get passed the whole Japanese thing - you will enjoy the movie for sure. The thing I like about these certain movies is, there is a lot of great suspense. There's no heads, legs, arms flying everywhere - it's better than that. These so called Hollywood ""creators"" now think a horror film can only be a horror if there is blood & guts splattered everywhere. That's not true. A great horror has great suspense, and One Missed Call delivers just that."
Street Kings             ,C-Younkin,,misc,2008,8,"""Street Kings"" definitely has the street-cred. Keanu looks real bad-ass, Forrest Whittaker looks like he's digging back into the character he played on ""The Shield"", writer director David Ayer is no stranger to life on the cop circuit, having written ""Dark Blue"" and ""Training Day among others, and the movie also brings on the token rappers for good measure in Common and The Game. But does it work? Reeves plays Tom Ludlow, a Vice detective on a Special Forces unit in LA, led by Ludlow's friend and former partner Captain Wander (Forrest Whittaker). Ludlow's a dirty cop, but he feels in a good way. He'll execute and then tweak the crime scene if it means taking the low-lifes off the streets for good.His former partner Terrance Washington (Terry Crews) doesn't see it that way though, as he is in the midst of ratting him out to the head of Internal Affairs, Captain Biggs (Hugh Laurie). When he finds out, Tom follows Washington around, walking right into a convenience store robbery where Washington is gunned down execution style. Wander tells Tom he'll take care of it, but Tom is a man who values justice more than anything. He partners with a homicide detective named Diskant (Chris Evans) to follow the evidence and solve the murder.The movie, by David Ayer, couldn't be more hard-core. It's filled with riveting gun-battles and fights and it's a movie not afraid to show some real brutal violence and blood. The verbal exchanges between characters are also exceptionally written, heated and intense with a good ear for dialogue. My favorite line by far this year is ""Why don't you do the department a favor and clean your mouth out with a buck-shot."" And the story pulls off a compelling morality play, sending Tom up a ladder of murder and corruption, and at the same time, climbing him further toward his own redemption. Sure, you can probably see the ending coming if your paying close enough attention, but think about it, the movie couldn't end in a better way.This is the kind of movie Reeves is excellent in, giving his character edge and toughness but also never losing track of the character's underlying moral dilemma. Whittaker is also incredible in this movie, sinking his teeth into a character who's basically portrayed as ""The Godfather"" of LA. Hugh Laurie shows up every once in a while, the character feels underwritten though. Chris Evans does a decent job, Cedric The Entertainer and Jay Mohr are nice additions who add some comedy, and it's a small role but Naomie Harris deserves a shout-out for playing the down-to-earth voice of reason character.""Street Kings"" is hard-nosed, gritty film-making. The cast is right on the money, the writing and direction is terrific, and the action couldn't be more exciting. The year is still young but this is one of my favorite films so far. "
Garden Party             ,demaym,1,drama,2009,NA,"Firstly, If you enjoy generic, safe, and predictable movies, like the ones 'Hollywood' often churn out, then you might not enjoy, or appreciate, this gutsy offering....As we all know, independent movies are rather 'hit and miss', usually because they push the boundaries, regarding the industry standard rules, when it comes to the directing, production and writing.When an independent movie gets it right, it can be overly refreshing and satisfying.The first risk that 'Garden Party' takes, is that it refuses to give the viewers a recognisable lead character to follow. Instead, the first segment of the movie sets up the premise for several diverse characters, separately, each with their own story and subplot. This is dangerous, for any movie, as trying to follow multiple amounts of plots at once can easily become annoying, and result in an overload, causing the viewer to switch off in frustration. Luckily, in this particular case, it works, and the stories, and characters, quickly begin to intertwine and link with each other.We are introduced to a homeless, pretty boy, up and coming pop/rock singer, who remains placid and confused, as his ultra rise to stardom begins out of nowhere, and he starts to attract attention from promoters, beautiful women, and artists. We then have a young, attractive girl, from a questionable upbringing, who is encouraged by some friends, to get into the soft core porn industry. A young man, who has forgotten who he is, due to being on 24 hour duty to his control freak boss, in real estate, and drug pushing. A ruthless, sexy, and manipulative business women, who does anything to get what she wants, with a soft spot for losers, who she can mould and control. Other characters include an obsessive rich pervert, a seedy photographer, and a pot head who with no ambition.The movie runs along, at a fairly fast pace, and you suddenly begin to care about each character and their individual story. Whether it be in a good, or bad way, you are waiting for closure on each characters subplot, which eventually kind of combines into one big plot.Sex, and taboos, play a big part in the movie, but somehow, and strangely, the movie manages to be quite tasteful, and although sex, drugs, booze and porn are frequently mentioned, it manages to be non offensive, with no real smut element. Its realistic.With a mixture of comedy, drama, and passion, this one should keep you entertained throughout.I like this movie because it has the guts to be a bit different. Exploring scenarios that most movies wouldn't touch, and generally going with the flow. This adds excitement, and an unpredictable element for the viewer.Great acting, interesting soundtrack, good writing, and good directing.I would recommend this film to anybody with an open mind - 8/"
The Duchess             ,adnarish,1,misc,2014,5,"I'm of two minds about this film. On the one hand, Saul Dibb has managed to turn a book into an entertaining film about the trials and tribulation - and, let's keep things in perspective, extremely privileged life - of the frolicking Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). It hits all the targets of the romantic genre, and does so with a nice mix of emotional scenes, witty banter, and even some interesting discussions.Some, because on the other hand the film fails to step beyond the confines of its genre and to really engage with the historical period in which the events take place. The female protagonist gets married to a Duke (Ralph Fiennes), is supposedly unhappy (but wastes little time exploiting the new social options presented to her because of said marriage), and soon the viewer is on board with Georgiana for a ride through all the familiar scenes: her husband's mistresses, her own dalliances with young dreamers, an unexpected pregnancy, etc. etc. The political scheming in the background is mentioned, but there is very little interaction between the events of the story and the historical context. In the final minutes of the film, lines of text assure the viewer that Georgiana was one of the most influential women of her day (in England, one assumes). Unfortunately, not much of that supposed influence is shown in the film, where Georgiana has to make do with a short scene in which she rallies a crowd of a few dozen spectators at a political campaign event.It's all the more unfortunate that this angle of Georgiana's character was left underexposed, because in the first few minutes of the film she quickly finds herself in a rather witty back-and-forth with one of her husband's political allies, Charles Fox (Simon McBurney). Those scenes, so teasingly shown in the trailer, are sadly moved to the sidelines soon after. If those reading this felt similarly disappointed by this, I can recommend Patrice Leconte's 1996 film Ridicule. It's an excellent and very witty look at the French court in roughly the same time.So all in all, if you're looking at this film as a romantic historical drama, it's actually not all that bad. But unfortunately it's also not much more than that. A shame, especially because this is an era in which there should be no shortage of great characters from which to draw inspiration for far more interesting stories and films.A final note on the acting: Ralph Fiennes is great as William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, as is Simon McBurney as the politician Charles Fox. Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell gave two decent but unexciting (which isn't necessarily bad) performances as Charles Grey and Bess Foster respectively. As for Georgiana herself? I can understand directors are reluctant to use different actors for the same role, but wanting a 22 year old Keira Knightley to portray both a 17 year old newly-wed and a 35 year old mother was perhaps a bit too much to ask. Knightley makes the most of it, and some scenes are well done indeed, but on the whole it wasn't really working out for me.Recommended for easy romantic watching, not so for an engaging historical dram"
35 Shots of Rum             ,youllneverbe,0,drama,2009,NA,"""35 Rhums"" (2008) Dir.: Claire Denis'35 Rhums' is a slow, elliptical and deliberate film revolving around the four tenants of a house in what appears to be the greater Paris area. At its core are a father (Lionel) and his late-teenage daughter (Josephine), with the middle-aged taxi driver Gabrielle and the impulsive young Noe, living downstairs with his cat, rounding off a kind of extended family. They seem closer than your usual co-tenants and there's a suggested intimacy behind their functional and un-dramatic interactions, though this is all left unexplained for quite some time; indeed, so much so that it's tempting for the viewer to wonder if they've missed some crucial dialogue or failed to infer something that Claire Denis has intended them to. But this is a film that rewards not only patience but also a keen eye for behavioural detail. The realism of '35 Rhums' lies in its understatement of the relationships, shared histories, and occurrences (large and small) that make up the story. This is, I think, one of the finer points of the film, though it only became apparent upon further reflection.Lionel is a train driver and his daughter is a student. The absence of a mother in the apartment is immediately clear but, like many other aspects of the film, the specifics are not elaborated on as part of the setup. Neither is the wistfulness of Gabrielle as she chain-smokes and awaits Lionel's return home from nights at work, where his co-worker Rene is depressed about his upcoming retirement. (We see that the colleagues are as close-knit as the tenants.) Noe is restless and muses on his tendency not to settle anywhere too long. In an amusing scene, he discovers his aged cat has died in her sleep and offhandedly decides to take a job in Angola because there's nothing to stick around for any longer. This upsets Josephine, and she takes off to Germany with her father for a few days.All this occurs within a fairly short time frame, and in between we are shown glimpses of the unexplained histories that made the first half of the film a little vague. In fact, there is a particular scene where I felt that the movie really connected itself: Gabrielle's cab breaks down on the way to a concert, and the four co-tenants are sheltered from a rainstorm in an empty bar. Resigned to the evening's ruined plans, they eat and drink away, and over this long set piece all the hints and glances and suggestions of the preceding scenes are brought together and made into something tenable. From here, '35 Rhums' leads us successfully through moments of comedy, tragedy and finality. Crucially, it never changes its pace or its observational filming style after this point. To do so would cheapen the tone of the introductory hour, and be rather jarring at that. It reaches its end without any great resolution, which could be seen as a weakness by anyone still expecting a traditional climax by this stage. But if you're already this far into the film (and this review), that probably doesn't apply to you. We are left to assume that the characters' lives simply go on, though not unchanged by certain events and discoveries that I won't spoil for anyone here.The impression I came away with is that '35 Rhums' is an intimate film about the culmination of people, events of the past and present, and how these can close off little chapters of our lives and sometimes go unnoticed. It is not for everyone, and it is definitely not flawless - there's some dangling symbolism to do with rice cookers (yup, you read right), and I can't work out if Claire Denis is trying to make a social point with the virtually all-black casting. Aside from a short scene at the university where students are discussing the Third World debt, it seems to be entirely incidental (which, in turn, makes the dialogue in that scene appear incidental also). But my knowledge of urban French societal make-up is nil, so I can't comment further. It is essentially a decent and touching work, very well acted and captured, and if you have patience and aren't averse to a definite French style, then it could be your kind of movie."
A Christmas Tale             ,onutsa93,1,comedy,2018,1,"The most boring and empty movie I have ever tried to see. It took me minutes in 4 days to finish it. No ending, no philosophy, no deep moments, nothing. Truly the worst movie, French movie I had to se"
Ponyo             ,jmaruyama,1,animation,2008,7,"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories. The story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea sprite/goldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in Southern Japan (based on Seto Island) where he lives with his young mom, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke names the strange goldfish ""Ponyo"" and takes it to the daycare/nursing center that Lisa works at. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects (she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat) by sampling some blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. Yet just as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is taken back by her father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the world's oceans.Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong however that Fujimoto is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see Sosuke. During her breakout, Ponyo unintentionally releases Fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding Sosuke's town. Desperate to resolve Ponyo's rebellion, he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother - the water elemental, Mother/Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). As with his past films, Miyazaki's ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is at times sobering when Ponyo encounters a drudging vessel which is scraping the ocean's floor, uncovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans, yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavor.Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film. It is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious. Clearly Miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. It is almost like a child's color book come to life.Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do great work as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring adorable charm to their roles. Nara Yuria in particular sounds so darn cute as Ponyo that it is little wonder that Doi's Sosuke falls for the magical girl. Former campaign girl/model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as Sosuke's modern mom, Lisa. I was a bit confused at first by her character as I initially thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also didn't help that Sosuke kept referring to her as ""Lisa"" rather than Mom but I guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mom by first name as well).80s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different as the serious Fujimoto but wisely doesn't make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing. While we don't get to know his character more, former pro-baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige ( who portrays Sosuke's father Koichi) also delivers some nice voice work. The opening theme ""Umi No Okasan"" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring. In contrast the Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi ""Geke No Ue No Ponyo"" theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like ""Die Walküre"".The film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a back seat to some of Miyazaki's overwhelming fantastical visuals. I also had wished we had more time to explore Fujimoto's back-story as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father.Like ""Kiki's Delivery Service/Majo No Takkyubin"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""Princess Momonoke/Momonoke Hime"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro/Tonari No Totoro"", ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" is another Miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes. Like a modern day fairytale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come."
Ghost Town             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,misc,2008,6,"After a stressful day, I needed a good comedy to lighten up my mood and I had been hearing a lot of good things on Ghost Town. So I saw it last Sunday, over all I think it was a pretty funny comedy, although I wasn't laughing as hard as the other audience members, but I had a nice time watching it, I think the reason why was due to how predictable it was. For example... the lead character can talk to ghosts, what do we constantly see in ghost movies? The character who can see or speak to ghosts looks crazier because they talk to the ghosts right in front of people who obviously can't see or hear the ghosts. The story was also a typical romantic comedy that wasn't really original. But one thing I was impressed with this movie was how strong Ricky Gervais held his own as a male lead, with Greg Kinnear, they made a good match. They both had great comedic timing and looked like they had a great time making this movie.Bertram Pincus doesn't have the best social skills when it comes to life... he constantly pushes people away, he's a dentist who doesn't care for his patients or co-workers, and he just wants to be left alone. Well, for what is a routine surgery, he dies for a few minutes, but is brought back to life. Later on he discovers that he can see and hear ghosts, as soon as they hear this, they go on a rampage to get him to talk to their loved one's they left behind to cross over with making sure their family is taken care of. But one specific ghost, Frank, wants Bert to talk to his widow who's with a guy he doesn't approve of, but of course Bert socializes with her realizing that maybe needing people isn't so bad and that love can be found once again.Ghost Town is worth the look, but I would recommend it more so for a matinée or a rental, it's a cute movie, just doesn't have a real comedic edge in my opinion. But it does have some good laughs in it and a nice story that will make you smile. But there is another problem I have, Bert gets hit by a bus... he is revived by Frank's wife's ex-fiancée, by C.P.R.? You get hit by a bus, you should be splattered into pieces, but instead all apparently it takes is C.P.R. and you'll be just fine. Sorry for the spoiler, but if anyone who saw this movie read this, I wonder if you agree as well? I know it's a movie, but geez, call this beyond unrealistic. Over all, it's a nice movie, but it didn't thrill me, it's good for a couple laughs, that's about it.6/10"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,unscripted1,1,comedy,2008,9,"I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on ""the list"" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like ""Superbad"", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Superbad"", or ""Knocked Up"".For starters, there was a definite presence of the ""TV actors on the big screen"" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of ""That 70s Show"" didn't follow her to ""Forgetting""'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that ""Forgetting"" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than ""American Psycho 2"" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on ""CSI"") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious ""American Psycho 2""); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with ""Superbad""). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt ""Knocked Up""). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write ""Fun with Dick and Jane"".All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically. 2"
Summer Hours             ,babevac2,1,drama,2008,8,"Hélène Berthier, niece of a famous painter, receive her children and grand children for her birthday, and take this opportunity to talk about her death, and what will happen to her uncle's collection. Once dead, Frederic, her elder son think that they'll keep the house as it his, but his brother and sister don't live in France anymore and think that it would more intelligent to sell. When I was expecting the family to be destroyed around this heritage, nothing like that happens, they all accept and the rarity in the 21 century of families having things that could belong to museums takes an end. This film is extremely beautiful, for many reasons. First because it can touch everyone who lost someone and saw what was theirs, being sold and put in many places. Then this film is beautiful because it shows also how everyone accepts that but also suffers from what they can't keep together: family, past, heritage! To me it shows better than any Amelie, or La Vie en Rose what being French means: being thorn between the heritage of a culture and an appeal of modernity, wanting to keep your roots alive and spread toward the world. This is funny how this thought came through my mind ""Why do they want to live in Beijing or New York?"" suddenly being in the film, that seemed weird to me when I just lived two years and a half in London, and probably won't stay in my old country forever. The actors are great, Edith Scob playing the extremely classy Hélène, and Charles Berling, Jeremy Regnier and Juliette Binoche are very touching and human. It's important to say, that the object are also characters in this story, and it's scary at the end to see them in the museum d'Orsay, how they lost life or are recovering some. It's important to say that this film was a project with the museum, and I think that it is brilliant to make us pay attention to the details of these objects when generally we're not. Question: is art made for museum or to live with it? People wouldn't try to steal them from museum if the answer was museums<U+0085> If you want to see my other critics: http://www.silverparticules.blogspot.com"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,subwayforlife80,0,drama,2011,5,"OK there two versions of this movie. The 2008 version I give 3 1/2 stars. Great score and good ending. The 2011 American release with entirely different score (score sucks), is mediocre at best. The score made the 2008 version good. I don't know why the producers ruined the original version, probably just to get an American release. I don't why Hollywood takes a potentially good idea and turns it into crap. This movie was Oscar worthy until they changed the entire me with it's crap 2011 ending. Watch the 2008 version online or import DVD...2008 9 stars. 2011= 5 1/2 stars.

The Burning Plain             ,TxMike,1,misc,2010,NA,"Curious movie, but overall very good. It was a bit disconcerting the way it is edited, because the first 40 to 45 minutes it skips back and forth and you have to guess what period you are in, and who the characters are, and what their relationships are. But if you stick with it, all becomes clear.Charlize Theron is Sylvia, she is the manager of a restaurant on the Pacific in Oregon. She seems very tough and very efficient, knows her foods and knows her wines. But her weakness is a promiscuous lifestyle, performed in an almost matter-of-fact way. It is as if she has a low self-esteem, in spite of being smart and pretty.Kim Basinger is Geena, a seemingly happily married mother of several healthy children. Her husband has a job that takes him on the road often and, since her surgery for breast cancer he seems unable to make love to her as he once did.Their oldest child is Jennifer Lawrence as Mariana, probably 17. (She was actually 17 during filming.) She loves her mother, but doesn't like her at all when she starts to suspect she might have something going on, on the side.John Corbett (Northern Exposure's ""Chris in the Morning"") is John, a chef at Sylvia's restaurant, married, and having an affair with Sylvia.This is a very good movie, with an interesting and moving story of redemption.SPOILERS follow: First off, when all is revealed Sylvia in modern times is the grown up Mariana, 12 years later. Her promiscuity is a result of seeing her mother's affair, then being responsible for her death, and the death of her lover, a man also with a family. Mariana suspected something so on her bicycle followed her mom's car to a remote area in desert-like terrain in New Mexico, and found their love nest, an old trailer they had fixed up. She loosened the gas supply, and set fire while the two lovers were in there, to scare them out and destroy the place, but it blew up and she killed both of them. Then she started an affair with the man's son, they had a child, Mariane ran away when the child was 2 days, went to Oregon, and changed her name to Sylvia. But they eventually found her and she went to Mexico, to be reunited with her daughter and her lover, now in the hospital recuperating from an injury form a crop duster crash.Tessa Ia who plays her 12 year old daughter Maria is cute and also a good young actres"
Gran Torino             ,come2whereimfrom,0,drama,2008,8,"Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it's a real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both. 1"
Frost/Nixon             ,Chris Knipp,0,misc,2008,8,"It didn't seem so in the run-up to the event, but British talk show host/interviewer David Frost's 1977 series of four on screen encounters with the disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon was great, historic television. This movie directed by Ron Howard successfully transfers the Peter Morgan play about the event to the big screen. Arguably, the story belonged here all along. The paraphernalia of a Hollywood production enables Howard to gussy up this claustrophobic event with such acoutrements as the luxury suite of a 747, Nixon's ""smart"" seaside villa La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente, and the impressive, downright menacing sight of a presidential motorcade. As the train of glittering, dark limos approach the Nixon friend's house where the interviews were shot it feels like a battalion of tanks; and Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall), the British socialite Frost chats up on the plane and makes his consort for the duration of the exploit seems the more slinky and glamorous for emerging from a posh airplane rather than a bare stage. Lighting tricks and artful camera angles help make Frank Langella morph more successfully into Nixon than his physicality would otherwise permit. Michael Sheen as Frost already seems to look and sound like his character, and the ""monkey suit"" blue blazer outfits add the final touch. His task is easier; we don't know so well or care so much what Frost was like. In the film version, both performances take on more nuance. Langella's performance on camera brims of with dyspeptic melancholy, aggression, and self-pity; Michael Sheen's as frost glitters with a muted, hysterical cheer mixing infantilism and fear. The extra visuals of a film also help to show Nixon's comfort and loneliness and Frost's sleazy playboy side.It's important that the fakery should work well, because the movie must provide lots of closeups that those in the balcony didn't see. So long as it works, the feeling of TV interviews is better achieved in the film, and the actors don't have to yell. The camera, sometimes annoyingly jerky, but in the best moments simply direct and relentless, does their yelling for them.So I'm saying this is a winner. Peter Morgan after all did the screenplay, and he's no stranger to such efforts--notable examples of his film writing are in The Last King of Scotland and The Queen; a rather less notable one is The Other Boleyn Girl. The flaws are simply in the events. For three of the interview parts, till it gets to Watergate in the fourth, Nixon seems to be winning. Despite a dramatic intervention by Nixon support staffer Col Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) to prevent an abject breakdown, Nixon does buckle under in part four. But his admissions still remain in the realm of generality, and there is the question: does anything said on TV really matter? The audience for a West End or Broadway play is a bit different from the popcorn crowd and how appealing this film will be to the mainstream is uncertain. Needless to say it's all talk and minimal action. For students of contemporary American history nonetheless the topic is thrilling. Frost used his own money for down payments. In need of cash and highly mercenary, Nixon used the celebrity agent Swiftie Lazar (Toby Jones) to get $600,000 for the interviews. Frost lost sponsors and the US networks refused to come aboard. He made down payments from his own funds and borrowed. He hired two journalists, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), to do support research. Reston was a firebrand opponent of Nixon. He refused to participate unless there was a commitment to shame Nixon and get him to admit he did wrong in Watergate and betrayed the country's trust.The issue was whether Frost had the depth to tackle a job like this. He wanted a Watergate confession too, but he let Nicon play him with small talk (despite the man's claim that he was no good at it) and temporize with lengthy self-serving reminiscences that blunted most of Frost's pointed questions. This is where Zelick and especially Reston come in to give a sense of urgency. Again the film excels where the play couldn't in showing Nixon's walk out to his car after each encounter, jubilant at first, pathetic at the end.Ultimately both in the play and the film, Frost's victory seems a hollow one, of little significance to morality or history. This is above all a story about television. In that arena, this was a coup. and there is great drama in how close Frost's project came to failing. As the encounters got under way, he was losing every sponsor, and later he lost his Australian show, having some time earlier lost his American one. The film tells us they all came back, and then some. Frost never really seems to have reentered the world of American television, but he has had many projects in England and is said now to be ""worth £20 million,"" with a live weekly current affairs program on Al Jazeera English. Nixon is dead, and though he may have won three rounds out of four in the Frost interviews, his legacy is tainted.The show belongs to Sheen and Langella, but Bacon is excellent as the stiff, loyal Col. Brennan, and Sam Rockwell strong in an unusually serious role for him. As Nixon's somewhat lost wife Pat, the child star of The Bad Seed Patty McCormack is touching. There are lots of other actors, far more than in the stage production, and the best thing is they don't get in the way. San Clemente also plays a significant role. The brightness and beauty of Nixon's ocean-side estate helps dramatize his depression by contrast. There were doubts about putting Howard in charge of the screen version, but they were groundless. 1"
Gran Torino             ,williamzim2000,0,drama,2008,10,"This is a poignant, beautiful movie, maybe the best film Eastwood has ever done. The characters are fully drawn, believable, and resonate true human emotion. I at first was put off by the idea of seeing a movie about an old racist, but when I saw the numbers of people attending the screenings, I thought there must be something there, so I went to the Arclight in Hollywood, where the theater was packed. Crusty old Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, now living in run down Detroit, hates the Vietnamese immigrants that have moved next door to him. As time goes on, he gets to know them, and the bond that forms is wonderful, and spiritual. There was not a dry eye in the house when the movie ended. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say this is a truly wonderful story, one that you will love and tell your friends to see. If you're looking for one of those great movie experiences that so rarely comes along, you'll not find a better film to see than this. 3"
Summer Hours             ,stuka24,1,drama,2009,4,"Maybe it was the constant mention of designer art's items, supposedly of great value and extremely beautiful, which I found inane. Or it may have been its slowness, or its lack of emotional meaning to me. The case is that I think this film lacks ""soul"", ""purpose"" or even ""beauty"". I liked the way the 3 generations view differently their relationship with things. The older generation valued and lived with Art. The middle aged successful professionals strive between personal attachment to one item or another, and their need for money to develop their professional and personal lives. And the young... the only part that I thought meant something -although it wasn't very nice to look at- was near the end, at the teenager's party, one of the grandsons said, when confronted to the Corot paintings: (uninvolved and trying to be diplomatic) ""they belong to another age"". His parent Frédéric didn't seem to notice, but there lied the heart of the issue. The youngsters play ball inside the formerly beautiful French country mansion, listen to horrible rap speaking of social violence, or bubble gum female pop, smoke marijuana, drink heavily, behave and look like they didn't care anything for whatever could be inside the D'Orsay museum or something.Demagogy: Of course on the other hand you have the daughter, who besides shoplifting and having awful manners shows she's sensitive for her grandma and has longings for the house. I thought that unlikely and unwarranted by what we see of her before. And the about 5 times we get to see ""the phone that the sons gave for the mum and didn't fix for her"". Hey, who hasn't forgotten something for somebody who loves, specially when in a hurry and while dealing with difficult issues like succession planning? I think I'd be hard to accuse specially the emotional Frédéric of not loving the elegant Éloïse! Or the maid ""attempting in vain to enter the mansion, and then, beleaguered, leaving some flowers in her tomb"". OK, she is faithful even on the afterlife, but I found the portrayal of it rather leftish like ""only the poor have true feelings, and don't care for the money (when she takes 'only a flower pot') and are well bred (the moving letter even the devoted son didn't make himself time to answer) and who have perfectly good feelings (the emotional relative with the cab, leaving her at her mono block housing). By the way, Isabelle Sadoyan plays the part of Éloïse very convincingly! A distinguished lady who says, at the most beautiful image of the film by far: ""When I die, so will my secrets, that interest no one"" (the scene with blue lighting, at dusk). Her character has some Chabrolesque undertones. I mean ""the upper classes who hold some secrets in the sake of moral respectability"", ""big mansions of the elite holding rather selfish people"". Her daughter Adrienne seemed to take after the mother in the manipulativeness and ironic remarks like ""this is a true present"" and her rant against globalization and Jérémie's business. The mother at least has class! Anyway, Binoche is convincing at her unlikeable character, totally different to her usual ""beauty at 40"" ones. I enjoyed the director's Les Destinées sentimentales way more. At least that was a true melodrama, with beautiful settings and old fashioned feelings. I'm afraid he could have done here something more authentic,for instance, as ""the decadence of values"" -like the house itself-. Instead, he obviously feels like Frédéric who says to his wife something awfully stupid about works of art ""having to live in the proprietor's house, for the seem 'trapped' in a museum"". Even if it's true that most museum goers don't care much for what they're force fed like hamster: a) They could have sold them. The high tax they have to endure is an accident of French bureaucracy, not a moral imperative. Besides, b) how many people enjoy works that way (in private collections, like F. extols)? For instance, how many people would have enjoyed, say, this wooden desk had it remained at their haughty house? So if you want to be a socialist like most French intellos do, I think it'd be at least more coherent that they accept ""socialized"" art instead of harping on a romantic vision of ""art for those who 'really value it' that besides being rather arbitrary and potentially 'fascist', it is rather self-centered and childish.Overall, I think this film delivers much less than what it promises. But, as always, it's better than the average US blockbuster, that's for sure!"
The Ruins             ,TheEmulator23,,adventure,2008,4,"There are so many problems with this movie it's almost comical. Mostly I will just say that in order to have a good horror movie you have to have some scares or suspense or something. This really tried to be good and the actors did the best they could with the terrible script. Don't watch this unless you want to be scared of plants, that's right plants!!! Sorry I realize that is a spoiler but that is it folks a vine is what you are supposed to be scared of! I might have read the book that supposedly Stephen King thought was good. I hope he skips this joke of a film. Try watching some good horror movies. Oh wait they are all PG-13 pieces of garbage. We finally get an R-rated one and it blows! I don't know when we will get a good Horror film again, but I sure hope Clive Barker or Wes Craven can come up with some NEW horror material. That' right I want some NEW material, but as long as all these dang kids keep going to watch all these re-hashed flicks, the rest of us are going to have to continue to endure them! It is because of terrible movies like this that remakes keep happening. Although I didn't like this (at all) I was glad to at least try out a NEW horror flick. Please don't go see ""Prom Night"" or we will keep having to see more remade 70's & 80's films!"
I Sell the Dead             ,ltlacey,,misc,2010,3,"I'm sure if I could have understood a lot of the dialogue this movie might have been rated higher, but alas, what with the ""Cockney"" accents and mumbling, and sometimes the background noise/music was too loud, well, I missed probably a lot of the jokes and why a scene could have been good. I did read of others needing to turn on the subtitles, if available, and also how some ""Brits"" said bad things about us ""Yanks"" because we cannot understanding them; but rest assured that a lot of us cannot understand more and more American-made movies, starring American actors, much either. There is too much mumbling, talking too fast, or the dialogue is drowned out. That being said, from what I could get out of this movie, I found it a little different, but also wondered just what this movie was supposed to be. Another movie, in a growing list I'm afraid, of misled genres, so to speak. This movie is a comedy-horror, but other than a few scenes, and the one on the beach with the ghouls, I did not find a lot of this movie funny. Clever yes, funny no. But you can be clever only so long. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!! And I figured that our ""hero"" was going to be saved one way or another at the end. That was very obvious, made more so after the island scene with the undead. I think younger audiences will like this movie much more than us Old Folks, so if you're an AARP member, stick with Streep"
Four Christmases             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,comedy,2008,6,"Four Christmases starring Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn, I suppose I can accept it, just very strange seeing them as a couple on screen together. But anyways, every year we get a Chrismas movie, it's either going to be fun or really bad, sorry to say, but Four Christmases is nothing special, another year with an easy to forget movie. But still while this movie doesn't really stand out and it is incredibly predictable, there are some really fun moments. We at least finally have the split up family vs just one crazy family. Reese really turned on the charm and stole this movie, she was so adorable and she was great in the jump jump scene with the evil kids. Vince had some moments as well, but it's more the supporting cast that was just a fun addition to the story.When upscale, happily unmarried San Francisco couple Kate and Brad find themselves socked in by fog on Christmas morning, their exotic vacation plans morph into the family-centric holiday they had, until now, gleefully avoided. Out of obligation-and unable to escape-they trudge to not one, not two, but four relative-choked festivities, increasingly mortified to find childhood fears raised, adolescent wounds reopened...and their very future together uncertain. As Brad counts the hours to when he can get away from their parents, step-parents, siblings and an assortment of nieces and nephews, Kate is starting to hear the ticking of a different kind of clock. And by the end of the day, she is beginning to wonder if their crazy families' choices are not so crazy after all.I would recommend Four Christmases just if you wanna see a cute holiday movie in the theater this year. Vince and Reese had good chemistry and this movie just represents the craziness of having to go to all the families every year for Christmas. There are some really good laughs here and there, I loved the scene where Reese played the Virgin Mary and Vince was Joesph in their church play and Reese just gets stage fright and freezes while Vince just makes a fool of himself on stage. Over all this is a cute movie, there's nothing special about it, but it's worth the look.6/10"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,vinov1260,0,animation,2008,2,"While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the show) did it's job well, most other elements fell flat. It was as though the filmmakers thought ""well, it's gonna be 3-D so we don't have to work that hard on the plot or character development."" And the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse. The public is drawn to three dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics. The only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional Scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight.And the absolute kicker? Buzz Aldrin's appearance at the very end (after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half) comes on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the film's main characters ""contaminants"" and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility.???!!!??? Did you just wanna tell the kids the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus don't exist while you're at it"
The Merry Gentleman             ,rooprect,,crime,2010,8,"The main character doesn't say a word for the first half hour. But in that half hour, if we're paying attention, we get more insight into the depths of a man's soul than if we had just read his 500-page autobiography.The Merry Gentleman is billed as a crime drama, but that label hardly does it justice. The same way ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" broke the spy genre, the same way ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" broke the scifi genre, the same way ""Pink Floyd -The Wall"" ain't no average musical, this film is anything but your average crime drama. For starters, there's not a single car chase, gunfight, blimp explosion or any of the standard crime drama clichés. Instead, the tension & suspense is masterfully built around secrets. We begin with a secret which only the main character and the audience know. Then there is a secret which the 2nd character only knows (which the audience must slowly piece together). And finally, we have the main character's ultimate secret which is so cryptically presented that it may take you a few days of introspection before you figure it out.This film is very much like a challenging poem whose meaning is elusive at first glance but whose mood & style sinks into your mind over time. Dialogue is sparse, but every line packs a whollop. In particular, pay attention to the analogy of ghosts & angels which crops up several times both verbally & visually. One of the characters says something like ""Ghosts and angels are the same, except ghosts are haunted while angels are blessed."" OK, it may not mean much at first, but by the end of the film the significance is absolutely beautiful.Which brings me to the cinematography: absolutely beautiful. I'm no film school student, but I know what images affect me, and these scenes certainly did. Contrast (gleaming white snowflakes at night), perspective (long corridors at the morgue), symmetry (a lonely theatre marquee) and surrealism (a Christmas tree burning in a wheat field) are just some of the artistic touches you have in store. I can honestly say that I cannot think of a finer directoral debut than Michael Keaton in The Merry Gentleman.I won't even get into the first rate acting, the haunting musical score, or Katie's adorable accent. This movie is just about perfect. The only reason why I'm giving it only 8 stars instead of 10 is that I'm a real hardass.By the way, DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. DO NOT READ THE DVD DESCRIPTION. AVOID ALL DISCUSSION OF PLOT. This movie is best enjoyed if you know absolutely nothing about the story. The challenge (and the fun) will be even greater."
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,breklor,0,animation,2008,2,"Okay, so, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot.I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills, like a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG wasn't Pixar-quality, but it was generally good. The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics, with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies, African-American flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises).The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, relying on offensive and outdated clichés (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, a fat fly who only wants to eat, grade-two level gross-out humour). In a movie aimed for IMAX, they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing burn? PLEASE.) They couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap.But we liked the maggots.So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. Uh, yay. 1.5/5."
Gomorrah             ,trpuk1968,,crime,2008,10,"yes agree with all of the above comments. Not much to add except the film clearly references several earlier Italian masterpieces. Rocco and His Brothers for one, Paisa for another. I love the way this film strips away the glamour which characterizes Hollywood gangster films to reveal the degraded, degenerate and putrid reality of the criminal world. The people most affected by crime are those at the bottom living on sink estates like the one depicted, with an ineffectual police content to contain the situation in the ghettos. There's a really telling scene where a young graduate, drawn in to a criminal conspiracy of illegal disposal of toxic waste, decides hes had enough. His boss tells him to dump a box of peaches grown on toxic land, 'can t you smell them' ... the way the fruit contrasts with the shiny, flashy big SUV this guy drives. Our knowledge as the audience of what hes been up to, signing off a container of toxic waste to the African captain of a container ship as 'humanitarian aid...' This sort of symbolism elevates the film to the level of the great Italian masterpieces of cinema. Peaches, fruit, food is such a staple of Italian culture. Perfect looking peaches which are grown on toxic land become a metaphor for Italy itself. The measured pace certainly wont be for everyone, five people walked out the multiplex where I watched it. This is the thinking persons gangster movie. You need to work at it. The violence is shocking for its matter of factness whats most disturbing is how human life and dignity have become utterly ... I dunno I m searching for words here. Trivial? Trivial isn't the right word. Its more complete and utter degradation. Human life here has lost all dignity. When someones killed its in almost documentary fashion. Conventions of the gangster genre are discarded instead its shocking in its suddenness and sheer banality. Two obese, sweaty men in bermuda shorts despatch a pair of coked up boys whove been making a nuisance of themselves. Human life here has no value and for me this masterpiece of cinema articulates my belief we are at the beginning of the end of Western civilisation. Appropriate coming from the country which gave us Michelangelo, Caravaggio, and Silvio Berlusconi..."
Gran Torino             ,bill2594,0,drama,2008,10,"I saw the film and it was unbelievable. Clint Eastwood will have you laughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same time breaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear, and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from people crying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwood really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again! 6"
Igor             ,ccthemovieman-1,0,animation,2009,9,"I don't know why this movie doesn't get more positive recognition; I thought it was terrific, and I've seen most the feature-length animated films of the past several years. This holds it own against most of them.For an animated film, it has exactly what you want: fantastic colors and colorful characters -most of them very funny and entertaining to view and hear - and a good story with some interesting twists to it. The artwork in this film is just amazing, especially on Blu-Ray. (I've discovered that's how to watch these new animated movies - in high-def, because most of them look awesome. This film certainly is no exception.) There were many times I just wanted the freeze-frame the picture and take in all the wild artwork. I might do that on a second viewing.Also no surprise is Steve Buscemi, who always gets humorous roles in these animated films and makes everyone laugh. He usually plays a rat, too. I mentioned that to a friend and he said, ""That's because he looks like one in real life."" I wouldn't go that far, but I understand where he's coming from.Actually, all the leading voices - Buscemi, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Sean Hayes, John Cleese, Jay Leno and more were all great. I'll give a special nod to the voice that cracked me up more than all the others, the one of ""Hedi,"" done by Jennifer Coolidge. She was hilarious! If you enjoy the famous Frankstein monster story, or wild characters in a monster-lab-type setting, you should enjoy this parody. It's an underrated film and looks super on DVD."
Flash of Genius             ,manny-97,0,misc,2008,7,"The issue of ethics is front and center in ""Flash of Genius,"" a film about one man who sacrifices everything for his principles. Based on real-life events, the movie is a strong morality play grounded by the performance of Greg Kinnear.Kinnear stars as inventor Robert Kearns, a passionate thinker, a loving husband and father, and a dedicated university professor. Aided by his wife, Phyllis (Lauren Graham from the TV show ""Gilmore Girls"") and their six kids, Kearns invents the intermittent windshield wiper <U+0096> a device that would eventually be used by every car in the world.Helping Kearns in his patent application is family friend Gil Previck (Dermot Mulroney). They develop the revolutionary product and market it to Ford Motor Company. The automotive giant embraces Kearns' invention at first, but unceremoniously takes his creation and rejects the man behind it.Now, the stage is set for a David vs. Goliath story that will take decades before finding resolution. Kearns, who's been ignored and threatened by Ford, seeks counsel from attorney Gregory Lawson (the scene-stealing Alan Alda). Lawson is able to get some compensation for Kearns, but our fierce inventor does not want money <U+0096> he wants Ford to apologize for his family's sufferings.Veteran producer Mark Abraham (""Air Force One,"" ""Thirteen Days"") tries his hands at directing for the first time. When I interviewed him and asked about his career change, Abraham said, ""I've always wanted to direct this David and Goliath story since I heard about it years ago."" Based on the New Yorker article by John Seabrook, ""Flash of Genius"" is ably directed. The film flows and does not drag on, which I find very surprising because most biopic have tendencies to heighten the melodrama quotient of their real-life subjects.That doesn't mean that screenwriter Philip Railsback (""The Stars Fell on Henrietta"") avoided feel-good clichés. There are some moments, especially the family scenes, where you feel the script is trying mightily hard to tug at your heartstrings.Kinnear succeeds in injecting humanity to the character. You may not agree with Kearns and his principles, but you will certainly share his triumph when he brings Goliath to his knees.""I was attracted by the character,"" Kinnear says about his motivation for playing Kearns. ""He's not heroic like other man against corporation movies; he struck me as a very human guy."" That human guy and his well-told fight against the big machine are the reasons why I'm recommending this movie. You may wince at the idea of a film about the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper, but you will stand up and cheer when his principles are finally honored. And for that, ""Flash of Genius"" gets 3 Genius Kiss"
The Reader             ,Chris Knipp,1,drama,2008,7,"This isn't meet-cute. Fifteen-year-old schoolboy Michael Berg (David Kross) first encounters his 36-year-old future lover Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) by throwing up in her doorway. It's a dismal rainy day in a German city in 1958 and he has taken ill on the way home from school. She cleans him up and accompanies him to his family. He turns out to have scarlet fever, and is kept at home for months. Once he's well again he goes back carrying a bunch of flowers to thank Hanna for her kindness, but realizes he's turned on, and bolts in embarrassment while she's bathing. Eventually Michael returns and happily loses his virginity. A regular ritual of reading, bathing, and lovemaking develops between him and Hanna. He reads to her; she bathes him; the sex is mutual. She is a tram conductor with a harsh manner, and several huge secrets. She seems to be using Michael, but she's also enjoying him mightily, and he is reaping enormous rewards, though his affair puts pressure on his relations with family and schoolmates.Bernhard Schlink's original The Reader was an international bestseller. A lawyer and judge who writes, Schlink departed from his usual detective stories with this novel that becomes a meditation on Nazism--the denial of the surviving participants and the incomprehension of Germans like Michael who were born in the aftermath. Michael's feelings toward Hanna become much more complicated than simply those of a youth introduced to love by an older woman--as complicated as the feelings of Germans about the demons in their modern past. As for Hanna, she seems to understand nothing and to be more concerned about how she appears than what she has done.The book is in three parts. First there is the love affair of the schoolboy and the tram conductor, which ends abruptly and painfully when Hanna suddenly disappears. In the second part it's eight years later and Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with fellow students and their seminar teacher, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz). One day the young man is horrified and riveted to learn one of the defendants is none other than his long lost Hanna. She turns out to have been an SS guard at a satellite of Auschwitz and she's on trial with five other women for allegedly allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church. This trial paralyzes Michael. He has never gotten over his first, interrupted love idyll with Hanna. Now he is filled with guilt for having loved her but also a sense that he should help her when he realizes he has information that might lower her sentence.The last part, thirty years later, consists of several brief visits by Michael, first to Hanna in prison, then to the posh Manhattan flat of a Jewish woman, Rose Mather (Lena Olin), who was at the trial. She was one of the survivors and wrote a book about her experiences that was used in evidence. This provides a kind of coda.Schlink's novel is neat and arresting, a page-turner that conceivably makes you think. Its Holocaust issues are cunningly intertwined with a sensuous--and rather peculiar--coming-of-age story told by a sensitive man still struggling to understand his experience and his country's. I read the book with interest, but found it a bit contrived. This together with Stephen Daldry's previous choice to film Michael Cunningham's The Hours shows a weakness on the English director's part for stories that are a little too clever and schematic.This time the screenplay by the British playwright David Hare does damage to the book by altering its chronology, chopping it up and muddling the original linear three-part structure. Hare has said in interviews that the interpolated device of Michael's telling his story to his grown daughter was necessary to make sense of his voice-over. (That,however, is debatable.) Having settled on this device, Hare felt obligated to keep interjecting the mature Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes, at points throughout the film. The omnipresence of Fiennes' glum face undermines the sense of the young Michael's eagerness and, later, shock and confusion.Fiennes as Michael revisits a cosmetically aged Kate Winslet as Hanna three decades later when she is about to be released from prison. Michael could never bring himself to visit her, but sent her tapes of himself reading the same books he read to her during their affair. Fiennes is a cold fish, hard to relate to the lively and sweet personality of young David Kross.The film is hampered from the outset by its use of the outmoded artifice of dramatizing a story that takes place in another country and another language and yet having everyone speak English, with several of the main characters played by Brits (Winslet, Fiennes) putting on German accents. Bruno Ganz speaks with less of a German accent than they do.There is much of interest in this glossy production, beautifully photographed on location by two of the best DP's in the business, Chris Menges and Roger Deakins. Ganz's professor is an ambiguous, subtle characterization. But since the drama of the unfolding story has been destroyed by breaking it up into pieces, the only thing that remains alive and beautiful and strange are the love scenes between Kross and Winslet. There is good chemistry between the 18-year-old Kross and the 34-year-old Winslet, and their nude scenes are bold and intimate. It's only when the machinery of what Schlink and the filmmakers are trying to tell us about German guilt and denial goes into action that things begin to be clunky and cold. Unfortunately, that is a big part of the picture. "

The Reader             ,rishi_is_here,1,drama,2009,10,"The most heart rendering, touching, disturbing and yet immensely beautiful movie of the year. I can not remember when last time I was so much moved by a film. Only another movie coming in mind called Monster's Balls. I don't know why I am comparing these two movies, apparently nothing similar but perhaps somewhere vast intrigues of human mind and its dilemmas, the complexity and overall hands of destiny bring the character of Halle Berry with Kate Winslet and Billy Bob Thornton with Ralph Fiennes.The human pride has collapsed dynasties in histories. The Reader takes you to a journey of what human pride and fear of being ashamed can bring down on us, perhaps life long imprisonment to someone just to keep the secret; to someone else it perhaps brings rotting in the agony of repent and living a life worse than death. This movie poses many glitches of relationships. Accepting love as of any situation is the key, listening to heart and be bold in love is another. Why did young Michael could not meet Kate during trial? Why didn't he save her? Was it his own fear of exposing an apparently socially unaccepted affair or was it the respect towards his once lover's secret what he bore although his later life. Can someone just be convicted of guilt even the then law and order compelled her to do the job? When Hannah asked the judge ""what would you have done if your were in my place?"" not only makes him and the juries to silence but also brings the question before us, what would we have done if we were born during Nazi regime and sent to camps as guards? Could there be a choice? What will be her alternative? So many questions...I was dumbfounded with numerous questions of our social structures and be-wilderness of human natures. And overall sometimes people think they can find their ways in lives but never tries to understand what their hearts want. Is it his weak nature or is it moral dilemma to protect somebody who is convicted of felony? But then who is responsible I am sure when you watch this movie you will face similar questions. If Kate Winslet doesn't win Oscar for this role then it will be injustice to this beautiful actress who portrays her character with so much subtleties and nuances that I have seen rare in recent past. Same applies to the character of young Michael by David Kross and nonparallel Ralph Fiennes as the elder one. The expressions of this English Patient actor are marvelous. But it is no doubt a Kate Winslet movie all in all. A wonderful creation by Stephen Daldry and exceptional cinematography.I thought Slumdog was the movie of the year but then that was a loud movie. The re-fineness of the Reader is very exceptional, sets it miles apart from other movies. It is in that genre of movies that tell complexities of love and its non-confluent ends, or you keep on thinking was it not supposed to be like this. Would it be made more beautiful when at the last scene Ralph Fiennes finally opens up his closed heart to her daughter? I don't think so."

Australia             ,ptmcq05,1,adventure,2008,NA,"Shapeless epic with a shifting center. Everything feels fake even the real magnificent scenery but it's really the script that tried to be about a lot of things but ends up being about nothing. The potential poetry in the plight of the Aborigines smells of opportunism, at least, it wasn't filled with the honesty of Philip Noyce's ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" for instance. On a personal, and maybe shallow perspective, I'm truly upset about Nicole Kidman for whatever she's done to her face, I was so aware of the swelling in her upper lip that it distracted me away from any sort of emotion. Hugh Jackman is gorgeous but his acting here is so exterior that I couldn't believe him for a moment. He is the new Rock Hudson and I think he'll be at his best in bright feel good, sexy comedies. Buz Lhurman's ""Australia"" seems filmed by a foreigner. There is not a hint of the Australia I got to know and be fascinated by of the films of Peter Weir just to name one great Aussie director. Buz Lhurman has been a lucky director with lots and lots of of chutzpah. Let's see what happens next. 2"
The Ruins             ,mbworm,,adventure,2008,9,"For some reason I can't see that people who have read the novel by Scott Smith will enjoy this adaptation as much as those who have not, but nonetheless all will find this horror thriller extremely satisfying, especially gore lovers.Amy, Jeff, Stacy and Eric (Jena Malone, Jonathan Tucker, Laura Ramsey, and Shawn Ashmore) are on vacation in Mexico, relaxing and drinking by the beach and poolside before they all go their separate ways to college. When they meet a German named Mathias who needs to visit a site of ancient ruins in the jungle to find his missing brother, the vacationers, although reluctant, decide to tag along and have some fun on their last day. Boy did they have the wrong idea.Soon after they find the foreboding hidden path deep in the jungle, they stumble upon an abandoned archaeological dig amidst an ancient pyramid covered in vegetation. The local Mayans show up and after they shoot one of the other tagalongs and force the group up the trail, keeping guard around the pyramid, it becomes clear that the vacationers are being held hostage. Fear, hunger, and insanity begin to set in as over a three day period the group's mentalities begin to diminish. One by one, they fall prey to the evil vines that reside on the ancient ruins and it slowly becomes clear that they're probably not going to make it out of Mexico alive. Does this sound stupid? Sure. Killer vines, that's laughable. But during their stay you slowly begin to realize this isn't funny at all. It's hardcore chilling, and the vines are nothing to laugh at. They're used to a terrifying effect, especially in a chilling scene when Amy and Stacey descend into the pyramid and the vines try to kill them.As far as quality, the acting is top notch, especially from Jena Malone and Laura Ramsey. Ramsey's Stacy suffers the worst physical harm and her performance is the best as she clearly goes insane when some nasty vines nestle in under her skin. All of the actors are exceptional and the audience will feel very attached. It's especially hard to watch when they start dying. These are real people in a horrifying situation. This isn't a mild horror film, it pulls no punches. It's straightforward, and although it is about killer flowers, it's as good as a horror movie can get, and the tension that director Carter Smith builds through the great pacing is unbearable. Kudos also goes to Jena Malone, who has broken free of her childhood performances and is getting into much more mature work. She is promising here.I won't spoil the outcome of the character's fates but I will say for fans of the novel that the story is twisted around somewhat. Scott Smith adapted this from his book. The same events basically happen, but he's switched up his characters and the end starts to stray further and further from his novel. That's not to say that it doesn't work, for I think that it makes the experience better, you can go in expecting some new scares even if you've read the harrowing novel. I was supremely pleased at this take on the horrifying story and I was surprised to find myself shaken when it was over, particularly during the grueling scene when Stacy cuts into herself repeatedly with a hunting knife to pull out vines. This is one of the most unsettling scenes depicted in a horror film recently. You won't forget ""The Ruins"" and it's one of the best horror movies in a long time."
Ponyo             ,eva_luke2003,1,animation,2008,8,"I have recently watched this film, and have decided to comment on it. the best way to watch this film is to not expect what you have seen in the past by Miyazaki. Miyazaki is well known for his work on on Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. well for western viewers anyway. both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different. However Ponyo is a whole different type of story and animation all together. The story follows ""Ponyo"" a fish that has the face a girl. After Ponyo runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea, she find a whole new world she never knew was out there, and new trouble as well, when she almost caught by a fishing boat, she was rescued by a five year old boy known as Sousuke. the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever ? I feel the movie was inspired by ""The little mermaid"" and at the same time similar to ""Tonari no Totoro"" the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the Characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them? the film is set over about what seems to be 3 days, I think this is why the movie is so short. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you all enjoy this movie as well"
Yes Man             ,J_Trex,0,comedy,2008,7,"After seeing ""The Number 23"" I was beginning to wonder if Jim Carrey had renounced his trademark physical comedy roles he played to such great effect in ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Liar, Liar"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", etc.Carrey is back in form with ""Yes Man"". While the plot was lacking and somewhat formulaic, it was fun to watch the best physical comedy talent of our generation doing what he does best for two hours. Zooey Deschanel was good as the love interest (and she did a nice job singing to).If you liked Carrey's earlier works, you'll find plenty to like in this movie. I hope Carrey keeps on doing these comedies. It's what he was born to do."
Summer Hours             ,hdare,1,drama,2008,2,"This film has little, if any, merit. I do not think it was the film maker's intention, but it turns out to provide a strong case for the abolition of a whole class in society, namely the bourgeoisie. I guess in that case you could argue that it serves a useful purpose.The only character to elicit any sympathy is the housekeeper Eloise, whose part is regrettably small. The rest of the characters are two dimensional and not even Frederic, played by Charles Berling and the nearest any actor comes to a protagonist, is given much depth.I hesitated before ticking the 'contains spoiler' box as there is virtually no plot to spoil. There is no dramatic tension and no interesting contrasts or tensions between the actors, despite generational and career differences, and the fact that Frederic, an economist based in Paris, finds himself in a minority regarding his mother's estate, is fairly easy to anticipate. The only reason you would want to meet any member of this family is to steal one of their valuable objets d'art.The direction and photography are plodding. Art would appear to be central concern of the film maker but the cinematography is so poor that for instance we never get to properly see the two paintings by Corot or fully appreciate the other art objects and pieces of furniture that end up in the Musee d'Orsay.There is no interesting philosophical case, within the dialogue or otherwise, for works of art being displayed in museums or kept at home or sold at auction despite these matters being the main subject of the dialogue during much of the film. There is actually something rather dead and depressing about the whole movie even the children are feckless, and maybe that is the director's intention. I left the cinema feeling I had been neither entertained, nor my mind stimulated.I hope that this dull film is not representative of current French cinema. Don't waste your time or money watching it."
Yes Man             ,michael11391,0,comedy,2008,10,"I saw a free screening of this hilarious movie in my hometown and it was MAGNIFICENT!!! It starts off fast and never slows down (never a dull moment in the movie) and for fans of Jim Carrey (like me) who wants him to be himself, prepare to laugh so extremely hard that will have your sides in excruciating pain from all the laughter you made!! Jim Carrey was at his very best & he made me laugh non-stop till' the end of the movie but it was not a one-man show, the supporting cast threw in some fantastic delivery lines, humor & craziness. Zooey Deschanel was surprisingly very funny (didn't know she could be THIS funny), Bradley Cooper was funny, Terence Stamp did great as well but out of all of the supporting cast, there are two of them that had some of the funniest scenes in movie history: Rhys Darby plays the memorable and hilarious boss of Carl Allen (Carrey), he had some classic and unbelievable delivery lines in the movie that were just funny. And the other person: Fionnula Flanaghan who plays the nasty, sexually & very funny neighbor of Carl Allen and delivers us one of the most disgusting & very funny scenes in years (not giving you spoilers)!! Yes Man is not only a very, very funny but it sends a good message about how do you want to handle your life."
The Dark Knight             ,rodigon7,0,action,2008,7,"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks... 3"
The Express             ,boahook,,misc,2008,10,I love how people are always looking for some underlying reason to tell the story other than expressing history and an American hero. This movie has been in the works far longer than the Obama campaign and it is insulting to think it is created to sway people to vote for a black president based on white guilt.Those of you who are interested in the Ernie Davis Story should watch it and enjoy it if you like it and if you're a fan but those of you who feel you and the rest of white American are too stupid to make you're own political decisions without being manipulated with guilt into choosing a candidate should of course not watch ANY media until the election is over.
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,sphouch,,animation,2008,NA,"This movie is not likely to win (or be nominated for) any awards. But that does not change the fact that it was an amusing distraction for the children. It seemed to be a variation of Galaxy Quest, which was a fun movie itself. This, of course, was more kid-oriented, and my three children (ages 3, 6, and 9) all enjoyed the show - the 9 year old enjoyed it in spite of himself.It was a cute movie with a positive message that used humor to advance the story as opposed to a movie that makes up a story to move from pratfall to pratfall. It's a rare treat in movie-making these days, and one that is worth checking out - at a matinée"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,lual,1,misc,2008,6,"Once every few years, Bernd Eichinger feels the need to prove to everybody that he has the biggest dick in the German film industry. In order to do this, he refrains from making cheap stupid international movies like ""Resident Evil"" and dumb German comedies and makes a big movie that he calls important. After ""Der Untergang"" and ""Das Parfum"" we now get ""Der Baader-Meinhof Komplex"".One really wonders who this movie was made for. People who don't know anything about the RAF will not understand most of what is going on. People who know some stuff about this will only find the things that they already know and experts on the topic will be horrified about the simplifications and elisions.The movie looks great, as it should be expected. It really looks like it is from the era. All technical aspects are wonderful, the cinematography, the action, sound, effects. And the actors do an incredible job. Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek stand out in this universally good cast as Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin.Also, to be fair, it has to be said, that the beginning of the movie is really gripping and well done. The viewer gets to understand a lot about the feeling of the time and the intentions of the protagonists are well-explained.But the whole thing goes downhill after a while. By the time Ulrike Meinhof joins the group and Andreas Baader breaks out of prison, we lose focus. Suddenly there are new members in almost every scene and none of them gets introduced properly (with the exception of Peter-Jürgen Boock). Certainly, not every character needs a back story, but it would have been essential to tell the audience at least how these recruits got to join the group in general.By the time that Meinhof, Baader and Ensslin are imprisoned, we really don't care about the RAF any more. And this is mainly because we have no idea who these ""2nd generation"" people are. Even people who know about the RAF will wonder who this or that guy in each scene is supposed to be because only few of them are even mentioned by name. The assassinations of von Mirbach, Buback and Ponto are just checked off a list to get the story to completion. And the whole Schleyer-kidnapping as well as the attack on the ""Landshut"" which are supposed to serve as the climax of the movie have terrible timing and leave out so much important information.But also the handling of characters of the ""1st generation"" is done poorly in parts. Raspe is basically absent from the movie until he gets taken in by the police, same with Meins, whose only purpose in the movie it is to get captured, force-fed and then die. Only these three scenes. Nothing more is seen of him! Neither Eichinger nor Edel really cared to explain or teach anything. The whole thing was just planned as a big production to show off 2/3 of the more well-known actors working in Germany in one movie. Even the guy who attempts to assassinate Rudi Dutschke gets played by a well known actor (Tom Schilling). What this movie would have needed is the kind of epilogue that Eichinger put at the end of ""der Untergang"" to show what happened to some characters and also to even explain who these characters were supposed to be.So, we only have one more chance to find out. Since the movie is filled with well-known actors, reading the credits might help. No chance here. Except for the main characters no character name is mentioned in the credits, only the actors who showed up. To me, this is the ultimate proof that Eichinger didn't care about the characters at all, all he cared about was the actors he could squish into this movie.There are other things that others will criticize, for example the way the victims are turned just into cardboard figures with no purpose other than getting assassinated, or the fact that the German government, which was very involved especially in the final act, is not present at all. I personally do not mind these things too much, because I understand that this is not the story the makers wanted to tell.I only criticize the movie for what it is. A nice-looking, but unfortunately very hollow and confusing piece of work. Too bad. It was a great chance that was missed here. 1"
La siciliana ribelle             ,GeneralUrsus,1,crime,2011,NA,"This mafia revenge story might have been a good film but, a weak script and some horrendous acting render it with the kiss of death. As a child young Rita witnesses her father's cold blooded murder at the hands of a rival mafia clan. Years later in an attempt to bring justice she seeks the assistance of the district prosecutor and is placed in a witness protection program in Rome.While strolling the Colosseum she feels she is being followed. Moments later she encounters the stranger and shortly after is calmly chatting with him soon they are dating. It is mindless and ridiculous instances like this that completely undermine any credibility in this tale. Her life has been threatened but, somehow it's okay to strike up a budding romance with some guy in Rome.Much later Rita is placing phone calls home from her Rome apartment not terrific thinking if you value your life and your enemies can easily be tapping the lines. Aside from many flaws within the story the biggest fault with this film was the casting of Veronica D'Agostino in the title role.Ms. D'Agostino is an acting neophyte and it shows with every over the top glare and pained expression she delivers. In her attempt to appear indignant her face contorts in such odd fashions she looks somewhere between constipated and deranged, or both. She is capable of one note throughout the entire film, anger. In fact you get the feeling that the love interest she encounters in Rome was probably created to develop another more uplifting shade to her on screen demeanor.A good actress would hold the picture together and elevate the weak material by giving the viewer someone to care about. The Sicilian Girl suffers from wretched acting, poor writing and should be swimming with the fishes and not in your cue"
Kung Fu Panda             ,jacob-noergaard,0,animation,2008,9,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.Boy, was I ever under-expecting.At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clichés, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point. 1"
Untraceable             ,blanbrn,1,crime,2008,7,"With the internet and cyberspace so common in everyone's life today, plus with the reported upswing of crimes like identity theft and pornography on the net in it's own way ""Untraceable"" is very relevant and common with today's times. ""Untraceable"" a crime computer thriller that's set in Portland, Oregon it involves an investigative computer unit of the FBI headed up by a single mother Jennifer Marsh(Diane Lane). Interestlingly the unit comes across a website of a creep who broadcasts live torture and killings of hostage victims in various grisly ways live over the internet. The bloody catch is the more the web surfer logs onto the sick website, the faster and quicker the victims will die in the various forms of bleed outs, fried by hot mirrors, or seasoned by sulfuric acid. The drama only gets more interesting when the computer of Jennifer is hacked into by the sicko setting up for a dramatic finish and showdown encounter. Lane gives a fine performance as a serious investigative agent, and yet no matter how grisly that many scenes are the theme of net crime and hacking overpowers and gives a strong message of awareness even over the well liked and popcorn moments of torture and nasty horror. Overall ""Untraceable"" is not a bad flick nothing great, yet it's enjoyable and does hold interest by making us aware of the web crime and hacking identity problem."

Prom Night             ,Scarecrow-88,1,horror,2008,4,"Standard slasher fare(..the kind ""Scream"" was poking fun at)has a psycho(Johnathon Schaech, effectively cast), a teacher so obsessed with his student Donna(Brittany Snow)that we see him murder her entire family in an attempt to have the teenager all to himself, escaping from his holding cell in a sanitarium & invading the poor traumatized girl's prom night(..quite a lavish affair, held in a prestigious hotel)murdering her friends throughout the night. He has taken a master key from a maid he kills and sneaks into the room of Donna's pals, football star Ronnie(Collins Pennie)and girlfriend Lisa(Dana Davis), slicing and stabbing various victims who find themselves alone with him, attacking them from behind with his pocket knife. The film follows Detective Winn(Idris Elba)and his men as they canvas the hotel, trying quietly to handle the situation which will eventually spiral out of control. The climax will show the obvious eventual confrontation between the unemotional, remorseless homicidal maniac and his devoted goal, Donna at her home, in the bedroom.One might wonder why I'd give away the conclusion, but honestly this slasher follows the rules of the genre to the very letter, sore afraid of taking any interesting or original routes. Most of the stabbings(..all of them, actually)appear off-screen with the camera displaying the horrified expressions on victim's faces as they are getting the knife plunged into their stomachs..you also hear the sound of the knife as it drives into the victim repeatedly(..probably the sound-effects guy stabbing a melon). A major visual stamp for the movie shows the killer unfolding his pocket knife right before he sticks into his victims. We do get two scenes where he slices the throats of victims with blood either squirting or splattering, but the actual contact of metal to flesh is cleverly disguised with the camera appropriately placed. The film silhouettes the killer and he often springs from the dark like Michael Myers, such as a hotel closet(..this technique is used multiple times by the director)as victims open the door not knowing what awaited them. There are a lot of scenes where folks pop up scaring the daylights out of Donna..the kind of jump-scare technique(..with cued jump music)that grows tiresome really fast. While I though Schaech was appropriately creepy, he's merely a walking menace of the Michael Myers variety, a robot killing anyone in his path. The way the film produces the first confrontation between the killer and Donna in the hotel is rather contrived. And, the killer's escape from the hotel is rather preposterous. But, the screenplay of a slasher is supposed to have that final sequence where the killer and his muse finally meet and a score is settled, and this movie's is really an uninspired, ""seen-it-all-before"" kind of experience. What's sad is this is probably superior to the original(..which, to be honest, isn't similar to in any way). The film is professionally made, well produced, but an empty hollow shell of a slasher film, devoid of anything remarkable or satisfying. In other words, it's just right for the teen target audience it's meant for. How the killer is able to move about bodies, keeping everything quiet, with no blood getting on his clothes as he thrusts his blade into torsos repeatedly, is anybody's gues"

Saw V             ,Bleam66,0,crime,2008,4,"Like everyone else, I was expecting this movie to live up to the hype and be absolutely horrible. Since though I have seen SAW I-IV, I had to go see this at the midnight showing. What started it off, I was already impressed with that I saw. As the movie was going forward it was hard to tell how it would all add up. By the end though I was expecting to be disappointed and it really did not.While SAW fans will appreciate this, it really depends on what you like. If you are expecting a SAW II - III where it is mainly gore and such, maybe not so much. If you are like the few who want to know more about the story, then it is a must to see this.Now while every question is not answered, it makes up for it in its own ways. Do not be like me or most of the people who were hesitant to see this film due to people not enjoying it. I think many people would be surprised on just how great this film really is. To me, it was the best since the first one, despite the weak twist and sometimes cheesy kills. Then again, name a film that has been perfect because everyone has a fault. 1"
Twilight             ,socact-1,1,misc,2008,7,"To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I'm in my 20s...).I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward's story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn't care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can't expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about ""major things"" missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn't notice any major omissions.Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson's performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke's fault or Pattinson's acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie.The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it's a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn't existed.Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I'm hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie.Overall, I enjoyed ""Twilight"" for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can't have (and despite Meyer's Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there. 4"
Igor             ,verandii,0,animation,2008,8,"Let's clear something out of the way right now : Igor is an animation movie, but mainly not for children. Kids will not understand most of the jokes as the topic for most of them are intended for an older audience. There is, however, a visual comedy that will apply to younger viewers, but overall I think this movie targeted teenagers and adults.People will like Igor based on what they expect from the movie. If they expect it to be like Wall-E and other Pixar movies, you probably will be disappointed. Igor has it's good sides and bad sides. The visual side was breathtaking, the setting is beautiful, with unorthodox character design. However in some cases, like the king of malaria, it seemed like a copy of Nightmare Before Christmas' mayor, and that was disappointing. The story is not too bad, but not the best. It lacked a bit of depth at some times, but it is still amusing and entertaining.Overall Igor is a good animation movie. It's not the best, definitely not the worst. It's definitely worth seeing for animation fans, people who like Tim Burton's work (as the design in the movie is similar to his style), and anyone who wants to enjoy a light story with a happy ending."

Her vacant stares are anything but vacant and will haunt you long after you have left the theater. The subject matter is much more than just an affair with an older woman, albeit this love affair impacts the young man throughout his life. It is more a morality play and a philosophical question of German guilt.Bruno Ganz, who plays the professor, actually includes Karl Jaspers' The Question of German Guilt as required reading for his young law students, including Michael Berg, Hanna's lover. The professor also requires his young law students to attend a trial for low level guards from the concentration camps.While watching the trial scenes, I tried to make a decision as to what I would have done if I were in Berg's position. It is not an easy question. I guarantee you will be torn apart by this film.The young Michael Berg, David Kross, gives a stunning performance. And Ralph Fiennes, as usual, gives the performance he should, reserved, yet multi-layered if you look deep into the philosophical questions this film poses.It is based on a book by Bernhard Schlick, adapted for the screen by David Hare, and directed by Stephen Daltry. I highly recommend this film.One last thing, on a personal note, I fell in love with Bruno Ganz in the Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire and I am still in love with that man. So sexy."
The Dark Knight             ,pbertovich05,0,action,2008,8,"This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didn't feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very cliché way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn't as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set. 1"
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,abisio,1,misc,2009,9,"For those like me, who lived and recall the sixties, the seventies and the eighties the term terrorism is not such an evil word as it is for people who only associate it with September 11, 2001.Terrorism was the fight of a minority group against a government. As minorities group do not have an official army (and obviously far less resources than the government), they attack isolated sites by surprise creating chaos, terror and media attention. This is the way to show their discontent and enlist new members (and resources).As bad as it sounds, if you remember your history lessons, the people that in 18 century throw away tea bags from British ships (the Boston Tea Party) and later the rebels that fight to free this country from the British government were also terrorist. All independence wars in America South to North were basically terrorist groups fighting European Crowns exploiting them.Based on the above, understanding ""The Baader-Meinhof complex"" requires an open mind probably even more than the director had.In sixties, Germany two main parties united under an extreme right position; outlawing the communist and left parties and creating a conservative state, affiliated with USA capitalism.Former NAZI members like Kurt Georg Kiesinger controlled the coalition and government positions and opposed public opinions, specially those intellectual group as students.Some violent events executed by the government against students and protesters created the ground for a violent revolutionary movement called RAF.Originally staged by Andreas Baader and his girlfriend Gudrun Ensslin; and later, molded, organized and ideologically improved by the left wing reporter Ulrike Meinhoff, RAF become a popular movement and the main resistant against a totalitarian government that even supported genocide like the Vietnam War.The first part of the movie, makes a fast depiction of the events using news footage or staging events like the Iraq's Sha protest while introducing the main characters and the subsequent born off the RAF (Red Army Faction).While Meinhoff and Ensslin are properly described as an obsessive idealist and a violent but smart executor, Baader is merely shown as a violent and impulsive guy; not particularly brilliant or brave (Baader was incredible charismatic thus he was the face of the movement).The second parts of the movie, basically shows a series of acts and events performed by RAF shown as criminals masking as political activists and far from organized.From that moment on, as the events become more and more interesting; the movie (or the director) never takes the side of the activist (which might be right) but seems to approve the government behavior (police never start shooting and rarely hit them); the absurd courtroom events (based on transcripts) or the acceptance of the dead of many main RAF members as suicide (seems pretty convenient in the most heavily guarded prison in Germany, all were able to obtain guns and bullets, not to escape but to kill themselves).Please do not take me wrong. The movie is technically perfect; the direction and acting is mostly outstanding and the events are impossible to look away; but this type of political movie, should be neutral ; not something Uli Edel did in my opinion.In any case, it is really worth seeing it, to learn some history and understanding that fighting is sometimes necessary but violence is not the solution."
Death Race             ,knapp1991,0,action,2008,7,"I just saw this film last night at a premier in Portland Oregon.Im not gonna give away any of the story because there isn't much of one which is fine in this case. Explolsions and murder and hot women plus Jason statham equals good movie. I went into this film expecting it to be disaster,and i say this only because I'm anonymous... it was good. Plenty of wow moments to cringe at and not just me but the whole audience. The driving does get a little repetitive but kudos to the director Paul w.s. Anderson for mixing it up. Plus it is a revenge story which everyone loves. BOTTOM LINE if you want to be entertained and don't mind a some violence see it it is worth the price of admission. "
College Road Trip             ,randomstuff0101,1,adventure,2008,8,"There seems to be a lot of people on this board that didn't like this film. I took my niece and nephew to see this a couple day's ago they loved it and i thought it was a good movie too. And if you or your kid's are fan's of""Even Stevens""- Margo Harshman ""That's so Raven""-Raven Symone ""The Suite life of Zack and Cody""-Brenda Song or ""High School Musical"" Lucas Garbeel Then more then likely you'll love this movie too!!and for any Margo Harshman fan's reading this post Margo is going to have at least 3 more movie's released this year a horror called ""From Within"" a drama called ""Legacy"" and a comedy called ""Extreme Movie"" unfortunately she only had a few scenes in College Road Trip but it was still a pretty good movie and she's going to have a larger role in From Within so can't wait to see it!"
Trucker             ,juneebuggy,1,drama,2015,NA,"Great acting all around in this gritty indie drama, but especially from Michelle Monaghan who does a fantastic job as Diane Ford, a self-reliant trucker who is forced to give up her carefree lifestyle (of drunken one night stands) and take on the responsibility of caring for her 11-year-old son when his father ends up in the hospital.You really want her character to succeed here which helped move the story along because the plot wasn't all that original. However in saying that I've never seen the estranged child reuniting with wayward parent done in quite this way before either.All the characters here are damaged in one way or another and the story as a whole is somewhat heartbreaking. Nathan Fillion is always a treat to watch, he is just so likable and it was nice seeing him play a different sort of role. The boy who played the son was also kind of amazing. Benjamin Bratt was a surprise in a supporting role. Ultimately this made me want to hit the road. 03."
College Road Trip             ,ssmksi,1,adventure,2008,6,"I watched this movie because I like to watch Martin Lawrence movies.This is a family movie. There is no swearing, there is no violence, etc. It's the way family movies should be. The storyline isn't the best nor is the musical score or acting however, it is not as bad as others deem it to be. I think too many people expect to be entertained by movies as if it was the first time being on a roller coaster. Those types of movies are jewels and should be praised as such however, these types of movies (college road trip) should not be condemned by seemingly heartless people who think they are experts in how movies should be. I often wonder if these people actually sit through and watch movies or just make bad comments because they don't like a particular actor. Oh well. I liked this movie."
The Express             ,JoeytheBrit,,misc,2009,NA,"Even though I knew absolutely nothing about Ernie Davis, the tragic young hero of this biopic, as I watched this film the suspicion that I was watching one of those largely fictionalised accounts that typifies the kind of biopics Hollywood churned out in its golden age kept growing with each predictable emotional peak and plot twist. A quick scan of some of the comments on the film's message board quickly confirmed those suspicions.Chronological impossibilities aside, this film could have easily been made in the 30s or 40s. Ernie Davis - and every other black character in this film - is filled with a kind of pious nobility that set them apart from most white characters in the film - apart from those insightful enough (such as gruff old coach Burgess Meredith, erm, Jon Voight - no, Samuel L. Jackson<U+0085> Gene Hackman? Dennis Quaid!) to see the boy's football talent (but not his uniqueness as an individual) . The whites in this film are blindly racist West Virginians or gung-ho jocks or wise-cracking sports reporters. Everything is black and white, you might say.The film's well-made, the acting is good (especially Rob Brown as Davis), and there's no doubting the sincerity of the writers or the source material. But by following conventional biopic story lines and blatantly distorting certain incidents and situations in order to make a 'better' film, the makers severely dilute its impact and bring into question every aspect, thus making it unreliable as a 'true story.' It might also perhaps have been wiser to finish the film after Syracuse's victory over Texas at the Rose Bowl, with titles to inform the viewer of Davis's winning of the Heisman Trophy and the illness that cruelly cut short his life, rather than continuing another half-an-hour after its emotional and inspirational pea"
Lakeview Terrace             ,bluwlf_8503,0,crime,2008,10,"Lakeview Terrace joins movies like Crash and American History X as it brings to light the sad reality that Americans still deal with unfounded racial biases and discrimination. If you thought it was boring or didn't make any sense, you didn't get the point. This isn't Death Race; it has a message and if you chose not to learn anything from it, it's a testament to your own ignorance. It should make you sit back and take a look at your own beliefs as well as, the everyday injustice of racism. It clearly illustrated that when we chose to identify ourselves and others by color, we all end up losing out. If you are not willing to be mature and open-minded about this film, skip it and go rent Die Hard or something else you don't have to think through"
Surveillance             ,thesar-2,1,crime,2009,1,"I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the ""Fat Guys At the Movies."" The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt I've ever called a movie ""stupid"" but that was the first word that came to mind about one-third in and stayed in my mind until the end.Where to begin? Unbelievable premise and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or I'll just blame both) and enormously bad acting. I'd sooner believe Bill Pullman as President of the USA than a FBI agent here. (Of course, there's a reason for that, and I'll partially go into that.) And to top it off, if you can't figure the so-called shocking ""twist"" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. Don't worry, they'll tell you the ""twist"" every five minutes thereafter.There's been some serial killer(s) on the loose in the most depressing town in the county, or world. But there's more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. Could there possibly be more? Oh, yeah, there's a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There's gotta be more to this than what I mentioned! That's what makes a movie interesting! Adding as many subplots that may/may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, then I'll continue. We have goofy FBI agents that made me laugh. A pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer OD's but then resorts to robbery. A gosh-tooting great-guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry/suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside who didn't just phone his performance in, he barely text it in.None of these work. They're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks, and believe me, you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. In addition, the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. I guess I'm referring mostly to the cops, but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was, unless his exposure has been limited to Goosebumps stories. And what's with the title? Surveillance? Oh, I get it; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film interviews. Since that's so random, it might as well been called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrid mess."
Four Christmases             ,JoeKarlosi,1,comedy,2009,5,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon are Brad and Kate ... a couple who are so happy with their relationship that they don't ever want to spoil it by getting married. Besides, both of them are children of divorce and thus they're in no hurry to tie any knots themselves. So after they've fornicated before the credits (always suitable for a Christmas movie), they decide they'll skip Christmas by going to Fiji, but give their parents some b.s. excuse every year about traveling to help orphans (""You can't spell 'families' without 'lies' "", Brad rationalizes). When it turns out all airline flights are cancelled due to fog, their problem is made worse when they're interviewed ""live"" at the airport by the news, and their families see them. So they have no choice but to make four trips in one day to visit each of their divorced parents on Christmas. All the families in the film are weird to one extent or another -- Brad's two brothers are wrestlers who beat him up mercilessly; his dad (Robert Duvall) is a redneck ol' cuss. His mom (Sissy Spacek) is now shagging her son's younger best friend. Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen) is sex-starved. Jon Voight is in there somewhere as Kate's pop. I could go on, but the point is that there's a good deal of crude and toilet-type humor on display here (a lot of babies with projectile vomiting, for example) and not that much of it is humorous. Doesn't feel very ""Christmas-y"", either. I always thought the idea of Christmas movies is to want to re-view them annually each year with the family as tradition. But why anyone would want to see the majority of ""holiday"" films of this decade over again is beyond me. ** out of ***"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,jowen-09503,,animation,2018,NA,"I've been a veggie-tales fan for as long as I can remember, but now that I'm older and I'm going back to watch a lot of my old dvd collections of veggie-tales, I realized that a lot of them aren't as good as I remembered .

I later heard that veggie-tales was no longer creating any more films or shows, in my grief, I decided to watch this film again, boy was I surprised! It was a fun and funny clever little film that felt like an auctual movie! It uses the Narnia kind of way of creating a fictional world that symbolizes the Christian faith in a ""hidden"" way while keeping the film fun and action packed. A good watch for family's and kids.

Stop-Loss             ,Erico_77375,0,drama,2008,10,"What is bravery? Is it trying to do the right thing while facing death in the process? What is patriotism? Is it selflessly giving to your country your services and possibly your life to protect and idea? What is honor? Is it following through on your responsibilities to others who depend on you? In today's United States Army, these questions aren't merely hypothetical, but the basis of character. Kimberly Pierce understood this when she made her sophomore film Stop-Loss, which is extremely likely to be my favorite film of 2008.Stop-Loss tells the story of a group of soldiers from Texas who are coming home from Iraq. Just before they see stateside, they encounter an ambush that kills three of their respected brothers. The squad leader Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) feels responsible for the deaths. He intends to leave the service for good when he gets back along with his best friend (Channing Tatum). This is good news to Brandon's family; his father (the great Cirian Hinds) was a vet from Vietnam. This is also good news for his friend's fiancé (Abbie Cornish), whose love only shadows her loneliness.But when Brandon turns in his gear and paperwork, he is told that he's to ship back out to Iraq on a stop-loss, which he instantly contests with his superior (Timothy Olyphant). The result has Brandon on the run as he goes AWOL to find a way out of going. He is aided by his friend's fiancé; he decides his best chance is to convince a local senator in Washington to help him. Along the way, he gets a tour of conscience. He meets the family of one of his dead men, whose brother knows about people who could get soldiers through to Canada. He also goes to see another of his comrades (Victor Russak), who was severely wounded in the conflict. And at the end, Brandon must make one of the hardest decisions that anyone will ever have to face.Love it or hate it, this film has be one of the most unusual films dealing with war. It neither sides for the conflict in Iraq or against it, finding the argument to be beside the point. No doubt that Brandon does say something unflattering about his Commander-in-Chief in one scene, but the film makes it's bravest decision in being pro-soldier from beginning to end. We like these guys, we honor their dedication to our country and we only want them to find happiness and safety back home. But we can tell nearly from the start that coming home isn't going to be easy when tensions flare up in unpredictable ways. One of the men (played flawlessly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seems to need violence in order to feel normal. The film doesn't hate him for it, nor do we since we know that, in the words of another great movie, he had ""a bad war"".There is something to be said about the decisions made in this film. In lesser movies, Brandon's decision would be more clear-cut depending on the filmmaker's political views. There would be some who call Brandon's plight cowardice and the film addresses this by allowing Brandon to have more than a couple of emotions. He's not afraid to fight or to die, but has a more interesting reason to resist. And the film doesn't see any easy answer in the options left to him. We see the life of another AWOL soldier up-close. There's nothing pretty about that.A lot of the success of the film has to go to the amazing casting of the film. I have never been much of a fan for Ryan Phillippe), but he might have just converted me. This is an amazing performance of such complexity and earnestness that I was left truly amazed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been a rising independent superstar, completely washing away his child actor days in films that are challenging, playing parts that require his brand of smooth ferocity. This character is important even though he does little for the plot by being a tragic figure. I believe he might see his first nomination for this role. But my favorite performance may also be the most worthy of the Oscar this year: Abbie Cornish. Cornish isn't just throwing diamonds as a young woman in love with an impossible man. Stop-Loss might just be the best military film since Platoon that deals with soldiers as individuals and not part of a strategy board. Kimberly Pierce, whose first and only other film was Boys Don't Cry, sees soldiers in a way that other filmmakers haven't (and those filmmakers are almost exclusively male, a few veterans themselves). She declares that she had documented hundreds of interviews with soldiers. This is one of the extremely rare cases that fiction proves to be the better format over documentary. In making this a fictional tale, she can tell a broader story and accompany the emotional journey of all her characters. She did this with her first film, which told the sad story of Brandon Teena. I didn't think that she could have made a better film than that. She has proved that she could and has.All in all, I love this film and cannot recommend this to enough people. It's going to be attacked unfairly by the pro-war crowd who either feel that the film encourages wrong behaviors or weakening morale. In fact, I think that the film shows the real indomitable spirit of the fighting men with honor. But I also find that those who attack movies like these usually think that the best way to support the troops is to keep them in harms way. Stop-Loss isn't a cry to ""cut and run"". It's a testament that soldiers will remain honorable no matter how they come home. Something that John McCain might keep in mind 1"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,jowan-carbin,0,drama,2011,10,"In recent years, Hollywood has been consumed with big budget comic book action spectacles that present a healthy dose of the implausible, and if you're lucky, at least a small amount of the nuances found in the human experience. The problem is, that those nuances are mostly seen through the eyes of CGI artists. In the family drama FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN, the nuances are seen through the eyes of writer/director Dennis Lee, a courageous new artist who treats his audience as if they have the two pivotal ingredients needed to enjoy his film, patience, and a brain. FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN is not your mother's family drama, dripping with sentimentality and moments of levity so overblown they border on caricature. FIREFLIES is an illumination of a family dynamic so subtly perverse at times, that you soon realize that the Taylor Family is not just your neighbors but in one-way or another a representation of some aspect of yourself. This makes for unsettling and emotionally rewarding cinema. And by the end of writer/director Dennis Lee's beautifully realized film, FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN, we've left the Taylor Clan in a place that may not be enough of an astronomical shift for the comic book movie crowd, or even some critics, but a place of authenticity and simplicity that speaks volumes"
Kung Fu Panda             ,pvd007,0,animation,2008,8,"After the disappointing SHREK 3 and the only ""cute"" OVER THE HEDGE, DreamWorks Animation finally delivers another highlight to the CGI animated universe.I got used to the rather simple story of MADAGASCAR after watching it again, I really liked SHREK and even more SHREK 2 (am I the only one?). I never liked the cultural references they built in, because I think they only work in their time (but in their time they worked great!). So for me KUNG FU PANDA is the first great ""classic"" DWA film. Go see it, it also works for adults. If you have seen some of the classic martial arts film (Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee etc) you will even more enjoy it. The voice talent of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane is perfectly used. The other voices are OK.It will be a big hit for DWA, north of 200 millions domestic, eventually even 300 mil.That said, my favorite CGI's are 1. THE INCREDIBLES, 2. RATATOUILLE and 3. FINDING NEMO and closely followed by KUNG FU PANDA. Looking forward to seeing KFP an second time and then maybe it will become my new Nr. 3. 1"
Saw V             ,silentcheesedude,0,crime,2008,7,"After so many sequels, one should expect a series to be driven to the ground. Although it's getting a bit tiring, Saw fans, & for that matter, fans of gore, shouldn't be disappointed with the fifth movie. Saw 5 still follows the same routine of the cat and mouse game... but of course, as always, telling you too much of the plot is a ruining the game for you. Let's keep it at the thin plot description already given: a detective goes out of his way to make sure that his secret is kept, before an agent uncovers his identity. The subplot involves 5 individuals who are somehow connected, and must work their way out of traps.The traps still prove to be especially cruel, perhaps a little too cruel, but even that is worked into the story. It involves quite a bit of the past, much like Saw 4, it will give you more of the origin of the characters, whether it's needed or not. Minimizing flashbacks, it instead will fill in a number of plot and character holes.This is David Hackl's directional debut. Considering he's been around since Saw 2 as production designer, this is a solid step forward. There's no doubt that these somehow ingenious, if not over the top story lines that interconnect were made up well after the fact, but that doesn't change the fact that the scriptwriters were keen on at least making an effort to do exactly that. Tie things in, making the package look neater, & hoping you don't think about it too much that you start to see the implausibility of it all.If you have not seen the previous Saw's, you will be lost here, as you will be left with confusing tie in's and past incidents that mesh too well with the present. It's just not kind to new viewers.All in all, I can't complain about Saw 5, because I got exactly what I expected. Clever, deadly traps, uncomfortable situations, & of course, the ""twist"" at the end. There's no denying that one particular actor that's been in all the Saw's is especially good at what he does.For the most part, I would suggest waiting for a rental. I think that some viewers may grow tired of the series because it comes out every year. The nature of an audience viewing sequels is that it dwindles in number over time, as ""sequelitis"" sets in. But if you enjoyed the previous Saws & all their abusive, bloody, cruel, & heartless drama, you don't need me to suggest anything to you."
The Strangers             ,Wolf30x,,horror,2008,8,"The Strangers is a movie that delivers everything it promises it would. It scares you. Simple as that. Instead of relying on buckets of gore and an over-contrived premise, it keeps things simple and thats what makes it work. For an hour and a half, the viewer is subjected to a slowly mounting sense of dread that just keeps building without ever pulling back. The story never falls victim to the usual horror movie clichés, but at the same time , it doesn't make any ridiculous attempts to go against them. Perhaps the best thing that the movie has going for it is it's believability. There isn't really any thing to distract the viewer from buying into the premise wholeheartedly. Considering that this is the director's first ever movie, it's a feat that's even more impressive. This is the kind of movie you shouldn't watch at home alone in the dark. 2"
Mamma Mia!             ,bob the moo,1,comedy,2008,NA,"The critical and audience reactions to this film seemed to suggest that it was very much a Marmite of a film, with people either loving it or hating it. By the time I thought I should check it out, the ""biggest film of the year"" had become a sing-a-long classic and I decided to wait for the DVD. Watching it myself I can totally understand why this reaction was forthcoming and it is not really down to the film so much as it is the viewers. See, those that hate it will do so for the same reasons as those that love it. Mamma Mia is a film version of a stage-show but it is not an adaptation in that it has been made into a film so much as it is a stage musical made into a film. What I mean by this clunky sentence is that all the standards of the cheesy musical have been left in <U+0096> from ""big"" action, colour and simple dumb cheer.For me personally this doesn't really appeal and nor did I particularly enjoy the film as it did feel all forced smiles and joys, scenes shoe-horned to fit the lyrics and fake fun in the actors and extras. By the end I had pretty much had as much camp fun as I could really stand and was glad it was done. Now others have taken that to mean that the film is rubbish, but it isn't <U+0096> it just didn't work for you either. However for what it does Mamma Mia is actually very good because it knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do. Yes this means that it is daft and cheesy but that sort of ""big"" cheerfulness is what the target audience want <U+0096> they want to feel elated and lifted even if it isn't real in any form. In that regard the film delivers as it is built on beautiful colours in the sets and costumes and a cast that put their egos to one side and throw themselves into it.This last part is important because to my disinterested eye all the star actors came off looking daft. Streep is certainly not someone I expected to be doing this and to her credit she throws herself into it, showing a camp overacting side I didn't know she had. Likewise Walters, Baranski, Firth, Brosnan and Skarsgård all do much the same <U+0096> albeit to varying degrees of success. If you're into it then the ""big"" performances are all part of the fun but if, like me, you're not, then it will be endlessly embarrassing and it will be hard to shake the feeling that I was watching award-winning actors making themselves look and sound like muppets. Of course that is why they are ""good"" in the context of what the film is trying to be and yet at the same time ""bad"" if you are not in the swing of the film.What we are left with then is a film that we have seen plays really well to those that get it but leaves everyone else wondering why on earth people like Streep and Walters would make such nonsense. I personally disliked it but that does not make it a ""bad"" film, only a bad one from my point of view. For what it sets out to do though, it is a winning achievement <U+0096> full of cheerful cheese and lots of colour. In fact, it is such a targeted film that you will already know whether you will love it or hate it long before you press play"
Surveillance             ,Mischa0326,1,crime,2010,1,"I actually registered for the sole purpose of reviewing this terrible movie. I'm shocked at the number of reviews who say they were surprised by the end. From the moment the characters were introduced it was crystal clear how the movie was going to play out. The only reason I watched it all was because I figured there was no way they would make it so obvious. But, alas, they did. The acting was poorly done - I think they could've at least tried to be subtle. The only bright spot was the little girl - she is the only remotely likable character in this whole mess. The worst part is, the ""twist"" isn't even original. Just an appallingly bad movie - skip!!"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,venessalewis,1,misc,2008,3,"The ""Other Boleyn Girl"" hit theaters today, and of course, I was in for the first showing. I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production. Why can't directors seem to get it right when it comes to this time period?I understand completely the Hollywood concept of ""dramatic"" flair for the big screen. But there is a difference between ""dramatic flair"" and complete revisionist history. This movie makes the HBO series, ""The Tudors"" seem like a BBC documentary as far as factual information is concerned.Now, the director is not all to blame. Phillippa Gregory does a damn good job of distorting the truth in this alternate interpretation of the story of Anne Boleyn. Her portrayal of Anne as ruthlessly ambitious and downright devilish is at odds with the softer portrayals favored by Jean Plaidy and other authors of this period. Anne's own diaries would suggest her true personality to be more of the unwilling victim and royal pawn in the schemes cooked up by her ambitious male relatives. Only when she discovered that her path in life would be to submit or face death or exile does she succumb to Henry's advances. The opening scenes of the movie concern how Anne and Henry met. Well, there is debate on this, the movie selects Hever. I'll allow that. But this first it was most certainly not in front of the whole court and followed by a hunt in which Henry takes a tumble, to be nursed back to health by Mary, Anne's OLDER sister (the movie and book portrays her as the younger sister-this is false). Anne's ambitions are apparent from this very day, she indeed seems to find her father and uncle's schemes appealing and agrees to ""hunt"" his majesty. Hardly the case in reality. Anne was in love with and betrothed to Henry Percy at the time of her first meeting with Henry. The movie has it backwards. She does not ""settle"" for Percy only after Mary has ""stolen"" Henry. Another extremely annoying point of order here<U+0085>.Cardinal Wolsey is completely absent from this film. This is such a blaring error as to render the movie completely abominable. Wolsey is such a force in the entire drama, from the arrangement of the marriage AND the divorce, to all matters of state and religion in between<U+0085>to leave him out is both amateur and foolish, not to mention a missed opportunity for much needed plot thickening.Running through the laundry list of other inaccuracies<U+0085>.Anne was not EXILED to France because she fumbled her attempt to seduce Henry. This is utterly ridiculous. It is well known that both Anne and Mary practically grew up in the French court from the time they were 12 to their late teens. Only then did the sisters join the English court, much less begin their dramas with the king. And she was not brought back to entertain Henry whilst Mary lay in with his child. Again<U+0085>Anne most strongly wanted to marry her first love, Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. But once Henry had set his eyes upon her and chose to make her his own, then and only then were her uncle and father's schemes put into motion. Their original intentions were to milk the long-going affair of her sister Mary for all it was worth.Now, as for the ""incest"" theory. Gregory is taking a huge risk here by suggesting that the allegation levied upon Anne and her brother George was indeed founded in truth, borne out of Anne's desperation to get with child after her miscarriage. I do believe Anne was desperate to get pregnant quickly, and she was very close to her brother<U+0085>but this is a huge leap, and one true historians would never make. It also suggest that something other than Henry's brute desires were at play here when he charged them with treason, which is not the case. He simply wanted to be rid of Anne, to beget a male heir off of his next mistress.And good gracious<U+0085>what of the rape scene? Not only is this disturbing, but so far fetched. Although Anne resisted for years, when she finally gave in to Henry, she did believe herself to be in love with him<U+0085>or at the very least, resigned to accept her fate. And Henry was completely besotted with her<U+0085>.why else would he break from Rome, Catholicism and risk his kingdom for anything less? No, he would not have raped Anne for their first sexual encounter. He was a brute, but he was most concerned of his image of the romantic courtier when it came to women's affections.Finally, a note on the characters. Portman does an acceptable job portraying the character from the book<U+0085>even though this character is not the true Anne Boleyn. Johannson makes a lovely Mary<U+0085>and probably quite close to the real woman. As for Bana<U+0085>a sore disappointment. Bad casting, bad acting. Is this the same Bana of the acclaimed Munich and Troy? Where was the range? He comes across as flat and not well studied. Jonathon Rhys Meyers of the HBO Tudors blows him out of the water on all levels<U+0085>.sensuality, intensity and evil as Henry the 8th.Why can't I just watch these movies and leave feeling entertained? I don't quite know<U+0085>I care too much about 15th century England for some reason. It became hardwired in me after watching Anne of the Thousand Days as a young girl. No Tudor movie since then has gotten close in accuracy or sheer entertainment since then. Burton and Bujold are classic and untouchable. But after watching this hack job, I have to say I am looking forward to the new season of the Tudors on HBO. 1"
The Brothers Bloom             ,Quinoa1984,1,action,2009,7,"The Brothers Bloom starts off with a bang of cinematic energy. We're introduced, by a kind of whimsical narrator not unlike one might have remembered from Pushing Daisies, to the brothers, Stephen and Bloom, as children in a town where everything is one-note: one group of kids, one store, one this or that. Stephen, the more inventive one of the duo (or rather, the one that will whip up a plan with a quirk or two not unlike Owen Wilson in Bottle Rocket), devises the first con to be that of intriguing the hell out of a group of kids- first part introducing Bloom to a girl, which he likes right away- and then leading to a cave that tricks them all into believing something is there which, of course, is not.This entire section, about five to ten minutes, is a brilliant short film, self-contained within itself and donning the kind of energy that, again, can be comparable to Wes Anderson. This is not to knock Rian Johnson as an original talent. He is. But for anyone that's seen any of Anderson's films, specifically Bottle Rocket and Rushmore and Life Aquatic, this is that kind of speedy intro that includes very precise pans and movements with the camera and facial expressions that mark this as something, well, ""different"". This also appears to be how the rest of the story will pan out, this distinctive, acute and stylish endeavor of film-making, as the brothers, grown up (Adrien Brody as Bloom, Mark Ruffalo as Stephen) are continuing with their cons until Bloom wants out, leading up to the typical ""one-last-con"" deal where-in they'll con a reclusive New Jersey heiress Penelope (Rachel Weisz) who has way too much time on her hands as well as money for the taking.Then there's the complications, of romance between Bloom and Penelope, and the complication that she's let in on Stephen and Bloom being ""artifact smugglers"", then the appearance of a certain nefarious figure known as ""Diamond Dog"", and meanwhile their Silent Bob figure, Bang Bang (Rino Kikuchi), tags along as someone who we only find out late in the game of the story that she has a cell phone (?) and can make origami at just the right moment.All of this makes The Brothers Bloom sound quite plot driven, not to mention the ups and downs and twists and turns of the cons that happen, or don't, between the brothers, Penelope, the revelations, etc. Depending on the viewer, and how much they'll want to believe or, frankly, how many movies they've seen of this type (one could see this as being a slick parody of a film like 2003's Confidence, also co-starring Rachel Weisz if memory serves), it's like following magicians doing work, not believing a thing or believing everything. Or some of it, perhaps. It's almost like the Prestige if it didn't actually want the audience to believe in magic. More that Johnson wants the audience to make the distinction between characters who draw their own reality and can't seem to break out into their own ""unwritten"" roles.And yet, for all the story's twists and turns, its strengths are in the characters. It's actually, not too unlike Anderson (again, sorry), more European influenced in that regard as it takes us along on its journey because of the characters, not the other way around. This helps since the characters all work with their respective players, more or less. More because of Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz, who play off each other wonderfully as an at-first awkward couple who get further romantically involved (there's a wonderful, spot-on charming scene where we see them kiss, and we understand clearly Penelope is having her first French-style) and connect closest with how Johnson casts them. Less with Ruffalo, who grew on me as the film went on, mainly towards the end (his last scene, without spoiling much, is a keeper for his extended reel), since he's meant to be conniving and devilish but doesn't really fit in even as he's good at delivering the lines and countering Brody and Weisz.The other way it's also European is that it's meant to be, and is, a director's tour-de-force. As the sophomore effort of Rian Johnson, after his first very impressive debut Brick (which, I should note, also tooled playfully with conventions of a genre as he attempts here), he's aiming quite high. The only problem that I encountered with it was that, perhaps by some proxy of the script, it takes a lot to really get emotionally wound up with these people.The style of his camera, the tricks of his editing, are like cons in and of themselves, but there's (apologies for this over-used word) quirks to the proceedings that deflate some scenes that would work much better in straightforward terms (I may have been the only one rolling my eyes at the ""knickname"" for Bang Bang being Yuengling with the line ""Yuengling, like the beer?""). Sometimes this excess-of-style works well, like when we flash through all of the ""hobbies"" Penelope does in her countless spare time at her mansion. Other times, sad to say, it just calls attention to itself without being cool-hip ala Ocean's Eleven or warm-hearted ala (one more time) an Anderson picture.And yet, for the gripes I might have had, it's impossible for me to ignore what Johnson has shown here and in Brick. He delivers characters we want to watch and situations that unfold with diverting, entertaining results, even as one might never fully believe what will happen next. Or maybe we do. He's a director that isn't going away, and to me this is a good thing. That's no con. 7.5/10"
Gran Torino             ,Len9876,0,drama,2008,10,"Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it.""There are at least four reason why I like this film: 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war-- and die if necessary--to preserve freedom (and he has a medal to prove it), 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed (and everyone around him seems to indicate--in one way or another--that he is no appreciated or needed), 3. even with a transformation, he demonstrates that people tend to be reactive--rather than responsive--and are slow to change (this is particularly true with bias, discrimination, and prejudice), and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding (he tries to give tough love, but he becomes softer in his response--instead of his reaction--after giving and receiving genuine love). It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns, before he even has died, instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation, and he knows absolutely nothing about culture, diversity, ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation. He does know about aging, however (if nowhere else, he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions, everywhere around him). He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect, so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And, trust must be earned.If this is Clint Eastwood's last film, I can only say that that his performance, in this stunning film, is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in ""Milk"" (Sean Penn), ""Australia"" (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), ""Changeling"" (Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood), and ""The Dark Knight"" (a riveting performance by ""Brokeback Mountain's"" Heath Ledger). In viewing all of these films, there are performances that are not only superb, but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a gay person, I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk, I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But, I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And, ""Gran Torino"" (2008) is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film, without saying that they haven't learned something, or without saying (just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing) 'there's no business (quite) like show business'. I rank ""Gran Torino"" (2008) a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact, his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in ""Nobody's Perfect"". 4"
The Lucky Ones             ,brian_r_wright,,adventure,2009,7,"Kind of a road picture for soldiers home from the Iraqi front, I don't think writer/director Neil Burger intends to make an antiwar statement... but pretty much any human being with a heart will take it as such. The quote above, ""No, thank YOU,"" occurs at several points in the story as these three soldiers, on leaveFred Cheaver (Tim Robbins), T.K. Poole (Michael Peña), and Colee Dunn (Rachel McAdams)make their way across the US. What happens is they have a transaction with a civilian who learns they're from the front, and the soldier will say thank you to end the exchange, to which the civilian will say, ""No, thank YOU.""

The Duchess             ,dbogosian-1,1,misc,2008,8,"""The Duchess"" tells the tale of the beautiful young Georgiana Spencer (Knightley) who, in the late 18th century, is married to the much older Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes) and attains wealth, status, and prestige, all at the price of being condemned to a loveless marriage. It's familiar ground: the duke is the typically phlegmatic English nobleman, unable to express or perhaps even experience emotions, while his wife is in every way his superior: in intellect, courage, self-reliance, devotion to children, etc.Most of the story revolves around the inequality between men's and women's lives: the former openly flaunting their mistresses while the latter are forbidden such dalliances. Men don't come off very well in this movie: they beat their wives, threaten them with separation from their children, and treat their girls with utter indifference while a boy is the ultimate prize.While the plot is not altogether scintillating, the acting more than makes up for it. Knightley is at her best, able to convey all the emotions the role requires. But the star of this movie is Fiennes, who in spite of playing a truly unlikeable character, manages to keep him from being utterly detestable. At the end, his humanity finally breaks through just a little bit, and one wishes the script would have allowed a few more glimmers at earlier points in the movie as well.But even if one were to magically delete all dialogue from the film, and just watch it on the big screen with the soundtrack, it would be well worth it. The constant parade of fashions, primarily women's but also men's, is like a documentary of late 18th century clothing. Each scene seems to outdo the other. It's like walking through a museum full of Gainsborough and Reynolds portraits, and seeing each one come to life; wonderful! The stately mansions, the magnificent teams of horses, the sweeping vistas of gardens and sheep on the pastures, it's all England at its very finest. The soundtrack was beautiful, lush and romantic and very apropos. I particularly liked the inclusion of much period music which was intelligently (though not always accurately) paired with the era. Was Bach played in England in 1775? I rather doubt it, but still it fit nicely and sounded gorgeous.Do see this on the big screen; don't wait for the DV"
The Ruins             ,alvinvigil,,adventure,2008,8,"Just when you thought it was safe to vacation in Mexico comes the new horror film The Ruins, based on a pretty cool book (or so I've heard) by Scott Smith, who adapted his own book into the screenplay. Four attractive American college students, Jeff, Eric, Amy and Stacy meet a German traveler while on vacation in Cancun who tells them about a hidden Mayan archaeological dig site in the jungle he plans to explore. Do they tag along, of course they do. So off they all go after a night of heavy tequila drinking along with another attractive Greek guy. Almost immediately, they sense something is wrong upon arriving at the Mayan temple, inundated with vines and beautiful red rosy flowers. This isn't your typical Little Shop of Horrors vegetation, either. The ruins have an evil aura about them and the unsuspecting vacationers are suddenly trapped on top of the ruin, as some Mayan descendants make camp around the ruin so as to keep them from escaping the ancient temple. There's plenty of good stuff in The Ruins. Queensland, Australia substitutes for the mountains and landscape of Cancun (must be those extra tax breaks). And the young cast are good enough to add a sense of realism to the horror that is brought upon them. The Mayan cast, also, who ""quarantine"" the tourists on top of the Mayan ruin, are quite effective. First time director, Carter Smith, definitely brings on the chills and thrills in The Ruins. There's a psychological nature that plays well, but I've got to tell you, this movie is pretty damn gross. Smith goes straight for the gut-wrenching thrills. It's pretty graphic as far as graphic violence can go. You'll be squirming in your seat during a couple of horrific scenes when a traveler is injured with a broken back and another has these creepy-crawler vines inside of her body as they try to take them out using a hunting knife. Lots of gore and blood here, so in that sense, it delivers. The Ruins is a decent enough thrill ride that will make you think twice about visiting any type of ancient ruin yet to be discovered while on your next vacation in the jungle."
Quarantine             ,owen_williams-1,1,horror,2008,1,"OK this is not a bad film. It really isn't, it's actually very average compared to the other awful zombie fare coming from the US in recent years. It really can't be that bad can it? It's a pretty much shot for shot remake of a great film. And herein lies the problem...Why would anyone watch, pay money for or endorse a film which is a shot for shot remake of another, much better, film? How would anyone make money out of this from a distribution standpoint? The answer sadly is because we are lazy lazy people who can't relate to anything outside of our incredibly small geography or sphere of influence. If an audience is called to watch subtitles to see a great film like REC, you have people lining up to remake it without. Because they know that a quick and effortless buck can be made off the joe shmoe's who can't be bothered or who don't have the mental capacity to both read a subtitle and keep track of images at the same time. Never mind that what they are seeing is a poor second place, at least its good ole American actors damnit! This extends further, it can't even be set in Madrid! Like the office couldn't be set in England, no this must be in LA, with second rate actors, mediocre translations of the original script and contrived camera work in place of the clever devices and aesthetics which created REC; one of the most atmospheric and genuine horror films of recent years.This viewing malaise cannot relate to a film outside of its own time even. Think Gus Van Sant, think the remake of Psycho, think why the hell did he remake a film shot for shot with Vince Vaughn instead of Anthony Perkins. Because its in colour, that's why and it's set in the present and otherwise how could any of these poor saps be expected to follow it.This is at least better than the truly blasphemous remakes of The Ring and The Grudge, perhaps due to the lack of gap here between US and Japanese cinematography, but there is still this deeper issue in US cinema. The fact that any film without a US passport and contemporary time stamp has to be remade. Or not even has to be but CAN be... and can make money to boot. This is a terrible state of affairs which serves no purpose than to further remove any artistic intent from film in the effort to dumb down content for a quick buck. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, The Hitcher, Haloweeen, REC, The Grudge, The Ring, The Eye, Psycho... RIP, good films all! I expect the Mona Lisa to be repainted as a god damn cheerleader any day now... "
Fireflies in the Garden             ,kosmasp,0,drama,2008,7,"I watched this movie at the Berlin Film Festival and I have to admit that I was surprised by Ryan Reynolds. He can play the dramatic role(s) as you can see him do here ...His performance anchors the movie and although we have other great actors here too, he is the one that leads us into and through the story. You won't be surprised to hear/read that the story is semi-auto-biographical. It is that deep and it goes into his characters. Having said that, William Dafoe is somewhat of a show-stealer too. Although I do think he could have been a bit better sketched (yes OK he's defined by a real human, but it feels more like a restriction to me). All in all, a drama with occasional light moments in an overall dark story."
Gran Torino             ,Simon_Says_Movies,0,drama,2009,9,"If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood's long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.You know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can't bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood's direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.Following the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt's less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to 'keep an eye on him', but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family's youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt's life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.With a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face."
Pathology             ,gargamel_gargamel,1,crime,2008,7,"This is interesting. I lower budget gorefest that I expected to love because it was so cheesy and instead end up liking because it is actually good! I love B rate cheese fest horror movies, and thought this would be another.... but.This story is well written and not too far out of the realm of possibility. Sure at some point hospital security or what not would have noticed bodies being moved into an empty wing and incinerated yada yada yada. However, it is believable that some forensic doctors might go crazy and do some of the things in the movie.. especially with all the drugs/alcohol these doctors were consuming.The acting is overall pretty good. The only performance that was kind of flat for me was the professor that mentors these students. The doctors themselves all did a fine job and were really believable.Was there too much gore and gratuitous sex as others have mentioned?? Let's put it this way, there was enough gore, but not too much. Not for the squeamish, but not over the top either. And I only remember 3 sex scenes, one of which had no nudity whatsoever and the other 2 had quick flashes of breasts only. These scenes were instrumental to the plot and not there just to show nudity. There are a couple of scenes of dead women with their breasts exposed but what do you expect in a morgue? And it's nothing more than you would see on National Geographic or Discovery Channel.Overall I give this movie props.... surprisingly. Now for the Gargamel Scale : 1 for nudity, 1 for story, 1 for acting, there were no car chases.. so 0 there, and no gunfire/explosions, but there was lots of killing... so I'll give a 0.5 there. That's 3.5 total for you non-math majors. That equates to a 7 on the IMDb 10 point scale.This movie season is finally starting to get better!"
Gomorrah             ,cnewf,,crime,2008,3,"Roberto Saviano wrote a great book about how the Napoli-area crime ""system"" was modernizing itself. The System did this by globalizing itself - partnering (unofficially) with major fashion houses, for example, making drug retail more friendly and suburban, and using its military arm to protect its carefully constructed, often brilliantly executed economic interests. The gangster stuff in the book is entirely the effect of the system - the neocapitalist crime system that operates globally, that ties southern Italy not just to Columbia but to Bulgaria and Romania - you really have to read the book, which is vivid and also comprehensive.The movie simply disappears The System. None of the causal forces detailed in the book survive. This is the most blatant and inexcusable dumbing down of book into a movie that I've seen in years - inexcusable because the book IS the system and not the sh-thead gangsters. You don't really need to see the 425th remake of Boyz n the Hood (which was a better movie than this). You don't really need to see another treatment of the ""culture of poverty,"" the ""underclass"" depicted as aimless sociopaths. This film has as much insight as your average episode of Law and Order, so watch a rerun instead.I can't believe the book author Saviano gets a writing credit for this dumbness. I hope it was a straight payoff, no work involved.The book was journalism. This film just makes up whatever it wants. The worst example of this is the butchery of the book's most moving scene, when the boy from the hood who is actually a brilliant couturier, and sews dresses that end up on A-list stars in Hollywood, freaks out when he sees one of his dresses on Angelina Jolie (pointlessly renamed as another famous actress). In the movie Pasquale (who is randomly 20 years older than the book's counterpart), sees the movie's version AFTER he already made the career decision that the Angelina Jolie scene produces in the book, and he has no emotional reaction. Same goes for his relationship to the Chinese workers - a time-consuming, sensationalist escalation of what in the book was a simple and attractive gesture.Calling All Film Directors: dumb isn't fun. Dumb is boring. Stop it."
Frost/Nixon             ,blanche-2,0,misc,2011,NA,"Peter Morgan adapted his wonderful stage play Frost/Nixon for film with tremendous success. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of the famous series of interviews.For all many of us who lived through the Nixon presidency and Watergate, this is not the stuff of nostalgia or happy reminiscence. And when the Nixon tapes were published and his bigotry against just about everyone was revealed in explicit ""expletive deleted"" language, it was time to get disgusted all over again.Here, portrayed by Frank Langella, we see Nixon as a lonely, vulnerable, angry, and bitter human being, a man who's made a bed he must sleep in for the next twenty years. We also see a manipulative and highly intelligent individual who, despite a great deal of success, had no self-worth. It's the feeling of being an outsider, of never being good enough, that led him to some atrocious decisions.It's Langella's performance and Michael Sheen's wonderful performance as David Frost -- playboy, comedian, talk show host, and party-giver turned investigative journalist -- that anchor ""Frost/Nixon."" They are given great support by Kevin Bacon as Nixon's protective assistant, Jack Brennan, Sam Rockwell as James Reston, determined that Nixon pay for Watergate, as well as Oliver Platt, Matthew Mcfadyen, and Toby Jones.I found the determination of Frost as he attempted to raise financing for the interviews and get networks interested -- with no luck -- very admirable and inspiring. And his gut instinct paid off for him big time.I transcribed an interview with Nixon that took place in his home in the 1980s, as well as a speech he made during one of the Presidential election periods. He was a brilliant speaker, and as an interviewee, when the interview was over, he engaged the reporter in a very friendly personal conversation. In the end, both those listening experiences made me sad, as did this film. For everything he achieved, Richard Nixon had undeveloped gifts and potential. He robbed the world of a lot more than the ability to trust government. But in the end, as the film shows, he robbed himself the mos"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,mr_popcorn,0,animation,2008,5,"I was never really a fan of the first movie, I thought it was a good premise but was poorly put together and the situations they found themselves in the first movie is just way out there. The Penguin quartet stole that show for me and was the only humorous thing that kept the movie from falling apart. I just saw this sequel just for the heck of it and in my opinion, this is a step above from its predecessor but however, not that big of a deal to me. I saw it, I laughed three or four times and maybe tomorrow I'll forget it. Its the same old schtick you saw in the first one, even that annoying old lady returns and your favorite castaways still find themselves in hilarious situations that are way out there.It was a good thing that they added more characters but it almost felt like they were just there for decoration. Maybe throw in a couple of hilarious quips and do something that a normal animal won't do and that's that. And like in the first movie, the Penguins still stole everyone's thunder and still kept the movie from falling apart. Forget the part where a shark hops and skips across the barren wildlife of Africa and the idea of an old lady going Rocky on an adult lion, I just wanted to see these penguins cause trouble but now in a different location. They deserve a spin-off, stat."
Sex and the City             ,wricketts,1,comedy,2008,3,"Cute enough for an evening's mindless entertainment, but exactly that and not a penny more. Put aside any thought you might have about not caring a great deal about what happens to a group of rich, superficial white women who (you are told) are actually very smart and talented but who (you are shown) are silly twits (not to use a different vowel) whose exclusive joy in life comes from sex and shopping, and not in that order. I know, I know; we're supposed to believe this is all about love (and the search for same), but it isn't; love is secondary. We're supposed to believe it's about solidarity among a group of women friends and it is, but that's more-or-less an accident. It's really about consuming <U+0096> clothes, purses, shoes <U+0096> and other human beings. The introduction of Jennifer Hudson (who tries really hard not to be appalled by the level of minstrel-show tokenism her presence represents) as Carrie's personal assistant is so painful and so blatant an attempt to give a tiny bit of color to the TV series' snow-blinding whiteness that you can't help but be embarrassed for absolutely everyone. Here's another film in which women are stand-ins for what is essentially a gay-male fantasy about women (an art form that George Cukor pioneered in 1939 with _The Women_) Take your brain out and store it in Tupperware for the evening; _Sex and the City_ will make you smile, but not laugh out loud. If you spend a minute thinking about it, though, all it's going to do is make you mad. 1"
Prom Night             ,hypostylin,1,horror,2008,1,"Ah, the old now-you-see-him-now-you-don't bathroom medicine cabinet mirror gag! Edgy! Ooh, the prom-date-making-her-grand-descent-down- the-stairs-in-her-best-teenybopper- regalia shot! Innovative! More than any other remake of late, Prom Night aggressively reaches out to the shopping mall multiplex crowd -- kids who are too young to notice its pervasive clichés. In fact, it feels more like a Scream clone than a standard remake, thwacking us over the head with airy dialogue about boys, hair, and dresses (one character exclaims, ""Oh my God, you guys!!!~~~"" in a cadence that somehow demands the use of tildes) and milking a slew of ever-so-hip musical re-appropriations (including a drab and downright funereal cover of The Zombies' ""Time of the Season"").There is zero style in the cinematography, editing, story, or sound design here. It's all warbly booms, balanced soap opera lighting, and quick cuts framing a hackneyed, lazy, and dubious plot. It's hard to believe that J.S. Cardone, who wrote and directed the phenomenal 1982 slasher The Slayer, penned this pile of sugar-laced garbage. It's a prom for platitudes. If anything, Prom Night shows us how out-of-touch these nouveau slashers are with their forefathers. By spelling everything out for us and rigidly expressing its killer's motives and sentiments from the very beginning, it strips away any potential intrigue -- it makes no attempt at the mystery angle that was somewhat palpable (if not altogether effective) in the 1980 Prom Night. And, because it's firmly planted in PG-13 slasher-lite territory, it doesn't even have geek show appeal.Despite the fact that such practicalities as the killer's name, identity, and wrap sheet are completely revealed to us early on in the first reel, Prom Night is surprisingly tight-lipped about his origins. He is a former high school teacher -- that much I ascertained -- but under what circumstances did he become obsessed with our platinum blonde Final Girl? Simply put: what is the point? And what's with that boring baseball cap he wears? The scariest thing about this guy is his level of banality.Even inferior slashers tend to raise the octane in the last 20-30 minutes or so, when the Final Girl has spotted all her dead friends and encountered the killer and the cat-and-mouse game ensues. Prom Night, however, is interminably boring in its latter quarter. We tediously follow the cops around the hotel as they make austere discoveries of bodies we've already seen slain. We also watch the Final Girl laze around her bedroom a lot, with nary a bag of tricks in sight. It all leads up to a matter-of-fact and unceremonious climax that actually has you thinking, ""That's it?""Perhaps the only good thing about this tepid junk is winsome newcomer Dana Davis, who, unfortunately, doesn't last long enough to make a complete impact. I guess I should have prefaced that last sentence with a spoiler warning. Oh, who cares?"
The Square             ,davdecrane,0,crime,2010,6,"What would be a fun find on cable one night isn't worth a trip to the theater. An expertly plotted story (with a particularly clever blackmail subplot) suffers from uninspired casting in the male lead. This actor embodies the film's fatal flaw: an almost total lack of humor. Film noir is necessarily a downer genre but think how funny Body Heat and Chinatown are with their clever protagonists (and Chandler always has you laughing). The Square, however, features morose David Roberts who should be dancing with joy from his affair with the much younger, cuter, livelier Claire van der Bloom. But he's conflicted from the get-go and the director never lets us see what drew these two together in the first place. There's little chemistry between them and a few scenes between two dogs hold more joy than anything between the impassionate human lovers. The most interesting male actor is co-writer Joel Edgerton and the story might have had more sizzle if he'd been the lead.But the plot does indeed generate some real tension and the film is watchable. Bodies pile up unexpectedly, there's a mystery inside a mystery with the strong subplot and the ending holds real surprises. The script works but the director, through his casting and tone choices, lets it and us down."
Frozen River             ,scrbblr,1,crime,2009,5,"I'm afraid I side with Michael McGonigle and ""Turfseer"" and ""zetes,"" who, as of this writing, have offered up the only negative appraisals of this film (and extremely perceptive ones at that). Aside from an excellent performance by Charlie McDermott as a resourceful 15-year-old, ""Frozen River"" has one major virtue: the bleak, wintry, impoverished upstate New York setting, which lends the movie its tone. It was apparently shot in Plattsburgh, and let's just say the town does not come off as a garden spot. I've lived and worked in places like that, and they definitely aren't charming in the winter -- especially if, as in this film, you concentrate on shabby trailers, bare front yards, clapboard general stores, slate-grey skies, and lonely, icy roads. Which is fine, by the way; it's a genuine slice of northern America, raw and poor and forbidding, and I assume it is this setting that's mainly responsible for the acclaim the movie has received -- this and the landscape's human equivalent, Melissa Leo's hard, unglamorous, unyouthful face. That raw, hardscrabble locale is certainly what attracted me to the film. And in fact, ""Frozen River"" seems to have been given something of a pass by critics because of its gritty look, because it gives a starring role, for a change, to an unglamorous middle-aged actress, and because it displays familiar liberal sympathies (for impoverished single moms, Native Americans, and desperate illegal Third World immigrants, including two very attractive young Chinese women). Unfortunately, bleak look aside, ""River"" was a well-intentioned disappointment. For one, it's all too predictable: You KNOW that when Ray (Melissa Leo's character) tosses a Pakistani couple's suspicious bundle out the car window into the snow, she'll later learn there was a baby inside; you know that the baby will eventually be returned alive (Ray's the heroine, for God's sake, not a baby-killer); you know that Ray and Lila, the Mohawk woman, are going to overcome their mutual hostility as the film progresses and that, in a show of transracial solidarity, they'll bond and learn to respect each other; you know that something's going to go wrong on that ""one last smuggling run"" the two women are compelled to take. I concur with my three fellow IMDb commenters that the Pakistanis' passivity in handing over their baby to strangers -- and in the face of its apparent death -- seems downright unbelievable; ditto Ray's unseen husband's running off at Christmastime with the family's meager savings; ditto Ray's inability to put decent food on the table in this era of food stamps; ditto a clumsy, unconvincing scene in which Lila, previously denied her baby, simply strolls into her mother-in-law's home and, ignoring said mother-in-law, silently walks off with the child. Too many scenes, like this one, just come off looking amateurish. But the main problem I had is with the unrealistically spare dialogue -- as if the director/screenwriter had scribbled down a few bare bones of conversation in the expectation that her actors would improvise, build upon them, and flesh out the scenes, only to have the actors stick to those few curt words. People who live in rural communities and small towns TALK to one another. They talk a lot -- often too much, I've found. They tell stories; they ramble on. They're known for it down south, but they do it up north as well. They are amiable and humorous; even when they have something serious to say, they say it with a smile. It's how they get along, especially in a somewhat inhospitable environment, because they have to rely on one another. It's what cements a community. In short, people up there are generally friendly. (In fact, let me go further: Assuming circumstances don't compel them to be otherwise, human beings as a species are generally friendly.) Yet filmmakers -- with some unconscious class condescension, I suspect -- are always depicting their northern rural characters as curt and taciturn and dour, as if the filmmakers assume that these people are as hard-bitten as the landscape. (In ""Affliction,"" a similarly unsatisfying movie set in a wintry small town, this time in New England, I recall that most of the characters treated the hero -- a disgraced onetime local law-enforcement officer, played by Nick Nolte -- with rudeness and undisguised contempt. And it simply didn't ring true. First, you don't keep dumping on someone Nick Nolte's size; second, people want to be buddies with cops and sheriffs, even former ones; third, the entire populace seemed improbably sour and nasty.) Repeatedly, in ""Frozen River,"" we're shown what passes for ""conversations"" that consist of a few muttered words back and forth, whereas in real life there'd be lots and lots of talk. One weirdly perfunctory scene has a Mohawk man demand that Ray's teenaged son apologize to an old woman the boy has tried to scam. The boy mumbles ""Sorry"" and walks away; the man instantly accepts it and drives off with the woman. It's a clueless screenwriter's idea of how a scene like that might play out among taciturn rural types; it's utterly fake, unconvincing, and, again, amateurish. And a crucial scene at the end, in which Lila arrives at Ray's trailer with her child and simply barges in on the son without explanation and with practically no words exchanged, seems almost ludicrous, as if the screenwriter had just plain run out of inspiration."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,DrKDB,0,misc,2009,3,"The cinematography is/was excellent. I have to admit that this movie, because of my lack of familiarity with the subject was a hard thing to watch. It's like a thick heavy piece of dark multi-grain bread. You know it has a lot of substance but it's hard to enjoy.I'm one of those people at the movie rental places that the clerk is always telling, ""you know....this is subtitled."" As if I'm going to drop it on the counter- realizing, suddenly (oh my God) that this is A FOREIGN FILM- and, realizing my mistake, thanks to that warning, run back down the aisle to grab a copy of ""Police Academy 12"".But, that's not me. I really do enjoy foreign cinema- most of it is incredibly rich and fulfilling. I just want to give everyone a little 'heads-up' without revealing any 'spoilers', that this baby is thick, it's dark, and like the aforementioned bread, nutritious but not very enjoyable to digest"
Nim's Island             ,gcoast-1,1,adventure,2008,8,"I went and saw this movie at the world premiere. I will start out by saying this... It is a very good for the whole family to enjoy.Storyline: A girl and her father are on a remote island. They are the only ones who live their. The father is a research scientist who is interested in microscopic creatures. Nim, the daughter, is very much in touch with nature and enjoys reading the tales of Alex Rover, an adventurer. The author, Alexandra Rover, is agoraphobic and hasn't left her apartment in a very long time. Dad goes to sea, storm makes him stranded. Nim is stuck alone on the island and is contacted by Alexandra Rover, and calls for her help. Well, you will have to watch the rest to find out...Pros: A great family movie. It has the perfect recipe of drama, comedy, suspense and a touch of romance. The acting is great. The scenery is beautiful. The special effects are magnificent. The story of a father and daughter living on a remote island is very creative and lends itself to a really great story, which is what this movie is.Cons: Being a family movie, it is predictable. There are also plot elements which go no-where. One being there is a huge talk about Nim's mother at the beginning, but then it really doesn't go anywhere after that.Summary: If you have kids, of any age, this is a good movie to go and see with them. If you don't have kids, but are looking for something different from the usual movies, this is still one to consider. All in all, a good story, well told and with great characters."
Surveillance             ,sportingsteve,1,crime,2009,8,"A good thriller and I was hooked into this film within the first Ten Minutes and stayed involved for the entire ride. It kept me guessing throughout. The contrast between eerie cop shop and stark, beautiful prairies is a stylish treat for the eyes. The performances are believable and compelling. Well cast, without exception. The little girl is surprisingly good. Her even performance made me wonder about what had happened to her and drew me into the story. The ending is a clever, eerie choice. I was taken completely by surprise and I usually predict a ending a mile away Not In this case. It could have gone much further in that vein. Instead the tension relied upon intelligent visual storytelling. Kudos to everyone involved. I thoroughly enjoyed this film it left me Wanting More!"
Wanted             ,ronnay_barkay,1,action,2008,2,"Very poor movie. Even if you forgive the plot which is like something written by a person whose brain was seriously damaged in a bad accident.. Thats exactly what this movie is. A bad accident. It starts off fairly promising though. I deliberately didn't read any reviews or anything about it because I like to be pleasantly surprised by a movie which I have no pre-conceptions of.It all goes wrong when the main character is in a drug-store getting his panic-attack pills and Angelina Jolie suddenly appears beside him and starts telling him his father is an assassin and he just died, then all hell breaks loose and so begins the painfully over-the-top chase scene which eventually leads to more ridiculous scenes such as a bath full of wax which is meant to heal all his wounds in a day, and a magic loom that magically spells out secret binary messages in the stitching of people they must assassinate. Of course what we're not told is which side of the piece of cloth we should look at, at which stich we should start reading from, and when we do get a person's name, how do we know who to kill if there happens to be more than one person with that name.I am usually able to suspend my disbelief during a movie, and thus enjoy and be entertained by it. But with this movie I just couldn't, and if your I.Q. is above 50, you won't either. "
Adoration             ,Pawpcorn,0,drama,2017,1,"What amazes me the most about this film are the reviews that said words to the effect ""I had to watch it again and again"" etc. etc.The ONLY spellbinding aspect of this movie that kept me mildly enthralled was wondering ...will this movie EVER get any better, or even have a real ""point"" that I can take away from this??? ...is this movie a lead-up to a suspenseful climax??? Something that will make all this time I've spent watching it... worth while? Sadly, both answers were no.I found the plot simply ludicrous and unbelievable on so many levels... this COULD not and WOULD not have EVER played out like this... in real life.I virtually NEVER give a movie ONE star, but I've made the exception here.Simply dreadfu"
The Incredible Hulk             ,brando647,0,action,2008,8,"I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.One issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).It's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was ""That's IT?!"". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours."
The Express             ,bkoganbing,,misc,2008,10,"Ernie Davis whom I remember as a kid as the most promising college football player of his time made quite the impact on the world of sports back in the day. But is impact during the Civil Rights era in which he played is equally compelling a story. Both are united here in a wonderful sports film, The Express with young Rob Brown playing Ernie Davis. Brown plays Davis well as the idealistic young kid who takes as his ideal Jackie Robinson and the significance he had breaking the color line in professional baseball. Black people were already playing professional football at this time also, but the sport was not what it is today or in fact would shortly become starting in the middle Fifties when Davis was in college ball at the University of Syracuse.A guy who had a lot to do with that was Ernie Davis's predecessor at the University of Syracuse Jim Brown as played by Darrin DeWitt Henson. Brown's place among professional football immortals is quite assured and he came to the Cleveland Browns with the reputation from college he more than lived up to. In fact it's Brown that Coach Ben Schwartzwalder uses to recruit Davis to the Orangemen of Syracuse. Dennis Quaid plays the coach and he gives one of his best performances in his career. In fact it's right in line with another football film Any Given Sunday where he plays an aging quarterback with heart and guts, but losing a step or two in the field. The film is about Quaid almost as much as about Rob Brown. The coach learns that he's living in extraordinary times for America, most extraordinary for black America. His players are not separate and apart from the social changes going on, they and the game cannot be kept in a vacuum. Proof of that comes when the Orangemen of Syracuse go south to play West Virginia and later the University of Texas in the Cotton Bowl which was more of a war than an athletic contest.Ernie Davis beat out Jim Brown in two special categories. He was the first black man to win the Heisman Trophy for Best College Football player and probably earned it by dint of the fact that he unlike Brown led Syracuse to a national championship. It was a fact the Heisman Committee could not ignore.The football sequences as in Any Given Sunday are done incredibly well, choreographed would not be a bad word to describe them. Davis did in fact say he would let his field exploits do his talking and they spoke loud and clear.I hope some Oscar nominations are in the future for both Quaid and Brown. The Express will go down in history as one of the best sports films ever done and it goes along way towards keeping the story of Ernie Davis alive for generations to come"
Flash of Genius             ,nuhc,0,misc,2008,6,"This is another true David & Goliath story which pits a home inventor, Bob Kearns, who develops a working intermittent windshield wiper control, against the Ford Motor Company who stole his idea after he demonstrated it to them. The strain is at times too much for Kearns who eventually suffers a mental breakdown, but comes back to take on Ford in a monumental lawsuit despite the strains on his marriage & family.While a lot of people probably won't be interested in true life stories like this, I enjoy them and did enjoy this movie. The acting is good, and since the story is set in the 1960's & 1970's, you really get a feel for that era. It's worth a watch."
The Strangers             ,jacklmauro,,horror,2012,2,"Can we finally acknowledge that horror films have largely turned into another genre, that of sadism? There is a huge difference between film bloodshed and gore that is a part of a horrific/suspenseful scenario, and that which is done so the audience can watch people undergo agony, as in the 'Hostel' franchise. I can't take it. It is not scary; it's just disgusting. As in this film. Take away the idiot decisions about the gun, going outside, leaving your girl alone in an isolated home after a freak comes by, calling for help, etc., and there's the making for good, scary suspense. Turn it into an exercise in extended sadism, and it's purely gratuitous in a disturbing way. Do people actually think it's 'scary' or 'suspenseful' to watch the girl beg for her life, as she sees her guy stabbed and stabbed? It's not. It's unrelenting misery and there's something way wrong with anyone who thinks it's good filmmaking. The strangers were extremely terrifying, and there are psychopaths out there. But this nightmare of torture and sadism is NOT a great scary movie (which I love as a genre), or suspenseful. It's mean and ugly, and what scares me is how torture is the new horror."
Twilight             ,CaniCanz,1,misc,2008,5,"This is just one person's opinion. No need to get angry, in fact I'd like you to convince me I'm wrong.The movie is missing the magic. Edward appeared on screen and I swooned. He opened his mouth and I cringed. Edward is strong and confident. He wasn't a whiney, smitten child. In love yes, but brooding and in pain. Bella was delicate, not just dry and indifferent. This Bella lacked emotion maybe even a soul-who is she? She didn't feel like the yearning, thoughtful Bella I had imagined. I wished she needed to be protected. This version can take care of her own business--and I'm not sure how bad she wants to be with Edward, or why for that matter. Maybe if she narrated her emotions would have been more pronounced. Don't get me wrong, the actors' chemistry is very evident, they should get married and have melodramatic children. But was the film from Bella's perspective or not? The changing pov was off-putting. This film proves that Meyer's pages and pages are what bring this story and Edward and Bella's love to life.The TONE was completely lost in the book to script to screen translation. The story is supposed to be a song that takes you to another world, one where vampires and werewolves exist. The story is an intoxicating melody. Here we're presented with a boy-band pop song sung by kids who think of themselves as classically trained Opera singers. PICK ONE. Be a chart-topping, America's Top 40 or be the haunting, dangerous lullaby I think a lot of fans were looking for.Speaking of boy band...the screen version of Jacob Black is one ""Bye Bye Bye"" from being the lead singer in Over-Produced-Axe-Wearing-Guy-Group 2008. Jacob, in my mind, is earthy. He's a guy's guy and gets his hands dirty fixing cars and building stuff. Jacob always left me feeling like he was wise beyond his years, a smitten kitten of course, but I always felt that he was more dynamic than this cute little wig-wearing version. I always felt this sense of history and quiet power. This version wears Abercrombie (and randomly appears from behind trees apparently...you'll see).The cast was quite OK for me. I did feel bad watching them try to deliver the lines they were given. I get that this is a vampire-romance movie, but honestly. The script is dripping in gooey, sticky, melted, mixed cheeses. OK, so it's fantastical, but to slap me in the face with Gouda and Brie every other frame is just insulting. Cheese aside, Charlie was great. His timing was spot on. Carlisle played the part, but the caked-on white makeup so completely distracting. Esme-- I wanted to crawl up onto her lap and have her tell me bedtime stories. Love it. Alice... that's her on that screen. A little bouncier and she's perfect. Jasper-- freakishly creepy and pained, loved it. When he comes out of his shell and plays more than the wide-eyed silent sidekick, I'm all over it. Those who doubted Reed need to reconsider. Rosalie is freaking hot and one sassy vamp. Emmett...holy crap, on the money (call me). Jessica is the best casting job in life...Mike, however...really?I know that this is just a movie. Film is a different medium than books. We get to create the world from a book but people get to interpret for us on screen, I know. I just wish it wasn't so far off base for me. I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it. I think I'm going to remember the series the way I imagined it and set this version aside. My oil canvas painting to their Polaroid. Who's melodramatic now? This girl.Here's hopping they make a choice for the next one: teen scene or dark love story so audiences know what they're getting into. Teenie Boppers are quite loyal, perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office. 2"
Ghost Town             ,JoeKarlosi,0,misc,2008,7,"What really made this rather familiar story work for me was British comedian Ricky Gervais in the part of a grouchy NY dentist who starts seeing ghosts after he has a peculiar mishap during a routine colonoscopy. This is a lightweight comedy/drama/love story with elements that we've seen plenty of times before, but as I said I thought Gervais made all the difference, and it's his picture entirely. Had the part been played by Adam Sandler, Jim Carey, or some other over-exposed celebrity, it wouldn't have been as effective. Greg Kinnear is really an afterthought here as a dead man who keeps appealing to Gervais to help break up the inevitable wedding of his widow (Tea Leoni). *** out of ****"
What Happens in Vegas             ,msalmank,1,comedy,2008,9,"I was going to give this one a miss. Though i read what critics have to say, i never make a choice based on what they do say - for they are Critics after all.It was IMDb that actually got me to consider that this movie was not worthy to watch. I used to look at ratings at Movies.Yahoo but now i rely on what IMDb has to say, and when i saw the 5.0/10 rating, i was like; Wow! this must not be that good then.However, when i had no other options, i decided that i'd give this a go. And boy am i glad that i watched it. It is the best comedy to come out in a really long time, and i mean that 100%. It was fast - comedies loose their charm when they tend to go slow on you - quick in getting to the main story instead of lagging us on and on, and surprisingly the Vegas section was pretty small which was actually a Plus point! The acting was superb, some of the scenes were just hilarious, and others were great. The ending was expected, but then for such movies it is...All i can say is that it was after a really long time that i watched most of the movie again and again (yes twice) right after i had completed it.In short... if you want to have a great time and some good laughs then give this a go. You won't be disappointed. Don't sit down as a critic, but sit down as someone expecting to be entertained."
Igor             ,pugetsoundtransfer,0,animation,2008,8,"The movie was funny and entertaining for me and the kids. Not nearly as scary as ""Nightmare before Christmas"" for kids. The Igor character is likable and the sidekicks are excellent. The voice talent is matched up with the characters very well. This is one of the best kids films we have been to see at the theaters in a few years. It is right up there with Cars. We may go see this movie again at the theater and I am sure the DVD will keep the kids entertained again. It is great that an independent company can produce an entertaining film and we don't have to just wait to see what Pixar puts out. Go see this movie for yourself, you will not be disappointed."
The Merry Gentleman             ,mogsgame,,crime,2008,8,"The Merry Gentleman (Dir: Michael Keaton): The word on the ""street"" (or shuttle) was ""eh"" for Keaton's directorial debut, as it was for other gems like ""Quid Pro Quo"" and ""The Escapist"". That's too bad, especially considering hot tickets like ""The Great Buck Howard"" were underwhelming compared to the lower-profile films. The Merry Gentleman is slow paced, yes, but that's an attribute. Keaton doesn't rush anything in his story of a lonely young woman (Kelly McDonald) who is the locus of desire for several men, including her ex-husband (a great Bobby Cannavale), an alcoholic cop, and a suicidal hit-man (Keaton). He honors the complexity of the situation with an ending as open ended as it is authentic. It is a glowingly photographed, impeccably performed magical realist drama, one that I'm glad exists in a market where it cannot thrive (just like the best Alan Rudolph films). Taking place during two of the loneliest holidays (Christmas and Valentine's day), The Merry Gentleman is also a great religious film, movingly detailing McDonald's faith as she in turn becomes a figure of worship for men with a variety of intentions. It even ends with a resurrection. As a primer on our ability to ""save"" each other, this is nothing less than rapturous, and Keaton infuses the frame with snow, fluorescent light, and human encounters that match the melancholic beauty of the frame. With Game 6 and this film, Keaton has proved to be one of our most reliable and literate actors. He is also a knockout director. ****"
Pathology             ,Elynitthria,1,crime,2008,1,"OK, this is one of the really bad movies. It starts like an amateur porn with the inevitable porn sentence: girl to boy: ""f*ck me please"". And the quality is not getting much higher. Milo f*cks around, drugs around and kills and protects killers and puts the life of his fiancé on risk and when she gives him the chance to make a change, he lies to her and exploits her faith into him - thats all OK, it's Milo, it's the good guy, he can do all of this because he is a doctor. And that is what really annoys me: the ideology of the movie. The story is not realistic and according to it the police of New York must be blind and stupid because the crimes are so evident, that a 5 years old kid would find out who the murderers are after 1 day maximum. But who cares, lots of b-movies are stupid but enjoyable. Not this one. The most unpleasant slimy people are the elite in medicine and life and dead of other people is just a game. Being responsible must be the contrary of desirable. Mix it up with gore, gore is fashionable. All the pictures reminded me to ""CSI New York"", the pictures in the pathology as well as the view on the city, a show that bores me, but trust me, it is much better than this movie. Mix it with sex, sex sells. You have nothing to say, put a puppet of a nude Alyssa Milano in,and the guys will watch it. The cheap trick to get money for a horror movie at the level of an amateur porn. Very disappointing."
Kung Fu Panda             ,3xHCCH,0,animation,2008,10,"I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.The action and fight scenes are very well done and memorable. I enjoyed watching the fight scene between Po and Shifu for the last dumpling, the fight of the Five vs. Tai Lung at the Bridge, and the climactic fight scene of Tai Lung with Shifu, and then with Po. Very exciting. My daughter even spontaneously applauded after that last fight sequence.There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits.The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.Overall, a fantastic movie experience that I would not mind watching over and over. There is something for everyone -- action, drama, and comedy. It is an animated classic in my book. Very highly recommended indeed!"
Julia             ,richard_sleboe,1,crime,2008,6,"Elena, an AA regular, devises a wild scheme to abduct her estranged son, Tom, from his legal guardian, the boy's wealthy grandfather. While the plan is in progress, Elena's friend and accomplice Julia kidnaps Tom from his bodyguard to extort some money. The boy escapes, but Julia miraculously retrieves him from the salt flats of Southern California (or Arizona?). Mistaking a routine border patrol sweep for an LAPD manhunt, they accidentally cross into Baja California where the kid is promptly snatched by the Mexican mob. Sounds ludicrous? Totally. ""Julia"" is not a movie you will like for the plausibility of its plot. Its sole appeal is Tilda Swinton's amazing portrayal of a drunk, rising above the phlegm of intoxication to meet the challenges brought about by a near-nonsensical script. Although I liked the film, I think it's about an hour too long. The Tijuana episode is simply beyond belief"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,Chris Knipp,0,crime,2010,NA,"The ironically titled Danish film 'Terribly Happy' is the tale of a cop sent to serve as local Marshall in a remote border town in South Jutland called Skarrild that doesn't need cops or have much use for them. It's a place where nothing much happens. Ha! Well -- that's what they say. This part of the country, you don't know if you're coming or going. People use the same monosyllable, ""Mojn"" (pronounced ""moyn"") to say both ""hello"" and ""goodbye."" Men of few words, they are, these boozy locals, who like to settle scores their way, not ""by the book."" Klepto kids are just boxed brutally on the ears and sent packing. There's a bog that swallows up junk, sometimes a cow, maybe some darker secrets. This place is insular, mysterious, and weird. And a bog, like a pistol, once introduced, must be used.'Frygtelig lykkelig' (it sounds funnier in Danish) has its own rhythm and momentum, and a snappy style including a sound design that's sometimes explosive, sometimes ironic. The film's consistently effective, and has a unique feel, though at times its hodgepodge of genres and stylistic borrowings evokes Coen brothers (especially 'Blood Simple') and David Lynch work as it would be if the American auteurs had filmed in Danish in consultation with Aki Kaurismaki. A mix of psychological thriller, horror story, and neo-noir, it moves fast but also manages to take the time necessary to also be a mood piece in which the town vies with the cop for the role of protagonist.Here are the outlines, but the details have to be omitted because it's all in the surprises and twists. Robert Hansen (Jakob Cedergren) is the policeman from Copenhagen sent out here because he's had a mental breakdown some time ago. He has, shall we say, anger issues. ""You're working your way up?"" somebody says. Again: ha! He's in serious limbo. He looks convincing in his police uniform and has a modicum of leading man looks. But then again there's something a bit fuzzy about him too -- something a bit lost. He misses an estranged or divorced wife back home, and repeatedly tries to call her and a little daughter, but without results. He has messed up in some way, and this is a punishment assignment.Like many noir heroes, Robert comes on the scene already in trouble and immediately gets into more. A pretty but dicey blond called Ingerlise Buhl (Lene Maria Christensen), appears, saying her husband Jørgen (Kim Bodnia) has beaten her. She barges in on Robert the way many a dubious babe has appeared on a hapless noir detective's doorstep. It's not so much a domestic squabble complaint as an attempted seduction -- and instant jeopardy for Robert. He can't ignore Ingerlise but there's no safe way to deal with her. The local rule against outside ""by the book"" punishments is compounded by the fact that Jørgen turns out to be a scary dude, the town bully; also a man said to have fathered a number of children around town.The only kids we see are shoplifters corralled by the local grocer, whom Robert learns to smack as instructed rather than book (the kids, that is, not the grocer). And then there's the well-dressed Dorothe (Mathilde Maack), Ingerlise and Jørgen's little girl, who's often seen creepily pushing a big baby carriage around the town's empty, haunted streets with her teddy bear inside. It seems when bad stuff begins at home, she escapes by pushing the carriage. Funnily enough rumor has it she's not Jørgen's. You just don't know, around here.Genz toys with the unexpected in ways that transcend the film's various genres. These include the Western too, since Jørgen wears a ten-gallon hat and, as odd and menacing at times as Dennis Hopper's bad guy in 'Blue Velvet,' he winds up in a ""shoot out"" against Robert. Only, in truly Danish style, the shots exchanged are of whiskey, alternating with chugged bottles of beer. (Another bar regular's face is a dead ringer for Hopper's.)Robert's an outsider but it's never fully clear whether Skarrild wants to exclude him or lock him in forever as one of theirs. His tarnished rep appeals to them because the town's own morals are generally shaky. There's a running card game of the self-declared ""quack"" Dr. Zerlang (Lars Brygmann) and other local fixtures want Robert for a fourth at the card table. ""Everyone knows everything but says nothing"" about you in this town, is the rule, and so they know Robert's secrets when he arrives and soon know more in the nightmare Ingerlise and Jørgen force upon him, which he may eventually resolve, or make worse; he must let the town decide. The town has the last laugh, but so do we.Adapted from a novel by Erling Jepsen,'Terribly Happy' has been richly rewarded in Denmark for its skillful direction, cinematography, writing, and acting. Henrik Ruben Genz obviously had fun making this. It probably didn't hurt much that both he and Erling Jepsen are from the South Jutland region"
Saw V             ,thomascompton,0,crime,2008,1,"Slop. There' I'll say it. Trash, slop, gutter garbage. Dave Hackl has, in every course of thought, forethought, and even dreamlike subconscious, raped the Saw franchise. I don't mean like made it boring, or made it slow, no I mean made it incoherent, trashy, and completely illogical.I am a DIE HARD SAW FAN!! I will say that now. I LOVE SAW!!! But between little to no creative traps, absolutely terrible dialog, and the worst ending to a film since The Village (really the ending is that bad), I think it stands a testament how terrible of a director Dave is. Actually, come to think of it, I would have been happy with a M. night ending. What if...Jigsaw was really the number 5. And his witchery was the epitome of pure evil. And he had flying 8's that would ravage your children. That ending would have been better then what I just watched no more then 2 hours ago. I will not let this dreg sink in. Jigsaw is barely in the film, and so many VERY IMPORTANT questions are left unanswered, but not in a Saw way. Sort of like in a Clue or Jeopardy kind of way. It's like if Alex Tribek asked the question, nobody got it right, and then he didn't tell you the answer.The plot was horrible. The acting was bad. The last trap (involving hands) in the film was pretty good. The real last trap (that's not a trap, it's just uncreative and stupid) looked like something from a bad library book you steal just to resell it. Not good, not fair, not even terrible. If there is anything worse then abomination to Jim Jones, that is this film. God, Jim Jones couldn't even be this sadistic"
21             ,khaledhakim,0,crime,2008,NA,"Warning - may contain spoilers.I will make this very brief.Kevin Spacey... shame on you for accepting such a role.The movie was below the passing line and I would not watch it again on my deathbed if it meant it would keep me alive.What the screenwriters may have not kept in mind is that many of the viewers, those who would actually go and see the movie, may not have read the book or know of all the juicy details that have been left out of the movie. I had to figure out what the count of cards was on my own. It felt nice to have to use your brain a little to figure something out, but as I was reading other posts (comments) I learned that what I had figured out on my own was very primitive and much more elaboration would have made things clearer and given the movie a little more edge - although its pretty round edged to me.Why would the MIT professor be so cruel and mean and cold, to the point that he had to call the casino security which results in the beating of one of his ""brilliant"" students who had made him tons of money.How could that same professor so quickly be convinced in a scene of about 1 min and 45 seconds to go back to the table and play a ""last round"" with the same student he had screwed over and so openly called as a cunning genius... Did this professor lack intellect? This made no sense what so ever and was very unbelievable as something that a rational person would do.One thing to admit, the final twists were unpredictable.. but by that point I had already developed my own mind about the movie... Big fat failure. I'm ashamed I wasted my time watching it. I thought it would be good... I guess the next time I see spacey in a movie, I wont be able to take the movie off the shelf without questions asked as I once did."
Nim's Island             ,Jahala_Dudley,1,adventure,2008,6,"It was a cute movie. But, there were some parts that were 'too cute' to enjoy. Some of the animals used...though they were real, looked fake, cheesy, and unrealistic..like the bird.The seal was probably the most realistic acting animal and did a nice job. The lizards used in the film looked real but the the 'voices' they were given were way too cheesy and was the one thing that made them seem fake...although they got a giggle from the kids in the audience. Foster did a great job of portraying a character with agoraphobia, she hit it right on. The rest of the actors did quite well also, Breslin has proved herself to be a known name in the future. I definitely recommend this for the kids."
Mamma Mia!             ,aportilla,1,comedy,2008,1,"When Dante, Faust, Nietzsche and Kafka wrote about the solitude and despair of human existence, this is what they were actually writing about. Sitting there watching this movie made me feel alone in the world with no hope of rescue but for the inevitable end of this shrill musical.Do you remember when you saw a scary movie for the first time at a very early age and kept telling yourself that it was going to be over soon? Or when you looked into the closet at night and had to turn away because your mind couldn't take it? This is how I felt waiting for this movie to be over. It was simply the bottom of the barrel.I am not crazy about musicals to begin with and went to see it with two of my family members whom I knew would enjoy it on some level. I don't regret going because sometimes it's OK to see a movie with and for a friend. If you like musicals Im sure it wont traumatize you as it did me and anyway I suppose there's also nothing wrong with people singing and wanting to enjoy themselves...I just don't want to ever be a part of it if it's going to look and sound like this.

Garden Party             ,MBunge,1,drama,2011,NA,"It's not that Garden Party is badly made, just that it seems like this exact same movie has been made 3 or 4 times a year by 3 or 4 different indy filmmakers for the last 15 years. Is there some book out there that teaches people to write this same script as some sort of screen writing exercise? Is there something in the bottled water shipped into Los Angeles that makes people forget they've done this film over and over and over again? Is there some cursed videotape floating amongst the aspiring fringes of the movie industry where if you watch it, you see a girl climb out of a well and the only way to save your life is to write this same script and get it produced?Garden Party is about a bunch of fairly aimless people in LA whose lives are tangentially connected. Yes, one of them is a kid from the streets trying to break into show business. Yes, another is a gay kid from the Midwest. And yes, there's young girl running away from a broken home. No, there's really not much of a plot or a particular reason to give a crap about anything or anyone involved here. There is a moment about 2/3rds of the way through when things almost get a little interesting. Unfortunately, writer-director Jason Freeland is apparently allergic to drama, undermining and deflating the tension before the moment is halfway over.Our cast of characters includes April (Willa Holland), a young girl running away from a leering stepdad who has to turn to nude modeling for fast money; Sammy (Erik Scott Smith), a talented young musician who rises from homeless to budding pop star so fast and relatively painlessly it might make any real struggling singer/songwriter who watches this movie want to kill themselves; Todd (Richard Gunn), a wealthy artist with nothing better to do than masturbate to internet porn; Nathan (Alex Cendese), a blonde slab of beef whose Hollywood dreams have fizzled; Sally (Vinessa Shaw), a real estate agent who slips her clients marijuana as a sales technique; and Anthony (Patrick Fischler), a low-level pornographer who still quaintly uses an actual camera with film in 2008.The actors all do perfectly fine work. Vinessa Shaw gives the standout performance as a very benign version of a film noir temptress. She's sexy and smart but way too nice to people. The almost interesting part of the story is when Sally lures Todd into a scheme to get naked pictures of her removed from the internet, as if such a thing were possible. If this movie weren't so determined to avoid any sort of excitement, that might have been worth watching. As it is, the film sets up some drama and then completely undercuts any sense of danger or even conflict. Then it does it again, just in case you didn't get the point the first time.Garden Party is well directed and looks okay. The dialog isn't memorable but neither will it make you cringe or facepalm. It's really not a bad movie.The problem is that there've been so many low-budget films about ""tangentially connected people in city X"" that it's basically become a sub-genre, like torture porn or zombie movies. If you're going to add something to a sub-genre, you need to do something a little different with it. Garden Party never does. There's no reason to avoid this movie, but also no reason to watch this instead of one of the umpteen other versions of the same thin"
Flash of Genius             ,callanvass,0,misc,2010,3,"Flash Of Genius was almost unbearable to watch, due to how selfish and relentlessly stupid Bob Kearns was. Yes it's a great performance, yes the acting is good, But who would deprive there family of what they need or a huge amount of cash just to get recognized? I mean sometimes you know when it's enough. I felt Kearns deserved his fate, due to his selfish actions, and everything else, even if he was right.Bottom line. Flash of Genius is a well made movie, but a torturous experience to sit through. They build him up as an underdog, but they don't realize how awfully annoying Bob Kearns truly was. If you really wanna see for yourself, go ahead it's a well made movie, but be prepared to be yelling and screaming due to Kearn's selfishness and stubborn actions.3/"

La siciliana ribelle             ,gelman@attglobal.net,1,crime,2011,NA,"Only because more people will have seen ""Veronica Guerin,"" I cite that splendid film as an introduction to ""The Sicilian Girl."" The themes are similar -- true stories of young women who invite death by exposing murderous activities. In this case, Rita Atrria (Veronica D'Agostino), a 17 year old from a Sicilian village controlled by the Mafia, takes her story, documented by diaries she has been keeping for many years, to an anti-Mafia prosecutor, Paolo Borsellino (Gerard Jugnot) seeking vengeance for the murder of her father and brother, both of whom were themselves members of the Mafia. Rita's diaries confirm incidents which the police have tracked and lead to the arrest of her town's Mafia chieftains, including the ones who had her father and brother killed. To avoid spoiling the story, I will offer no more of the details except to say that Rita's revelations make both her and Borsellino targets for assassination. Ms. D'Agostino and Mr. Jugnot are excellent actors, and a number of other roles are very well done. The movie is exciting and well worth the two hours it takes to watch it. As with any of the movies based on a ""true"" story, one is left wondering where truth leaves off and fiction takes over. I can guess at the juncture, but for the most part ""The Sicilian Girl"" is very convincing"
Gomorrah             ,adamblake77,,crime,2008,10,"Just back from seeing this. Still a bit shell-shocked. First impressions that it's up there with the very best. The last scene in particular was worthy of Bunuel at his most vengeful. Yes, it's in that league. Very tough indeed. Not a trace of sentiment. Entirely plausible performances. Taut and highly original direction, documentary style. Some of the set locations are just jaw dropping - be they natural or man-made. Some brilliant touches - shots panning back to reveal an entirely different context, the camera lingering on facial expressions of those left behind by the action, or on fear, or shock. A devastating commentary on life amongst the poor in modern Italy, this is as far removed from even the best Hollywood gangster movies as it is possible to imagine. The only American comparison might be with Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" - but there you are invited to empathise with characters (especially the one played by Harvey Keitel) and it is still possible to romanticise De Niro's depiction of Johnny Boy. There are no such avenues offered here. The traditional gangster movie denouement is contemptuously thrown away in the first five minutes. Not for the fainthearted but if you appreciated Bunuel's ""Los Olividados"" or ""Pixote"" or ""Salaam Bombay"" then this is for you. 1"
Untraceable             ,texrangers31,1,crime,2008,7,"As I have stated before, I love scary movies even though I get frightened by everything. Untraceable caught my eye the first time I saw a trailer for it. The plot is very fast paced, and you will find yourself playing detective while watching. The best part of this movie is that it doesn't go for cheap scares, such as something jumping out or ominous music at key points in the film. If you can handle a little bit of gore, you should be fine. The ending won't blow you away, but you shouldn't be disappointed either. This is a solid film that isn't too scary, but it's no Muppet movie. Colin Hanks is solid as usual. The killer didn't quite meet my expectations on the creepy scale, but he is serviceable. "

Alas, it wasn't.Just about every sports cliché eventually appears. Further, the film is very slow and really doesn't show the development of Ernie. The movie has ambitions to be much more than a sports movie but doesn't realize any of them. You don't walk away knowing any more about what it was like to be black back in the 40's and 50's and what race relations were like.

The Brothers Bloom             ,dromasca,1,action,2009,6,"'The Brothers Bloom' could be the ultimate con story and a very fun film. It somehow fails on both missions without being a film lacking quality and some nice moments.The two brothers in the center of the story are world experts in cheating. They stage elaborate cons, their victims are rich people, so they do not and we do not feel to guilty about their tricks The principal moral aspect they have to deal with is that by playing roles as a profession they risk to lose their identity and when real feelings interfere relative to their victims they risk professional failure. When the younger brother Bloom (Adrien Brody) falls for the rich widow (Rachel Weisz) who proves to have talents of her own for ticks and crafts, it is clear that things will get complicated. The whole story plays on several layers of deception, and this is what the authors of the story built the whole film upon. The problem is that they are too many layers, and too many apparent and possible endings for this story, so that at the end when the real final happens the viewers will not carry or will refuse to get involved, fearing that it's another con ending.We are left with exquisite acting. Adrien Brody plays on the tragic and pathetic register all along the film, maybe a little bit too pathetic to be totally genuine. His melancholic look spreads all over the movie, but as we know his cabotine sadness is also a professional trick we end by asking ourselves at any moment whether it is totally genuine. Rachel Weisz is beautiful and sophisticated and has good chemistry with Brody. The acting revelation is however Mark Ruffalo as the older, rough but deeply caring brother. He is touching and he does look sincere if there is such thing as a sincere crook, and gives credibility to the slightly incredible ending. Rinko Kikuchi completes the quartet in the almost completely speechless role of the con men assistant, kind of Japanese female Q (as in the Bond movies).The film has a lot of literary and musical references that can be watched and liked if you know the nuances. It's many good pieces are however enveloped in a story that tries to be too sophisticated. A somehow more easier touch in directing and perhaps a simplified story line could have made of this film the really fun film we expected."

I didn't watch the 3D version which appears to have had a lot of nice depth effects to take your mind off of the very weak storyline chocked full of filler.

Summer Hours             ,tieman64,1,drama,2010,NA,"""Summer Hours"" begins, appropriately, with hordes of children running joyfully through a garden. They're on a treasure hunt, following a map written in invisible ink.Director Olivier Assays then introduces us to Helene Berthier, an elderly woman whose children and grandchildren have gathered at her home in rural France. Helene was once romantically linked to a character called Paul, a now dead artist who was renowned for his paintings.Helene's home is filled with both Paul's work (a vast collection of priceless art) and more mundane personal items which nevertheless have tremendous sentimental value. One photograph, for example, features an older generation of Berthiers sitting at a table exactly as the current generation are. As the film unfolds, Assayas lays the groundwork for various heavy themes: the way what we ""treasure"" changes as we age, how art and objects tie people to the past, the relationship between art, globalisation and commerce, the seemingly arbitrary and shifting ""value"" of objects, the question of what defines art and what makes art meaningful, how spaces are ""deterritorialized"" and ""reterritorialized"" under capitalism, how objects transform as they move from space to space etc etc. You might say this is the ""rural"" version of Assayas's ""Demonlover"", ""Clean"" and ""Boarding Gate"", but whilst those films focused on the way humans are stripped, sold, traded and pushed around under techno-capitalism, ""Summer Hours"" focuses almost entirely on man's fluctuating relationship with both inanimate objects and product.Early in the film, Helene reveals the reason for calling a family assembly: she wants to discuss the fate of the family estate after her death. Frederic, Helene's eldest son, is an economist, and is the only family member who wishes (for sentimental reasons) to hold on to the estate and its artwork. Daughter Adrienne (a product designer) and younger son Jeremie (who works for a mega corporation in Shaghai) both want to sell the estate. It's of no value to them, they won't be able to visit it as they work far abroad, and it simply isn't economical to maintain. Frederic doesn't agree with them at first, but gradually the practical needs of commerce infringe on his desire to hold on to the past. Reluctantly he agrees with them. Significantly, Adrienne, the product of a system which destroys the past and sells nostalgic copies, makes tacky ceramic ornaments based on the designs of her uncle. Assayas stresses that the children are all ultra-modern bourgeois, part of a ""new France"" that is beholden to the demands of the global market and that is gradually losing ties with its traditions and heritage. Casual remarks highlight this theme: characters speaking of new companies popping up in their village, once taboo romantic relationships accepted as the norm, the fact that Adrienne lives in two of the citadels of Global Capitalism (New York and Japan), the fact that Jeremie is moving his family to China to better manage a mass production shoe factory and the mention that Jeremie's children will learn English and not speak French (thereby cutting them off from their cultural roots). Ironically, it's the one economist in the family who can't cope with the way his family, culture and historical treasure trove are being torn apart. Frederic frequently states that he believes the ""economy as a functional system"" is a myth. He recognises that economism is the new global religion, in which the world is reordered in the service of irrational and incessant growth. The dominant theology of this religion is neo-liberalism, which aims to make the whole world a single market, national boundaries no longer a factor in economic affairs. Unlike most religions, economism looks to growth for salvation, salvation being ""freedom"" from poverty and the ills that accompany it. When it is pointed out that the ""new religion"" has not in fact done much toward reducing poverty, believers are told that they must be more faithful to the precepts of the religion. Of course while the believers wait, the machine's greed outgrows the capacity of the real economy to satisfy. In response, the great centres of finance get the governments of the world to make available to them, by privatisation, all of their possessions. But still this does not suffice! How could it? Debt based Ponzi schemes cannot be satiated. And so the market becomes increasingly abstract, debts ignored or traded as ""value"" whilst virtual economies balloon to something like five times the size of the ""real"" economy. The end result is the world Assayas' characters find themselves in: groundless and always moving to keep the whole sham from collapsing.In one scene, Frederic proudly displays paintings for his children, telling them that one day the collection will be all theirs. But though his kids look up at the artwork with indifference, implying that they are ""cut off"" from the ""treasures of the past"", Assayas is careful to show that Frederic is himself deluded, unable to look upon the pictures without bias. His pleasure is clearly less about the aesthetic qualities of art/past, than it is about family legacy, memory and the continuation of a family history. His children, able to look at the paintings without bias, simply dismiss them as old-fashioned. The result is that the film manages to mourns the obliteration/repackaging of the past whilst also questioning if anything is really being lost. Does the worth of an object reside only in the historical and familial remembrances of concerned individuals?The film ends with a sequence which mirrors its first shot. Here Helene's granddaughter looks on at the abandoned family home, trying but failing to position her body such that it recreates a ""painting of the place"" that Paul once did. It's a deeply sad ending; no longer connected by shared place or possessions, the modern subject is both adrift and defined by loss. 8.9/10  A great film, though perhaps too word oriente"

Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,kosmasp,0,animation,2010,7,"There are movies that only (or more likely) work when you watch them with children. Or with your inner child being on. This is no Pixar and nowhere near it of course. But it's still a nice little movie, that succeeds in letting us into a world where flies can be heroes. Of course no kid will want their parents to buy them flies after that ... And of course, the flies do not look anything like real flies. There are quite a few animated movies out there, where science was thrown out for fantasy ... same happens here.The 3-D is decent enough, but it's more the dialogue and the characters that might convince to watch this and like it. On the other hand, I can see that some people will find it ""too patriotic"". But I do think, that it plays clever on the whole old rivalry, the two (former) most powerful countries had.

Ghost Town             ,reinbeauchaser-1,0,misc,2008,5,"Until Sunday night watching the Emmy's, I hadn't a clue who Gervais was. Ricky's routine about his 'missing' award from the previous year had me in stitches, though, so come Monday - when my adult son and I decided to take in Ghost Town - I was really looking forward to seeing the movie.I have to agree with one poster who said the first half was very funny, although there were times I wanted to slap Gervais' character with a 2 by 4. He was impertinently rude. A person I would loath to meet, regardless of 'where'. Yet, given the kind of movie this was, Gervais' style of wit fit perfectly.*SPOILER ALERT*And the routine between him and the admitting nurse at the hospital was hilarious. I mean, really - they do ask the most mundane and unrelated questions. Who cares what a person does for a living if they're going in for one of THOSE procedures, right. Oh, and the previous scene, with Gervais staring at the three bottles of - whatever it was? Hilarious! My mother had to endure two such events and I remember all too well how she would dash to the restroom after downing her trio of white stuff. I vowed never to have one done, not ever. Gervais did a great job with that part.Still, the theme, unique in some areas, was a bit too redundant overall, at least for me. In defense of Ghost Town, however, I think it would be near impossible to come up with a script so unique that it can stand alone.Suffice it to say, the movie was at time enjoyable, but it did seem to lose a bit of steam once Gervais' character became interested in Tea Leoni's.*END SPOILER ALERT*And I have to say that Tea turned out an excellent performance for the limited script they gave her. Greg Kennar, as well, did a great job as her jerky but very dead husband.I did enjoy the turn-about of Gervais' character, too; that said a lot without being preachy.Nevertheless, I can't say that my sides were hurting from too much laughing - and I was so hoping to do a lot of laughing. I think it could have been funnier and more spontaneous - and shorter. It was about twenty minutes too long. Had they kept it under 1.5 hours, I think they would have had a knockout winner.In summary, Ricky's intro into the world of movies was enjoyable enough and I look forward to his next project. I recommend it only if you like romantic comedies with a side of sarcasm."
Righteous Kill             ,pritish-sai,0,crime,2008,8,"Most people (including yours truly) are anxious to see this film cause its been 13 years since the two screen legends have appeared in the same movie. First and Foremost the movie delivers on the hype. Deniro is there and Pacino is there n from the start till the end they OWN the movie.The movie's strong point is that the two legends are back to the their roots .Witty wise cracks ,top notch swearing ,drugs and violence. Pacino is as brilliant as he was in his previous movies but when compared to heat he dosen't show the same energy that he did. DeNiro on the other hand was everything that made him what he is today . One of the immortals Deniro kicks a$$ and with Pacino there the duo literally tear the movie apart . Its superb.As far as the story goes the plot was nothing new but the twists and turns are highly innovative . Its like a an old 70's crime story with more modern elements. Curtis Jackson surprisingly did an above average job despite the fact that I thought that he would screw up. However when talking about the other acting its just bland cause you know why.Overall an enjoyable film. Definitely worth watching at least once. But I still feel that these guys have a lot left in them and I am eagerly waiting for them to team up again for another movie. "
The Merry Gentleman             ,aban1980,,crime,2012,10,"As other reviews have pointed out, this is a movie which should be seen and experienced, instead of reading reviews and narratives about it. This is one of the most enchanting and underrated movie that I have ever seen. It simply transcends movie-making to another level. It is evident that Keaton is a sensitive director, and daring in the sense that he does not try to hide this fact.The characters of the movie have depth. Breathtaking cinematography coupled with an amazing soundtrack makes this movie enjoyable. Where this movie stands out from the usual fare is that it does not try to build up a story or a narrative, instead the characters go with the flow with no attempt to explain any quirks along the way. Which is how life actually is!Kudos to Keaton for bringing out such a wonderful film. I wish I could treat myself to this movie for the first time agai"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,guylover_caroline,1,misc,2008,2,"The Other Boleyn Girl probably marks the debut of an adaptation of the most intriguing tale of English Royal history. However, very poorly does the film actually describe the events. I must say that probably the only accurate part of this movie is the inevitable ending--which I won't give away because there may be a few who don't actually know what happens.I am quite the Anne Boleyn fanatic. She is one of my favorite historical figures due to her intelligence, wit and ambition. But this film completely let me down. Obviously Ms. Gregory and the people working on the film are partial to Mary Boleyn, for they idolize her throughout and scorn Anne. What for? Mary Boleyn was a naive and vain young woman who only wished for the king's attention for as long as any ordinary mistress could have it. She was unintelligent. Anne, however, used strategy to get what she wanted. She did not wish for love (perhaps not a noble thing, but at least she was honest about it); she wished for power. And she got it. Because of her refusals, she became Queen of England. It was only her growing ego and ambition that destroyed her--quite the theme; however the writers ignored it and decided to go with the cliché ""love conquers all."" Of course that is a noble truth, but Anne's downfall is much more interesting. I recommend reading her biography and the (somewhat fictional) diary by Carolyn Meyer.The one thing I despised about this movie was how terribly inaccurate it was. Not only was it shown that one sister was favored over another by the writers, but also the historical portion was completely wrong. For one, Anne Boleyn was not the elder, more social and beautiful of the two. On the contrary, Mary was older by two or three years, and she was welcomed in by society because of her beauty and popularity. Anne was younger, darker, and she had two imperfections: A mole on her neck (believed to be Devil markings) and a sixth finger on her right hand. When she went to France she learned how to cover these imperfections and make herself seem flawless. Her wit was always present. And although I adore Eric Bana, he was a poor choice to play Henry VIII, one of the most morbidly obese men in all of history.Also, it is quite evident throughout that Anne was vying for Henry's affections all along; however, Mary was the one who wanted to be his mistress. Anne was busy with a poet and musician in court until Henry began to take interest in her. Perhaps because I am partial to Anne I found this movie so horrible. But I understand that she was a flawed human being who fell because of her ego. Still, the movie represented almost all of the characters horribly exaggerated. Anne was too bad, Mary was too good, Henry was too brutal, etc. I believe the only accurate characters in the film were the girls' mother, father, and uncle. their parts were true to history and made for an interesting relationship to follow. I suppose I don't see the necessity of changing fact to fiction. The true story is already interesting enough. Even if the writers etc. have differing opinions there are many ways to illustrate a character as good or evil without altering history. People need to learn that history itself is a story that needs to be told ACCURATELY. It makes more sense, it's more believable, and it's much more entertaining for people like me who obsess over such inconsistencies. Historical Accuracy aside, the movie was way too melodramatic for my tastes. there were no redeeming qualities other than the fact that Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen really understood their characters. Kudos for playing not just an historical figure, but also for playing another person's opinion of an historical figure. It is not always easy. the action was very repetitive, and most of it not very good. I'm sorry, but I'd have to say no on this one. Even if you don't care about historical authenticity, the movie itself isn't great.If you do care about the facts?? Run away. Fast."
35 Shots of Rum             ,Pan32,0,drama,2010,NA,"35 Shots of Rum (35 Rhums), Claire Denis, 2008, continues Denis' portrayal of Europeans of African ancestry with this quietly unfolding parable of a daughters deep love of her father and his pangs of guilt in accepting her companionship (he is a widower) which he comes to see is an unhealthy dependency preventing her from forming her own emotional life with her boyfriend. The scene is a Parisian apartment building in which Jo and her father Lionel share friendships with Noe, Jo's boyfriend, and Gabrielle, a single woman who drives her own taxi. The obvious parings are prevented from developing by Jo'e inertia brought on by her contentment with the arrangement and the resolution hinges on the death of Noe's cat and the discovery of by Jo of a note from Gabrielle to Lionel. The films attractions are the expected artistry of Cinematographer Agnes Godard and the deft direction of Denis in which emotions and attitudes are conveyed with great economy. Denis uses imagery of movement throughout the film as Lionel is a commuter train engineer who uses a motorcycle for personal transport; Gabrielle drives her taxi; and Jo rides trains to her classes. There is a brief moment of something like magic realism with Jo and her father on horse back galloping down the underground tracks. All this contrasts with the quiet lives at the apartment. One odd note is the depiction of Jo at classes where the subject of the monetary domination of the northern countries over the southern. The word revolution is mentioned and a brief scene of a protest is inserted art one point. This contrasts, consciously or not, with a decidedly up scale apartment with furnishings that suggest a background far different from a train engineer.

21             ,JustCuriosity,0,crime,2008,7,"This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen. It's an interesting story, but they could have edited down a bit to make it move a little quicker. This is a good film, but it probably could have been a lot better. "
Pride and Glory             ,hb-boyd,,crime,2008,7,"I saw the advance screening of Pride and Glory last night in NYC. It's an excellent film despite the first 30 minutes, which is riddled with enough F-bombs ((classic Collin Farrell)) and Spanish speaking between characters ((no subtitles!)) to make you question whether you'll ever understand what's happening on screen. It's not until after the 30 minute mark that the storyline is finally spelled out for those of us who can't cut through all the nonsense at the start. Thanks to outstanding performances by Edward Norton and Jon Voight this is definitely a MUST see film. All the action will literally have you on the edge of your seat towards the end. However, I'd advise you to spend the first 30 minutes doing something more productive with your time like standing outside in the concession line for popcorn and candy. In the bathroom washing your hands. Maybe on your cell phone having a conversation with your mother would be less punishment than watching the poor set up of this cop flick. But do go out and see this film!!! Just be sure to leave the kids at home, because the profanity, nudity and violence was even a bit too much for some of the adults in the audience. Enjoy."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,sergepesic,1,misc,2011,9,"Late 60's and 70's were tumultuous in both USA and Western Europe. Extremely conservative governments were completely out of touch with the liberal young population, and, of course, the result was catastrophic.Fighting the communists was the only order of the day, and in that battle the West went to bed with a lot of unsavory characters. We are still paying for some of those moronic decisions. This brilliant movie follows the tragic outcome of this rigid governing. Using the logical anger and discontent of the Western youth, some people with their own issues and agendas abducted their political goals and unleashed the terrorist horror on West Germany.

It's not ""Schndler's List"" and it never tries to be. It's very dark and nihilistic but it never goes over the top. It's fun, sick and twisted entertainment and if you're more into those kind of movies then you'll enjoy it a lot. If your favorite movie is ""Atonemnet"", I recommend to skip it.I thought the performances - especially by Michael Weston - were great, it looked stylish and had an overall creepy atmosphere. Good special effects and the ending was really good too. Overall: Really great movie. "
35 Shots of Rum             ,Chris Knipp,0,drama,2009,NA,"Alex Descas ('Late August, Early September,' 'Boarding Gate') stars with Denis perennial favorite the ('Variety'says) ""sexy, soulful"" Grégoire Colin; plus Mati Diop, Nicole Dogue, and Jean-Christophe Folly in a deceptively simple-seeming film about a group of apartment neighbors and coworkers, mostly black. Lionel (Descas), an RER train conductor, has raised his daughter Josephine (Diop) alone since she was a little girl. She's grown up now, a student at the faculty of anthropology who works in a music shop. They live together as a couple, each caring more for the other than for anybody else but increasingly realizing this doesn't make sense any more. Neighbor and ex-girlfriend Gabrielle (Dogue) still evidently hankers after Lionel. Noé (Colin), also down the hall, lives in the cluttered apartment of his deceased parents, goes on long rips, and hankers after Jo. They're all stuck. And all very close to each other.The engines of the plot are the retirement of one of Lionel's longtime coworkers and friends; a party; a missed concert; a bad storm; a funeral; and the death of Noé's 17-year-old cat.Denis' special touch shows in her handling of family intimacy, the way a routine event can suddenly shift into a life-changing moment. The apartment block seems ordinary and mundane but the relationships resonate from the first shots. A car that breaks down in the rain leads to a party in a closed bar with music that lights up the theater. A long stare into a woman's eyes speaks volumes. A pair are jogging on a wet day and the guy jumps in the river on a whim. His cat dies and Noé decides to move to Gabon. And an extra rice cooker taken out of its box means a new start. Almost everything is communicated with faces and very little exposition or dialogue.It's interesting how the chameleon Grégoire Colin blends in with the black people. His own face seems stained and tawny, his look gypsy-like and sly. He slips in and out of some of Denis' films almost casually, seemingly unnecessary yet essential, mysterious yet making them more real. Here he reappears at the end almost phantom-like, after he seemed to have left. Music, rain, trains, and a motorcycle become symbols of change.After the group has been established, especially the intimacy between Lionel and Jo, comes the retirement of fellow trainman René (Julieth Mars Toussaint), which leads to the ""35 rum shots"" evening--but Lionel stops short, saying the occasion doesn't warrant going to the whole 35. René is sad and lost without his work to define him. He speaks grimly of living to 100, but will come to a tragic end after appearing alone at a bar the group frequents and taking a sad ride in an RER engine car with Lionel.Then comes the concert, the car breakdown, and the impromptu, and wonderful, party in the bar the group persuades the owners to reopen. There are jealousies--Lionel's disapproval of Noé's intimate dancing with Jo; Gabrielle's of Lionel's dancing with the beautiful café owner (Adele Ado); but the warmth of the group is confirmed in this subtle, intense sequence.Sequences in which Jo disputes socio-political issues and Franz Fanon in a university class and is approached by fellow student Ruben (Jean-Christophe Folly) at the music shop (he invites her too late to the concert and gives her a romantic bouquet with a note) are a bit more artificial and expository but help show Jo'e developing life away from her father. There's also a trip to Germany that shows who Lionel's wife (and Jo's mother) was. But this is explanation that only shows us how much we don't know.Denis mostly, as usual, makes us do the work, but the job isn't as tricky or complicated as in her previous (and remarkable) 'The Intruder.' This film seems like the essence of what good contemporary French film-making is about: the subtle surface, the hidden depths behind ordinary appearances, the shifting amber lights in soft dawns and sunsets by Denis' consummate DP Agnes Godard; the rain, the warm café. I'm indebted to the review by 'Variety's' Jay Weisberg for pointing out that the original music is by the Tindersticks, and the enveloping song in the bar is the Commodores' ""Nightshift""; and he also points wisely to the importance of Judy Shrewsbury's costume designs, which are notably lovely in the case of Adel Ado's dark red dress in the bar and the white sheath-like one worn by Mati Diop for a funeral--the occasion when Lionel finally drinks the 35 shots of rum.'35 Shots of Rum'/'35 Rhums' opens in Paris February 19, 2009; part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, New York, March 2009.

Continually disappointing, derivative, unimaginative thriller filmed in washed-out winter-blues and grays, crippled by an endlessly-protracted finale.

Step up 2 features cool dance moves but the plot is so simple. But it is a dance movie, we should be watching it for its dance moves not some good plot. Step up 2 features some of the most coolest dance moves. When I was watching it, I was wondering how did they do all the moves. The dance moves are amazing.

This film was perfectly suited for children of ALL ages!The characters were a bit silly, but how could you not love a talking dog of any kind? There was actually a plot to this story which is sometimes missing in animated films. I found myself actually rooting for the characters. Knowing how people are with their ""little"" dogs, I enjoyed the fashion show!

Yes Man             ,dead47548,0,comedy,2008,8,"Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboyism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy.I'm so sorry, I had to say it. 2"
Frost/Nixon             ,alexkolokotronis,0,misc,2009,8,"Frost/Nixon was indeed a good movie but the question is ""will it stand the test of time?"". I seriously doubt it. The performances are admirable and the writing is very good but I was not overly impressed compared to other movies I have seen.The acting was good throughout the cast. Frank Langella was good but not spectacular as Richard Nixon. In my mind I will have Anthony Hopkins as Nixon not Langella. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. This I had a problem with, I liked the approach of him not being shown as an evil man but I did not like the fact he appeared to better than he was. I felt that Michael Sheen stole the show from Langella and in fact played better than him. His performance was more diverse and versatile and of course the movie is about him interviewing Nixon not Nixon interviewing Frost.The directing was solid as usual of Ron Howard. Yet with the character of Nixon he seemed to be pushing the idea of sympathy upon us for Richard Nixon. When it comes to feeling emotions such as sympathy, it should not be pushed upon you. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. The nice quick dialog between the characters is what really set the tone of the film above all.I liked Frost/Nixon but it is not a powerful movie. It sets a good tone at the beginning and stays with it throughout. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness. It does have moments of greatness and a few memorable scenes but not enough to really stand the test of time. I do not believe it deserves its best picture, best director or best actor nominations as other men and movies have had more powerful and affecting influence this year."

Keanu Reeves plays the role perfectly in his stunning performance as Tom Ludlow. Forest Whitaker gives an awesome supporting performance as Wander.Although there are a few rap artists in this film, they each play street thugs, which is not a far stretch.The best film I have seen in theaters for a LONG time, yet I feel it will be overlooked by most.Street Kings is an instant classic!!!! -Mike 2"

It makes OK movies like The Grudge look like masterpieces. First, the one and only good thing about this movie was it built decent suspense in some parts. That being said, the pay off was horrible. We would always get some bad CGI, a copy off of something that was in another movie(1408 is a clue), or an average death that is filmed horribly just so that the movie won't be R. The character development is THE WORST I have seen in any movie, and thats including all the very low budget horror movies. The detective doesn't have a personality, he's just kind of a machine that spits out dialog. The main character is so stupid, its unbelievable. There have been unintentionally stupid characters throughout time, but none have been so stupid that I had to shake my head at them. The side characters are worse. You just remember them as hot Latin chick, guy friend, and the other friend. Of course, that means you don't care for their deaths. The plot was pretty stupid, they just shove some random crap in their so they could have an ending. When the film ends, it made me mad because they took too long to show credits, so you think something else will happen, but then the credits just roll. And if the screenwriter had a brain, he would know that cell phones aren't scary, its the idea of hearing your own death. But of course, we just have to have a cell phone in every scene, and this ruins what could be some good scares. On one last note, there was a really embarrassing scene that we're supposed to take serious, but you just laugh your head off at the stupidity. Overall, a 3/10 1"
I Sell the Dead             ,hinesgtrservice,,misc,2009,9,"This film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of Hollywood crap I've seen recently. The acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing. There really isn't much to the story, it's simple and it works well. An easy film to just sit down and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals. The film obviously has aspects of horror, yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things. You won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one, but you'll be smiling the whole way through. The humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt. I really watched this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a bit smaller than I expected, but it doesn't matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged. If you like horror, watch this. If you like comedies, watch this. Just go ahead and watch this anyway, it's really quite excellent."

The Burning Plain             ,Otoboke,1,misc,2009,NA,"Cause harm repeatedly to most parts of the body and they eventually grow desensitised, calloused and indifferent to the pain over time. This dispassionate, earthy and very dry aesthetic that film-maker Guillermo Arriaga applies to the world of his first major directorial outing is king; between the barren desert landscapes that permeate within the backdrops of his strangely distant and out-of-sync characters and the sparse narrative that intertwines it all together, The Burning Plain views life as a series of scarscold and unrepresentative of the pain that brought them to the surface, but a firm reminder as such that nothing ever quite goes away, no matter how far you run. For the characters of Arriaga's story, a central catastrophe of sorts serves as the unfortunate catalyst that will bring them all together whether they like it or not. A burning trailer, housing two lovers sharing a passionate affair behind their families back, exploding in a rage of flames seemingly caused by accident. For them, the movie opens with their death thus absolving them from living with their irrevocable actions, but for those they leave behind the past stays as a constant and dictates largely how each of their futures will develop.Serving as a somewhat humbled character piece that centres on a small group of intertwining stories between the two conflicted families, The Burning Plain is an unassuming and dry landscape of drama. For the majority of the feature, the movie is split between three narratives, most of which take place over different timelines told in a back-and-forth manner which informs but never confuses the viewer as to where each of these characters are going, and where they have been. This multi-layered and contorted style that Arriaga implements here can obviously get a little confusing at times, yet enough care is taken to allow each of the stories to have their own breathing room. As a result, the characters which take centre stage feel nicely developed and humansomething integrally important to a story such as Arriaga's. In the end, while it seems that some plot developments never seem to be heading to any sort of meeting point, there exists a sort of catharsis and closure to the movie that ties everything together nicely, but perhaps too nicely. The ending is somewhat dubious, but nevertheless feels like the logical step when taken in retrospect.As mentioned in the opening paragraph, a central theme to Arriaga's feature here is the suppression of emotionof a cool, collected and strangely alien approach to relationships with other people. While there are plenty of moments where the director opts to balance such instances out with moments of palpable passion (most of which occur between the two burning lovers), the dominant motif here is that callous and introverted sense of misdirection and ambivalence that plays such a major part in a few of the central characters' stories. The performances then, which can be hard to grasp on to as a result, nevertheless do well to keep things human without ever sacrificing that uniquely cold tone. This isn't a feature that will immediately grasp you with its story or characters, and the performances from the cast are very much the same. Instead The Burning Plain opens up as it goes along, eventually climaxing in a series of finely performed expulsions of emotion. It is in this final act that much of Arriaga's story comes together and pieces fall into place, so it's appropriate that much of the movie's most cathartic, and warmer shades transpire here.For The Burning Plain to truly come off the screen however, one has to feel for the characters that dominate the screenplay from the get-go, which unfortunately is not the case. While it is certainly evident that Arriaga's crafts an interesting and somewhat unique presentation to an otherwise familiar story thanks to his callous approach to much of the proceeding drama, the movie too often falls a little short of its intended destination thanks to the overly cold opening and unsurprising ending. The result is a feature which definitely succeeds in offering two hours of finely plotted drama, but which also fails at making any more of an impression. The characters are compelling in their own strange way, the narrative complicated but not to the extent that all hope is lostfor those two elements alone I could recommend The Burning Plain to viewers and that's not even taking into account the performances and imagery in twine. In the end however, Arriaga doesn't quite reach where he tries to; The Burning Plain is and enjoyable and rewarding experience, but it lacks the extra zest needed to carry it on through to something more profound and memorable.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
Bedtime Stories             ,DarkVulcan29,0,adventure,2008,8,"It is nice to see Adam Sandler rise back from the ashes, after the summers big disaster You Don't Mess The Zohan, it seems these days he can take a hit or a miss in strive.The story centers around Skeeter(Adam Sandler), an down on his luck hotel repair man, is asked to babysit his sisters(Courtney Cox) kids at night, while her friend(Keri Russell) watches them during the day, while she goes away for a week at a few job interviews. One night before putting them to bed, he decides to tell them a made up depressing story, semi based on his own life, but the kids change it, and make it more happy. Then the next day, the events described in the made up fantasy, begin to start happening in real life. Is it just a strange case of Deja Vu, or is there something magical in the works?Now imagined if Walter Mitty, fantasies actually start coming true. It's nice to see Adam Sandler not over perform with his comedy for once with his comedy. He has such funny one liners, and delivers them with perfect timing. And he and Keri Russell play off each other well. It's nice to see serious actor Guy Pearse play up against Adam Sandler, and he is also good as Sandlers nemesis. It has great effects also, and great slapstick too. A terrific magical tale for all ages."
Mamma Mia!             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,comedy,2008,8,"With this big opening weekend either you're going to see the darker film The Dark Knight or you are going to see something more light hearted like Mamma Mia! Now I work at a movie theater, a lot of people were just assuming that everyone was going to see The Dark Knight, yesterday someone came up disappointed saying ""my show sold out""... I looked at her with a smiling face and said ""oh, yeah, dark knight, I know""... she said ""no, mamma mia"", I looked up all surprised, Mamma Mia sold out as well, people were really looking forward to this movie as well. I did see this movie on Saturday and really enjoyed it, as cheesy as it was, I do enjoy musicals, I think the only thing is that this this is the happiest musical that I have ever seen. So it was nice to just sit there and be happy with these characters and you can't help but laugh at the predicaments that they get themselves into.Sophie is a young woman who is about to tie the knot with her loving and adventurous fiancée, Sky, her life is great. She has a very loving mother, Donna, who is running a broke down hotel in Greece and used to be in a girl group called The Donna's. Sophie has one problem, she has never met her dad, she finds her mom's diary and discovers that she has three potential fathers. She invites them all to the wedding putting her mom's name on the invitation. So the three men: Sam, Harry, and Bill come to see her and Sophie is caught in a situation where she doesn't know who's her real dad, but they end up having the time of their lives and enjoying life together.Mamma Mia is the light hearted comedy that I'm sure any musical lover could enjoy. I loved how well paced it was and how the cast looked like they had the ultimate time making this film, that's what made it so much fun. This film also brings a lot of fun energy into you and just keeps you smiling. The songs were very catchy, which I know this musical was based on the songs of Abba, so we have that good old 70's groove going on. I would recommend Mamma Mia, if you're looking to smile, laugh, and dance, I'm sure you'll love to see Mamma Mia. It's a sweet film with the cheesy plot that is so much fun to laugh at, plus it has men in speedo's who are dancing like crazy, where can you go wrong with that? OK, you can, but it's all good.8/10"
The Square             ,chariot6,0,crime,2008,10,"Written by Joel Edgerton and Matthew Dabner, directed by Nash Edgerton and produced by Louise Smith, The Square eloquently shows that Australian films can embrace genre in an exciting, audience-aware way. This is thrilling film-making at its best.The plot revolves around a middle aged man, Ray, (David Roberts) who makes a fatal mistake when he gets involved with younger woman, Carla, (Claire van der Boom). His attempts to make it right just land him deeper and deeper into the kind of trouble he'll never be able to resolve. This searing examination of middle-aged angst and displaced desire keeps the surprises coming and the twists turning.In a series of colourful and dynamic performances, the supporting cast including Joel Edgerton as a pyromaniac crim-for-hire, Tony Hayes as the spurned husband with a dark secret of his own and Kieran Darcy-Smith as a nasty concrete guy only add to the strength of the world.Beautifully shot, fantastic production design and razor sharp editing. Also of note is the soundtrack - perfectly tuned to mood - this one doesn't miss a beat. This was my highlight of the Sydney Film Festival - audiences should flock to this one.They won't be disappointed."
Righteous Kill             ,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,0,crime,2008,7,"FINALLY! DeNiro! Pacino! Together! For more than one scene! I couldn't wait. I'm also happy to say that, while the film won't be winning any Oscars, it isn't bad by any means, and is certainly an improvement over Pacino and director Jon Avnet's last film, 88 Minutes. Avnet is growing as a filmmaker, and has learned from past mistakes. Righteous Kill is an acceptable mystery film, and of course, features two great performances from two of the greatest of all time.Righteous Kill, despite having the two leads that it does, is really a director's film, and Jon Avnet cloaks the film in a black blanket of mystery very well. While the main plot twist of the film (and oh, there are many of them) is sort of obvious, the fact that there's more to it than that really helps the film and saves it from oblivion.What I liked most about the film, however, was the casting of DeNiro in a role Pacino would normally play (the hotheaded cop who just can't seem to keep his mouth shut or stop cursing), and Pacino in a role DeNiro would normally play (the reserved, yet silently intense friend). The film is split up into two parts, each showcasing the talents of one of the legends. Unfortunately, I can't really describe the performances in a deep way without coming close to spoilers, but rest assured, both are excellent. John Leguizamo is a nice addition as a hot headed detective at odds with DeNiro, and Carla Gugino as the eye candy was not a mistake by any means. I have no comment on the inclusion of 50 Cent in this film. Thankfully, he doesn't have a ton of screen time.The script of the film, on paper, isn't really good, but there's a few techniques that really work on screen, such as the main characters' nicknames, and the feeling that almost everyone in the film is bad. I definitely like Avnet a little more now. DeNiro and Pacino share a wealth of screen time and have a lot of meat to chew on as actors, especially DeNiro, who turns up the intensity and the New York accent (it's a little stronger here than it normally is). While the film won't go down as legendary, I think every fan of both actors will be pleased and will smile at numerous moments just because these two are playing off each other so often, and so well.My complaints lie with the emotional feel of the film, which I felt wasn't strong enough. I wanted to shed tears in the end, but for some reason, I couldn't. I won't say the acting in the climax could have been stronger, but had it been done in a different way, I might have liked it a bit more. All in all, Righteous Kill is not a bad film, as it managed to keep my attention and hold me in suspense for it's duration without making me feel frustrated. It definitely requires your full attention, and may even require a couple of viewings. 1"
Saw V             ,ruddaga,0,crime,2008,4,"**Review Written With Possible Spoilers** So i just saw Saw 5. And how to sum it up.. I think my brother summed it up best as ""One long ass prologue for Saw 6.""Now i remember the first saw being one of the best films I've ever seen. Saw 2 was a major let down to me.. it was just too random and didn't have the calculated brilliance of Saw 1. Saw 3, i actually didn't mind, just because i found it more interesting then Saw 2. Saw 4 was pushing it but i kept on watching just cause all the little questions that had built up over the series had to be answered otherwise i couldn't sleep at night.. So we come to Saw 5... And what HUGE revelation do we get in this movie? ...... Well... actually we don't get one. Oh sure there is the back story of how Hoffman became the new saw killer.. But its so cheesy that a 6th grader could've strung it all together. And the story isn't...well...Good... There is no twist (none... NONE..).. And the entire movie we just see an agent going from scene to scene of the old Jigsaw crimes.. and somehow imagining how they all happened... by just standing there (and self narrating the past events..). There is a sub plot involving a bunch of 5 other subjects.. but if you don't pick how that ends after jigsaws ""i wanna play a game rant"" Then you've obviously never watched a saw movie. (**major spoiler** -also the 5 people in that subplot game didn't seem to mind killing each other at any given chance as well.. Not to mention it was random as.. the literally just turn on each other without giving reason.. then at the end instead of killing each other they decide to work together... it didn't really fit with the characters that we had been shown through the movie... Im surprised that the guy didn't shove the girls arm into the trap after finding out she was the one who set him up for the murder of the 8 people.. He just goes ""Its your fault I'm here... But hey.. lets work together... Umm... OK...).OK.. So lets ignore the terrible story that doesn't go anywhere (not to mention the B grade acting..) So we come to the traps... Saw 3 + 4 mainly rode on the fact that the traps got more and more gore filled then the original first movies.. And that helped carry them a bit since the story was semi lacking... So I'm confused why every trap in this movie... Is... Well lame.. We see a guy get sliced in half lamely.. A girl lose her head.. Some dude blown away without seeing anything.. Girl stabbed in the neck.. and a couple of people bleed a little out of their arms (probably the most violent scene in the movie..) Maybe the other titles have desensitized me to gore and violence.. But it was all quite tame in comparison.Plus the lame attempt to fill half the movie with Flashbacks just to have jigsaw in the movie (while its nice to see Mr Tobin again..) just seemed like a massive time filler... Which sums this movie up nicely. Its just a filler. No questions are answered in this one... Apparently there is some huge underlining plot that we still aren't privvy to because the producers want to milk it for all its worth for at least another sequel. And you know what.. I'll see the damn sequel just cos i want to see how the series ends.. Which we all know is going to end with Hoffman getting killed by Gordan who will be the final new Jigsaw. We all know thats where its heading.... ;)"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,anaconda-40658,,animation,2015,NA,"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie (2008): Dir: Mike Nawrocki / Voices: Phil Vischer, Mike Nawrocki, Cam Clarke, Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Gerow: Surprisingly creative Christian theme animation that regards the hero that we can all be regardless of size or status. All the animated characters are here save for Bob the Tomato, who is revealed only in the conclusion as the film's director. One big issue is that these characters do not appear to have limbs, yet they seem to carry or pick up objects as if they had. We have Pa Grape, who fears that his children do not respect him as much as the hero in the play they're watching. Larry the Cucumber seems to fear everything, and Mr. Lunt works with him at the venue where the play takes place. Central plot regards an adventure they're swept up in involving a princess who desperately desires to rescue her brother, the prince from the evil Robert the Terrible. Along the way they encounter giant yet docile rock creatures as well as snack food that turns the tables and attempts to make snacks out of our heroes. The animation is colourful and the screenplay is surprisingly detail without being too complicated for children. Another plus is that it avoids being preachy where many Christian films fail. While the heroes rise above expectations, the screenwriters were obviously avoiding being labelled as not doing anything. Score: 9 / "
Gomorrah             ,latinese,,crime,2008,9,"After too many years I have finally seen an Italian film that doesn't make me feel regret for the old glories of our cinema (Fellini, Rossellini, etc.). Gomorra (obviously a pun on the name of the Neapolitan mafia, ""camorra"") is a terrible masterpiece--Yeats talked of a terrible beauty and here you are, this is it. Great direction, great stories (it's a multiple plot film), great acting. But--above all--here you have the sense of the landscape which has always been the hallmark of great Italian films (especially the attention to urban landscape that you have in Rossellini, Pasolini, De Sica). And Garrone managed to mix an almost neo-realistic approach with one of the most genuinely American film genres, the gangster movie.The only problem is that Neaples and its hinterland (especially Caserta) are like that, and that is the country we live in, after all.Another interesting feature of the film is the language. All characters speak in unadulterated Neapolitan and Casertan dialect, and that forced the director to put subtitles in the *Italian* edition of the film. It adds a lot to the estrangement you may feel, and to the sheer power of the film.However, let me repeat it: this is on the same level of our classics of the 1940s and 1950s. And, after his stunning debut with L'imbalsamatore, Matteo Garrone has persuaded me he's the Next Big Thing in Italian cinema. (He was also helped by Saviano's book, though.)"

The Merry Gentleman             ,Siamois,,crime,2010,4,"This very simple tale aims for a feel similar to a Coen brothers noir-ish film but the actual craftsmanship and writing is not up to the task. The premise is that of two loners who have nothing in common but nonetheless bound together. One character is a hit-man, played by director Michael Keaton. The other is Kate, a woman fleeing a past of abuse, played by Kelly MacDonald.Unfortunately, there's nothing here to rejuvenate the classic elements such as the nice-guy- hit-man who is poorly socialized. The quirky relationships falls a little flat compared to other movies of the genre. Everybody will root for poor Kate to get her life on track after a bad relationship, I couldn't help but feel it all tied up a little nicely for her.There's just nothing terribly interesting about this plot or the characters to make me ca"

This documentary style crime mosaic is essential viewing, plain and simple. If you want to get a true sense of what modern organized crime is about, how it operates, how it permeates a particular place and how it effects individuals, look no further. Gomorrah is unflinching, uncompromising, devoid of glamour or conceit, it puts you right into its unforgiving and hopeless milieu.

The Dark Knight             ,LennyRenquist,0,action,2008,10,"I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet. But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film. To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'. While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest. And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too. But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast. Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate. Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...? It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame. If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment. Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks. As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea. Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz. Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK. Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz. Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister! The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action. I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary. 892"

The Yellow Handkerchief             ,jdesando,0,adventure,2010,NA,"Road trips in American film have often been flamboyant metaphorsEasy Rider and Thelma and Louise come quickly to mind. The Yellow Handkerchief will not be remembered so readily given its low-key, Southern slow delivery. Yet it has a subtle power to inform the Louisiana bayou landscape with meaning as three strangers embark by auto for destinations barely known.Brett Hanson (William Hurt) has just been released from 6 years in prison for manslaughter. Ignorant of this fact is Martine (Kristen Stewart), a fifteen year-old runaway, who invites Brett to ride with her and Gordy (Eddie Redmayne), who is a stranger and a strange young man having the advantage of a convertible and enough cash for a trip that might end up in New Orleans.Like a European film, Handkerchief takes it time to reveal character, meet a conflict and climax, and settle down to its title, which is unsubtly tied to the handkerchief and a pop tune about an ex-convict ""comin' home."" Hurt, one of America's finest actors, brings gravity and melancholy to a role that requires sorrow and redemption to ride along with hope. I hope he receives a well-deserved Oscar nod and the grand prizethink of Jeff Bridges' win for Crazy Heart, a more histrionic part than Hurt's understated torture.While I'm still trying to warm up to Kristen Stewart as anything but a vampire lover of little acting range beyond a hesitating delivery, Maria Bello as May, Brett's love interest, is plain persuasive as the one who tries to understand and work with the eccentricities of Brett.Of course, Katrina as family wrecker is quietly in the background, and because this is a story of the search for family, or ""belonging to something,"" the hurricane informs every grasp for lost love as the vanished twin towers might do. If you want slow exposition that offers character development of the first order, then ride along with these three misfits to find a bit of yourself in the journey."
Deception             ,drylungvocalmartyr,0,crime,2008,4,"The thriller is one of the genres I enjoy most so I give it a chance every time a promising one appears on the horizon. And Deception had promise: Ewan McGregor, Hugh Jackman, and Michelle Williams, actors I think highly of; Dante Spinotti, brilliant cinematographer of Heat and LA Confidential; and a story of anonymous sex, a secret list and white-collar crime.Unfortunately, Deception turned out to be a film of unfulfilled promises. The script lacks the least bit of originality, if you've seen a thriller or two, you'll figure out the ""twists"" in no time. Even the film's title reeks of zero imagination, it simply gives away the one thing that should be kept hidden until the second half of the movie. Not to mention the various hints that enable even the less imaginative moviegoers to see the turns of the story from miles away. This is not how you make a thriller that should keep you guessing what will happen next<U+0085> It's quite frustrating to watch a scene (the money transfer to Spain) and think ""oh, this is when I'm supposed to be holding my breath for Ewan to succeed! But hey, something's wrong, I don't give a damn!"" It is clearly a sign that the movie does not work.The only saving grace of the film is the cinematography and there are a couple of good scenes between McGregor and Williams but they only make Deception barely watchable and cannot save it from its fate: complete oblivion"
Righteous Kill             ,isabelle1955,0,crime,2008,NA,"This movie is a very contrived vehicle for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino with almost nothing to recommend it that I could discern. It contains every cop movie cliché in the book, lots of 'manly' dialogue and ends with our two cop buddies spouting deathbed philosophy. On a broad scale, movies come in three sorts; 1. Stories that just have to written, because they need to be told. Often these are based on real events. Then someone thinks about how to put it on screen and who might be good actors to cast in the various roles.2. The truly vivid, memorable imaginings of someone really creative who wants to construct an entertaining fantasy. Then, as in number 1, someone thinks about who might be good actors to cast in the various roles.3. Highly contrived (and often unlikely) vehicles for Big Names, who want to make another movie, and may have convinced a studio exec that they can fill a few seats in movie houses. And get paid a lot.In other words, in 1 and 2 the story comes first and in 3, the actor comes first. I'm a big fan of the first two, and very dubious about the third. And I'm afraid Righteous Kill comes squarely in category 3. I didn't actually hate it, but it overwhelmed me with indifference. And I used to love these guys!De Niro (Turk) and Pacino (Rooster) <U+0096> and even the names put me off <U+0096> are two veteran (very veteran, but more of that later) New York cops. They are working a case which appears to involve a serial killer who has set himself up as judge and jury to take out the nasty people the courts let off. They may or may not have put the wrong person away for a murder some years before. The sticky, serial killer, finger of guilt is pointing inexorably to it being one of their own, a cop. It's really just a case of staying awake long enough to establish which one of our tough guy, anti-heroes it is. Now it seemed so blindingly obvious to me within the first half an hour who the guilty party was, that I thought it must be a double bluff. You know, it's so obviously X, that it must really be Y, but, hey, that's too simple too so really it's X after all but we're supposed to think it's Y etc. But no. It really was that simple. It was X all the time, and any double bluff was merely my over-active imagination striving to keep me interested. (Although I will say in the movie's defense that my spouse didn't 'get it' until the very end. Unfortunately that may say more about him than it does about the movie! He'd had a tough week at work.)I hate to have to say this, but De Niro and Pacino are just too old to convincingly play tough guys any more. Pacino bears a passing resemblance to Keith Richards these days, and although De Niro may have weathered slightly better, I kept thinking as I watched this, that no studio would ever cast two grizzled women in their sixties as street wise cops, so why am I ( a grizzled woman in my 50s) supposed to find these two guys convincing? The female characters are the usual run of plain but virtuous, weeping rape victims and semi-clothed quasi hookers, beloved of tough guy cop movies, except for the token CSI copette Karen Corelli (Carla Gugino) who is, of course, a stunner. (She appears both clothed and semi clothed.)We see very little of her professional aptitude, but our Karen loves nothing more than a bit of rough sex with Turk and as there are only some 28 years between Gugino and De Niro, I should probably be grateful she wasn't bonking Rooster. In one particularly gratuitous scene Karen gets sexually aroused by Turks' vivid description of the violence inflicted on a suspect, which is doubtless intended to get that vital 18-30 male demographic giggling, but should really have the whole NYC female police corps out on strike in protest. At the vital moment she loses her bottle and can't shoot the bad guy. Sigh<U+0085><U+0085><U+0085><U+0085><U+0085> I just find such sexist tripe so tedious these days. I can't imagine where my sense of humour went? I mean it was funny the first two or three hundred times I saw it. In movie after movie. But now? No thanks. Definitely 2 thumbs down for this clichéd, hackneyed, tedious B flick. De Niro and Pacino, do you really need the money THAT much?"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,alfredsetian402,0,adventure,2013,10,"The character Brett Hanson has a history that unfolds at first in a series of flashbacks then orally to his two companions, Martine and Gordy. Martine, the daughter of an inter-state truck driver, is a lonely 15 year old girl looking for love and acceptance.Gordy is a lonely white young geeky computer repairman that believes himself to be Native American.Gordy owns a gas guzzling beast of car from the 1970's that transports the three of them towards the unknown in post Katrina, Louisiana.How the color yellow pops up from time to time was a nice addition to the original story. Gordy buys a yellow throwaway camera that is ""preferably past its expiration date."" Then, at the riverside, slams the camera against the wet rocks before he takes photos of Martine doing a few ballet positions. The resultant photos look bleached, abstract and surreal. Perhaps a commentary on how people can interpret reality differently. During a heavy downpour, Brett borrows Gordy's yellow tent to sit under instead staying in the car with his companions. A yellow fire hydrant causes a lot of grief for Brett and his wife, May. May's hair is dyed yellow.Brett has become the quintessential glass-is-half-empty sort of man that expects to be let down every day. So when he hands his wife, May, a yellow manila envelope I was able to guess its contents.And finally, a yellow handkerchief near the end.Life handed these four people lemons and they in turn made lemonade.

The Incredible Hulk             ,A_Different_Drummer,0,action,2016,10,"About 1100 reviews on the old IMDb and I am going to do something I have never done before -- review on a bell curve.Seriously, before you start listing all the things you DIDN'T like, ask yourself how many live action Hulk movies have there been outside of the Avenger ensemble acts? Answer: Two. Only two. Just two.And the entry from Ang Lee was so wretched, so horrific, that this one gets a push up the curve.It is actually a solid film. Roth makes a great villain. Tyler was a great love interest. (The scene where Hulk becomes a giant fire extinguisher is one for the record books and memorable). And Norton is arguably the highest-level A-lister to ever play the role.(Or, also arguably, to ever play it again -- notice he was gone from the Avenger movies. Also notice that the two solo-Hulk movies did so poorly at the box office that this one actually ends with a promo for the coming Avengers, suggesting that the suits at Marvel are no longer interested in gambling on Hulk in a film by himself and all your future Hulk movies may be of the animated variety).All done, this is a much better film than the reviews would suggest."
Saw V             ,robertallenandersonjr,0,crime,2008,8,Saw V was just as good as all the others ones. It does have the same amount of gore. It does start right away with a bang just like all the others. The story was very good in this one as well. It didn't have the best acting but was okay. It wasn't that jumpy or to scary but did have a few scares and jumps. It is a great movie to go see during Haloween. It did have a few boring moments but for the most part keeps you entertained. The movie does go very deep into the story with this one. Some of the games were fun and some were bad. This saw was more like the second one. The ending was led up very well for a great finale. The whole movie was fun though and intense for the most part. Overall would recommend seeing this saw if you have seen all the others.
Frost/Nixon             ,filmquestint,0,misc,2008,8,"A remarkable performance by Frank Langella as Richard Nixon transforms this unexpected Ron Howard film into a gripping and unforgettable experience. The behind the scenes of the famous David Frost, Richard Nixon interviews pale in comparison to the compelling sight of Nixon/Langella thinking. It was difficult to forget that Michael Sheen was not Tony Blair but David Frost. Sheen's Frost is an entertaining foil to Langella's somber,sad, desolate portrait of the former president. Ron Howard finds a winning pace giving the true tale a fictional slant. Unfortunately I never saw the stage production and the film never betrays its theatrical origins. In a bizarre sort of way this is Ron Howard's most cinematic film. I highly recommend it. 1"
Hancock             ,yellocar,0,action,2008,8,"The latest Will Smith effort is much different from the average big budget flashy superhero movies that have dominated the box office the last few years. Don't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman, Fantastic 4, Ironman or Hulk. The superhero angle is treated much differently here. I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months. Those trailers represent a small part a movie that is so much more to than a drunken superhero throwing a whale at a boat, swearing at a kid or wrecking the city. Sure, there are laughs in this movie, but it's Will Smith! He's FUNNY! Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ironman and The Hulk. But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic. It is a film with a story that happens to be about a guy with super powers. Besides, it's got Will Smith and Charlize Theron in it! How can you go wrong? 1"
La siciliana ribelle             ,arzewski,1,crime,2012,NA,"Someone tells you one word: ""Sicily"". Quick, quick, what do you think? you think of Godfather scenes, of rolling rural landscapes, societies scarred by vendettas and inter-family violence, closeups of old rugged facial lineaments, scenes of emigration on rural lifestyle.Now, the true Sicily is much different, with modern office buildings, people holding cell phones and having business meetings, and a much more urban society.For a motion picture financed and produced just a few years ago, and supposedly on a modern story, this production was a disappointment. Totally stereotypical. I mean, Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" from forty years earlier looks much more modern.Obviously, the producers wanted to create a cash cow and sell it to the American audience, still nostalgic of the GF series. Smart movie-goers can easily see through the facade, and not like this production. The producers think that the audience is stupid enough to see their stereotypical work.If you want to see a motion picture that portrays modern Italy with its crime-ridden background, see Gomorrah"
Milk             ,pyotr-3,0,misc,2008,10,"""Milk"" is the best film of 2008, hands down. Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Harvey Milk and his murder needs to know it. Those of us who have already read a ton of books and articles about Harvey Milk, and seen the award-winning documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" will find a side of Harvey we had not seen before in this movie so the film really is a must-see whoever you are.The performances by the entire cast are perfection... a notch better than even the best of films. I believe this is due to the story of Harvey Milk, who inspired so many of us and changed the lives of millions of us for the better. Harvey himself surely inspired these great performances. Once you have seen Harvey's smile, and heard Harvey's words, and seen Harvey in action (as we all can do by watching ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" documentary) you can never see the world the same way again.Sean Penn's performance as Harvey could not be bettered by any actor living today, so we owe him a great debt for making this movie, and giving his heart and soul to the role. I believe it is Penn's most mature yet also most lovable role ever. I wanted the movie to go on and on, because I felt like I was actually there in San Francisco in 1978-79. Gus Van Sant recreated that world perfectly, and Sean Penn showed us the potential of this very real man with this unique ability to inspire and transform us. Gus and Sean have each earned a very special chamber in Heaven for giving us this beautiful tribute. "
The Escapist             ,Jasna-Balorda,,crime,2016,1,"This is potentially one of the most overestimated films in the last decade. It is visually attractive, modern and stylish with interesting choice of colors but everything else seems to be a result of poor choices and even worse logic. This film is not a thriller and most certainly not an action film, as some of the reviewers have noted. It is a misery inducing exercise in bad drama that will leave you feeling just short of suicidal. To begin with, there is the ""jumping back and forth in time"" element. This is usually used in films sparingly, so that the time sequence either starts in the past and then finishes in the now or the opposite. This film jumps back and forth so many times and so often that you end up having no clue whatsoever what part you are actually watching. Not only is this irritating, but it also makes it impossible for you to actually follow the attempted escape as, just as soon as they start running, a couple of minutes later you find yourself back in prison. Secondly - character development. There is none. Full-stop. Films about escape are all about characters, that's what provides the element of suspense. The film becomes important when you start sympathizing with the lead character. None of that whatsoever. Also, the film advertises itself as a story about a band of misfits. Being a misfit to me means a person of a certain character - puzzling or interesting in some way, but certainly non conventional. In this film, however, you learn nothing about the characters apart from their names. Thirdly, the plan is developed in like 3 seconds. The main part of the film, the part that actually makes you invested as it tickles your intelligence and sense of imagination is just missing. No character development, no plot development in a film that has a difficulty deciding whether to be a drama or a thriller, but ends up being misery porn. See this movie if you want to irrevocably cast away an hour and a half of perfectly good time that can be used for a host of other, more interesting thing"
Surveillance             ,chicken-licken,1,crime,2009,5,"This film was ruined, as far as I can see, by the twist at the end, and by the directing in most parts. Until the twist was revealed, I'd assumed that Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond were simply giving the worst performances of their careers. As it happens, they were doing a reasonable job, but to no avail. The dialogue was utterly abysmal. I think Lynch is trying to create an atmosphere of complete discomfort for the audience by employing this 'trick', but instead it only serves to hamper any character development. Rather than create a creepy-but-socially-adaptable character in Sam Hallaway, Pullman and Lynch have turned him into someone who appears to be suffering from the after-effects of a lobotomy. He also spends the entire film looking like he has a cricked neck, which looked utterly stupid. Essentially it's a good premise for a film, and it was occasionally tense and gripping. However, there's something missing, and I felt that whatever it was turned what could have been a great thriller into something slightly farcical."
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,FilmRap,0,adventure,2010,8,"83 year old Arthur Cohn who is a five time Oscar winner with films dating back to 1961 was the producer of this film and guest at our screening. He noted that for many of his great movies, including The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, it was often difficult to get a distributor and the films did not achieve box office success until they won the Oscar. In the case of this current film he told us that be thought that the reason he had trouble getting a distribution (finally picked up by Samuel Goldwyn Films) was because this movie does not have sex or any significant violence which many people believe are necessary for a movie to achieve box office success. This film is a road movie which follows Brett, played William Hurt, as he is released from prison after serving 6 years and hitches a ride with a 15 year old girl played by Kristen Stewart (of Vampire movie fame) and slightly older teenage guy played by Eddie Redmayne. Both young people have their own histories of feeling unloved and would like to get away from their unhappy lives. Brett's history unfolds through a series of short flashbacks as they travel in the south towards New Orleans. He had a troubled youth and hadn't made much of his life. He thought perhaps things were changing around when he met May played by Maria Bello, but his view of himself as a flawed person along with some particular circumstances caused him to destroy this relationship and end up in jail. As the three travelers who were seemingly going nowhere in their lives get to understand each other and grow, there is a sense of redemption. You see these three misfits and unlikely companions travel in a battered old convertible through Louisiana on their way to New Orleans which is beautifully photographed by award winning Director of Photography Chris Menges. The energy and eternal hope that producer Cohn put into this project (which comes to the to the screen three years after it was filmed) makes us want to root for the this movie to be successful just as we find ourselves also rooting for the characters to make it in their lives. You are left with the dream of the possibility of second chances, which is no small fe"
WALL·E             ,verkoren,0,animation,2008,10,"I just saw the screener in the theater and was amazed. I am the kind of person that has never liked science fiction movies. I have tried all the famous movies in this genre, like Star Wars, The Matrix and A Space Odyssey and hated all of them. Next to me in the theater were a couple of Sci-fi-lovers and they loved Wall-E beyond belief. I did too, however. Wall-E is: A) A great story B) Packed with fun and humor C) Built up with memorable characters D) Fun for all ages E) Revolutionary in animation techniques The world Pixar creates is so credible, you forget it is animation. Thumbs up for Wall-E as well, he is such a cute and adorable character, you will fall in love with him immediately. I loved EVE as well. 3"
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,sunraider,1,adventure,2008,7,"I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would. I saw it in a local theater that was unusually crowded, mostly with families with young children. Everybody seemed to enjoy themselves; the kids liked the animals and the parents chuckled at the romantic lines uttered by the love-struck Papi to his ""mi corazon."" This film is not about silly Beveryly Hills dogs-- it mostly takes place in Mexico as the dog-napped Chloe encounters various colorful Mexican characters and tries to make her way across the border. The non-human characters are voiced by Latino actors familiar to most American audiences, including George Lopez and Cheech Marin as a rat. Even the venerable Placido Domingo is on hand lending his beautiful voice to the character of Monte, king of a wild tribe of Chihuahuas who come to Chloe's aid.The actors lending their voice perfectly fit the role, the Mexican locations are a nice touch, and George Lopez gets off some cute one liners like ""We're MexiCANs, not Mexican'Ts!"" People had a good time watching this film. This movie is cute, and a plus is the fact that there was no potty humor, which always seems to be present in films geared towards young children. A fun film all around."
Untraceable             ,jedijosh-1,1,crime,2008,1,"I wanted to start off this review by pointing out to the many people who claim that this was an ""original thriller."" Have they not watched the movie ""Virtuosity"" where a killer kills people based on the ratings of a television station? What about the television show ""Millennium: Episode THE MIKADO"" where the plot is basically the same? The movie reeks with propaganda. First is the not so subtle anti-piracy theme that repeats a few times throughout the movie. But what makes it worse is that they paint a picture of movie pirates as being iniquitous enough to also steal people's credit card numbers, and they are gay weirdos as well. Secondly (and maybe not so many people picked up on this) was the movie's implications that Net neutrality will lead to these type of sites being created. Third was the line from the FBI agents at the beginning when they found their internet thief based on the fact that he had *Gasp* registered guns. Apparently cyber freedom is bad, registering guns are bad, but ""On Star"" is good and that is this movie in a nutshell."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,sancorana,0,misc,2008,4,"Okay, I really wanted to like this movie. I loved Step Up, and I was hoping that this movie would at least come close to the same level. But...it really didn't. Chemistry between the leads was missing...in fact, chemistry between any of the characters was lacking. I am still not sure why they cared about each other at all. Also, I felt like there was no point to the movie except to string a bunch of dance scenes together. There was no real growth on the part of Andi, or the other characters. Maybe originally this movie was intended to show how someone from the streets could fit in...but I never saw Andi struggle. The dialogue was cliché and boring, and the minor characters, while perhaps intended to add humor and depth, did nothing for me.And then...the dancing.A lot of people have been raving about the dancing in this movie, and saying that it is the only good thing about it. However...it was ALL THE SAME. There was hardly any variation when it came to style, except for maybe five seconds of a mediocre ballet student. I felt like I was looking at the same dance over and over and over again, with the moves slightly reshuffled. The one exception was the final dance, which I did enjoy watching. At least the original Step Up combined different types of dancing to some extent; that was completely lacking here.In short...stay at home and save your 12 bucks, and if you're looking for a dance movie, go back and watch the original movie again. This isn't worth it."
The Square             ,RJBurke1942,0,crime,2010,8,"In a tradition that began with the French back in 1938, Nash and Joel Edgerton have written, produced, directed and edited a truly gritty film noir  replete with the requisite femme fatale  within a typical Australian setting, in around the outer suburbs of Sydney. While the story is fiction, there is nothing fake about the mise-en-scene, the culture of the Australian male, the everyday corruption in personal and business life and so on...Because it's all so ordinary. That's what makes it so interesting, evoking a comparison with the more famous Cohen brothers who have delighted us with Blood Simple (1984), Fargo (1996), No Country for Old Men (2007) and others  all of which showed us how ordinary, decent, criminal people get involved in nefarious activities which, ultimately, resulted in mayhem, chaos and death, for some.So, in a typical suburban setting, a couple (both married) are having a torrid affair, with the woman urging her lover to run away with her. When she finds a bag of money in the upper crawl space of her house, hidden by her husband, she steals it and convinces her lover to burn the house down, thus covering the loss of the money. Or, so they think...As always, though, the unexpected arrives: when the house burns, so also an old woman who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. And, from there on, the lives of those involved in the dirty business spiral completely out of control as, inevitably, one thing leads to another and the bodies begin to pile up. But, that's not all.Meshing with the lover's attempts to scarper with the money is a twisted sub-plot and mystery that totally muddy the main story and will leave most  maybe all  viewers uncertain about the expected outcome to the whole story. Oh, you intuitively know that, in film noir, there'll be dramatic irony; in this one, however, everybody does get what they deserve, but for the wrong reasons. Maybe that's what happens in real life, more often than not? As the lovers, David Roberts (as Raymond) and Claire van der Bloom (as Carla) are near perfect: he as the reluctant, uncertain cuckold, she as the relentless pragmatist doing whatever it takes. Against them, there is Anthony Hayes (as Greg) and Joel Edgerton (as Billy) but these two men know nothing of the other until the final shootout  a meeting to be savored for its terrific pacing, editing and irony. In the background, murkily adding to the mix, there is the always-riveting Bill Hunter (as the construction boss, Gil), Paul Caesar (as the very surprising Sgt. Miles), Kieran Darcy-Smith (as Barney) and Brendan Donoghue (as Leonard).This is a mature and superbly produced film by two brothers who, in my opinion, will just get better and better. Foreign viewers might have some difficulty with strong Aussie accents from some characters  but no worse than some accents from some other countries. Do persevere with The Square, however: you won't be disappointed.My only real quibble is that a quote in the advertising material compares this one to Body Heat (1981). That's a stretch, I think: the two stories are quite different in substance, style and outcome. So, if you've seen that great film noir from Lawrence Kasdan, don't be mislead going in to see The Square.As to the actual square, well, there's no doubt that Raymond is a pretty dull sort of bloke who fumbles and bumbles his way into trouble fairly easily. But, he's also in construction and he's trying to get a large square of concrete poured to hide one of his biggest mistakes - buried there - before somebody finds out (I'm reminded of William H. Macy's bumbling Jerry in Fargo). Unhappily for Raymond, somebody does find out...Highly recommende"
Julia             ,dusan-22,1,crime,2010,6,"Solid movie. First of all, excellent acting of the female lead. I was impressed when read that the actress has never drunk a glass of liquor and we got to say that she was so convincing as alcoholic. Then, the movie itself deserves attention, it has solid dynamic plot and good story. What I don't like about this movie is passive camera that is following the heroine behind every corner through long shots as well as limited interaction with other characters. Also, I believe that ending supposed to be a little bit more sophisticated, refined in a film way. However, I do not agree that is unclear since we know all the time what is Julia's reason for kidnapping: she has no Acapulco or Swiss Bank plans, she does that to change her life. When she figured out that the kidnapped boy have already changed her life pretty much, he becomes more valuable rewar"

Ashton Kutcher is awesome in his role a chocolate hero with innocent personalty. Do not forget the role of Rob Corddry as a lawyer you will see his best performance in it. When talk about the story of the movie, it is very simple and straight about a couple who were married when they are unconscious and then the chemistry between them start.

The Women             ,aanderberg,1,comedy,2008,1,"This movie was confusing more than anything else. I still can't figure out what the message is of this movie and more so, who the target audience is? As this is a remake (which I have not seen) maybe it's so bad because the dialogue is outdated? Or is the target audience 19-year old girls that might grab this excuse of a film at 2 for 1 Sex and the City-night?What happened to Candace Bergen? - As Meg Ryans mother she provided an intelligent balance in rhetorics and dialog but at the end of the movie she has transformed to a babbling, botoxed and victimized housewife. And the Jada Pinkett Smith character as the gay friend who in her womanizer, spread-leg, shot-drinking self is so over the top trying to portray a lesbian that it makes me think that the director never met a gay woman in her life! Why else would she portray this WONDERFUL actress as a foul mouthed macho man? I can't even comment on the Eva Mendez character. Ms Mendez is a fantastic actress who in her prior roles has done nothing but added ""Girl Power"" to the row of the typical Hollywood vamp. She is a sexy, beautiful, strong Latina who in this movie comes off as nothing but a victim. I think the idea was to portray her as the conniving snake who steal other womens husbands - and that's fine. But she comes off as nothing but stupid with the attention span of a tween. If this movie's target audience are adult women, it makes me nothing less than ANGRY. Did the director think that we, the women, are that uninvolved? Incredibly heavy subjects were brought up but all the director did was throw fluff at it. The subject matter of friendship betrayal for example - the entire movie could have been dedicated to it! You have 4 very different women with extreme circumstances. Each one of them could have developed a different solution or cope with the problem and actually have HELPED someone. Do NOT watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time.Please excuse any errors. English is not my first language"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,thorneer,0,drama,2008,7,"""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" would seem to have everything going for it - major stars, an enormous budget, and a conceit that can't be beat. However, in the end it's that very conceit that hamstrings an otherwise wondrous piece of movie-making.Fincher's characters tend to be psychos, paranoiacs, obsessives, some of whom struggle vainly against the darkness in their own souls, but many others who have embraced it. Benjamin Button is none of the above, and that's perhaps his problem. Button, born ""under unusual circumstances"" in 1918 New Orleans, spends his early life literally surrounded by death, raised, as he is, by an orderly in a home for the elderly. As a prematurely old man himself (an effect achieved by fantastic MOCAP work from Pitt), perhaps it's not surprising that as he grows into a body with which he may truly engage the world, he is more content to observe appreciably. Now, this may be true to the spirit of the character, but unfortunately for Fincher and his screenwriter, Eric Roth, it doesn't make for very interesting cinema. At a recent screening, Roth referred to Button's character as the ""anti-Gump"", a classification that seemed both apt and problematic. This film will certainly earn comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' modern classic(also written by Roth), but where that film had a truly fascinating central character, who experienced as many mistakes and tragedies as victories and happiness, Fincher and Roth's protagonist is a cipher. There's a telling sequence around the middle of the film, where Button, by now a merchant seaman holed up in a dingy hotel in Murmansk, strikes up a relationship with a bored wife of a minor British official (Tilda Swinton). Unable to sleep, they meet each night for tea and good conversation (and later, sex). But instead of letting us hear what those conversations are about, he simply creates a montage, set to music, of various meetings fading into one another. By the time Swinton's character departs the film, we know next to nothing new about Benjamin other than that he has trouble sleeping and likes hot tea. The fact is that even Swinton's character, on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes, is more engaging. It's a frustrating glimpse of what might have been, had the filmmakers chosen to put the character before the gimmick, instead of the other way around.Which brings us to Cate Blanchett. As Daisy, whom Benjamin meets as a young girl and who grows into a luminously beautiful and troubled ballet dancer, Blanchett shines as brightly as she ever has on screen. Unlike Benjamin, Daisy is not content to simply accept whatever life throws her way - she has dreams and attempts to act on them, and does her best to lead a normal, interesting life. Benjamin, passive as always, must quietly observe as she grows out of the playmate of his ""youth"" and into a somewhat headstrong woman who nonetheless possessed of enormous potential. His loyalty pays off, though, when circumstances bring them together again at a time when they both happen to be the same age - a fleeting moment, and one they will cherish. But again, the relationship between couple and audience is one-sided, because while we can see why Daisy would wish to return to the rock-steady loyalty of Benjamin, it's unclear what he feels about her other than a regard (she's certainly lovely enough). We are told in rather soggy voice-over narration (spread throughout the film) that Daisy is ""the most beautiful person I'd ever seen"", but that's all we'll get. And so it goes, for nearly three hours. We cut frequently, and irritatingly, back to a modern-day hospital in New Orleans, where a dying Daisy asks her daughter (Julia Ormond) to read to her from Benjamin's diary as Hurricane Katrina pounds on the windows. There's something being said in these scenes about regret and the passage of time, but the appealing Ormond's character is one-note, and Blanchett seems nearly suffocated under pounds of old age makeup. It's from this diary whence springs Benjamin's narration, but, as Mr. Roth pointed out, Gump this ain't. Suffice it to say that the budget is up there on screen as we go on this strange trip through the twentieth century with Brad Pitt as our guide. A possibly unintentional (I doubt it) laugh arises mid-film when Benjamin finally reaches something around Pitt's own age. He strides into a garage in the mid-50's, decked out in leather jacket and shades, and whips a tarp off a motorcycle, on which he speeds out to the harbor to do some bare-chested sailing on a boat he builds himself (the shades remain on his head). It's a knowing wink to the wish-fulfillment of the casting - who wouldn't want their old crotchety husband to get younger and younger until they looked like Brad Pitt? - and a clever way to underscore the underlying tragedy of the situation. Sure, he looks like Brad Pitt in ""Fight Club"", ""Se7en"", ""Thelma & Louise"", but eventually he's going to look like Brad Pitt in ""Cutting Class"", and then Brad Pitt in seventh grade, and finally Brad Pitt as a toddler, and that's not so sexy.Pitt does a fine job. It's a pity that Fincher, who has used him to such great effect twice before, didn't let him cut loose. Instead this is his most low-key performance since Meet Joe Black, in which he played Death, who was really just a nice young man curious about the world. Come to think of it, that's pretty much all that Benjamin Button is, and, if nothing else, he knows more about death than just about anybody around. Too bad that a film that means to affirm life turns out to be rather lifeless. 1"
Wendy and Lucy             ,bkimbrell0,1,drama,2009,9,"WOW, that is easily the most depressing film I saw this year, hands down. Michelle Williams and Lucy the Dog star as Wendy and Lucy, respectively, in this remarkably affecting drama about a poor, independent woman escaping from her undisclosed troubles and making her way to Alaska with her dog. All the two have in life is each other, money is tight, food is hard to come by, and sleeping in the car is the only option for Wendy. A devastating turn of events happens to Wendy, and Lucy subsequently goes missing, leading Wendy on a mission to recover the only companion she has in her life. Along the way, Wendy encounters indifferent individuals whose actions are driven by self-righteous attitudes, but Wendy also finds help in an unlikely place, a compassionate security guard. In many ways, Wendy and Lucy succeeds in areas where Bolt (2008) came up short, but they both approach their themes in very different ways. Wendy and Lucy is absolutely heartbreaking, forcing me to cry out ""NO!"" twice in its duration. The ending was an absolute shocker to me, and actually squeezed a few tears out of my eyes.In this film, Lucy becomes a character in her own right, a brilliantly effective choice. Lucy becomes not just a symbol of everything Wendy loves in this world, but her only hope for survival. It is never specified, but the audience member is allowed to create an entire backstory behind these main characters. I like to believe that Lucy is a childhood pet of Wendy's, who helped Wendy through a difficult childhood, perhaps with abusive parents, in a foster home, whatever you would like to believe. It makes Wendy's situation that much more affecting. If you've ever felt like you have but one object in this world to turn to in times of trouble, and you've felt like escaping from chains that are holding you down, and beginning a new life for yourself someplace new. If you've ever felt so cut off from other individuals in this world, like screaming at the top of your lungs. If you've ever been placed in such a desperate situation, where your livelihood is threatened, and all that you love seems as though it is vanishing before you, you will undoubtedly shed a tear at this incredibly powerful drama about the connections humans make, the friendships we forge, and the sacrifices we must sometimes make.9/10"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,murray_mg,,animation,2008,NA,"....a riff on ""ScarFace""! No kidding, I howled with laughter during the climax, when Larry challenges the bad guy with ""Say hello to my little friend!"" I went to see this new gem from Big Idea with my wife and our five year old son. All of us are die-hard Veggietale fans, and this one does not disappoint. The Pirates start off this time as a hapless trio like the Three Stooges, working in a dinner theater, and get drawn back to the 17th century in a somewhat Narnian way (is that a real word? I don't know). They embark unwittingly on an heroic mission to rescue a young prince and princess from their pirate uncle, kidnapped while their Aslan-like father the king is away. Very well done. And while there is not an OVERT biblical message, the return of the missing King parallels Matthew 28 very nicely, without being pushy about it. There is also a very funny sendup of the B-52's campy dance classic ""Rock Lobster"". Go see this one, it's great!"
Summer Hours             ,mehmet_kurtkaya,1,drama,2009,10,"Up until now, you may have seen films that are told through the eyes of a specific character, a child or even a dog. However this film achieves the impossible, it tells the story of generations through the eyes of the objects! The film opens with a large family gathering in a gorgeous old house located in French countryside. The house lies in the middle of a large garden and hosts beautiful antique furniture the owner, mother of three middle aged children, inherited from her uncle. A year later, she dies and the children have to decide about the fate of the house and the furniture.Anyone who has lost a parent or an elder family member possibly has gone through these difficulties depicted so naturally in the film. However, the movie goes beyond the initial thoughts and feelings. Delicate questions asked by this movie are multifaceted and explore the effects of capitalist globalization on generations.Those objects have memories in them. When they are left to a museum, they seemingly belong to the society as whole but to no one at the same time.The elder brother, professor of economy, who lives in France wants to preserve the house, he wants to stick to his roots, to family memories but his brother and sister want to follow their careers in China and US. Yes, by doing so they live in the moment and yes, they are not confined to France and yes, the whole world is theirs but they are also left with nothing. Like objects displayed in the museum.And this duality lives on until the ironic ending, which can be interpreted as optimistic or pessimistic by viewers even tough pessimistic tone is definitely more prevalent.Beautiful acting by Binoche, Charles Berling, Edith Scob and wonderful directing and writing by Assayas. This movie is just lifelike, simple but complex!"
Prom Night             ,stpatrickqin,1,horror,2008,1,"Wow, what an awful movie. Bad writing, bad acting, bad clichés; I really wish I could have the 1 1/2 hours of my life back. This definitely wins the award for the worst movie of 2008 so far. What were they thinking when they made this movie? It's like they put nothing special into it; nothing we've never seen before. Did they really think this was going to work? I knew, going into it, that it would be a bad movie, but I didn't think it'd be the WORST. The only way I'd see this movie again is if I was strapped to my seat, duct tape around my mouth, and my eyes taped open. Even then, I think the sight of seeing me like this would be more exciting than the movie.Save your money!"
The House Bunny             ,inkblot11,1,comedy,2008,7,"Shelley (Anna Faris) was abandoned as a baby on someone's doorstep long ago. As she relates, no one was interested in getting her back although they did request that the basket be returned! Shuttled from one orphanage to another, Shelley eventually found a ""family"" when her womanish figure came into fruition. That's right, Shelley resided in the Playboy mansion and found happiness with Hef and the other gal pal housemates. However, one day Shelley receives word that Hef has given her two hours to move out of the mansion. A fellow worker at the residence suggests that, perhaps, she is getting too old to be a bunny. After all, didn't she just turn 27? And, isn't that like 59 in ""bunny years""? So, off Shelley goes, hurt and scared. After a day on her own, she stumbles onto a nearby college campus and learns that she could possibly find a job, a home, and a salary by becoming a sorority ""mother"" to a group of misfit sisters. These gals, the Zetas, have seen their numbers shrink, mostly because they are all shy and a bit unconventional (among them, Katharine McPhee and Rumer Willis). The college has already told them that if they don't find new members, the Zeta house will be shut down. It is going to be Shelley's biggest challenge to turn the sorority into an attractive place for the new students. Can she do it? Perhaps, Shelly could ask for the help and advice of a nursing home director, Oliver (Colin Hanks), a nice man she met in a park? After a brief, blase beginning, this film packs a good punch of light comedy and romance. Part of the credit should go to the very nice cast. Faris is wonderful in her role as the dimwitted bunny who has more than enough smarts to learn a few new tricks and Hanks, in a smaller role, is quite nice as the love interest. The Zeta girls themselves, especially Rumer Willis and Emma Stone, are a delightful bunch of offbeat creatures that learn some lessons themselves. The rest of the cast, including Christopher McDonald and Beverly D'Angelo, is good, also. The costumes, naturally, are very fine, as this is a gal-dominated movie and clothes are especially important. But, the sunny sets, cinematography, screenplay, and direction are up to snuff as well. No, it's not Willie Shakespeare but the flick is definitely a good diversion from the everyday blues. It's a likely bet that you will find this ""Bunny"" to be quite funny indeed. "
The Secret Life of Bees             ,george.schmidt,1,drama,2008,9,"THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES (2008) *** Dakota Fanning, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, Sophie Okonedo, Paul Bettany, Hilarie Burton, Tristan Wilds, Nate Parker. Well acted adaptation of the best seller by Sue Monk Kidd about a young girl (Fanning) living in the Deep South during the Civil Right Era 1960s, who runs away from her belligerent father (Bettany) to discover who her mother really was, and is welcome into the unlikely arms of a trio of entrepreneurial sisters (Latifah, Keys and Okonedo) who produce honey from their bee farm. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood <U+0096> who also wrote the screenplay - shrewdly avoids any syrupy emotional trickery and instead allows each character's voice to ring true to a fault, with each actress shining in her own right.

Twilight             ,scarletonfire,1,misc,2008,1,"Catherine Hardwicke, please put the camera down. You have absolutely no talent and yes, it does bother me that your daughter does get into every movie you direct. This could've been the greatest film of 2008 but your filthy little hands seem to have gotten on my favorite author. First of all, why in the world is Bella as pale as the vampires? I get that she doesn't tan, but she does still have a pulse according to the book. (Maybe you should read it. I mean, it is just based on the written version of Twilight.) I felt as if I had not read the book, I would have no idea what was going on in the movie, which in my opinion, isn't how a movie should present itself. UGH! GET ME A NEW DIRECTOR!!! 1"
The Lucky Ones             ,jim-355,,adventure,2008,5,"Actually, two parts from the trailer were missing from the movie. Ebert alluded that this movie could have a semblance of ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Don't believe it! Rachel McAdams appeared to be a female Forrest Gump and Tim Robbins was trying to replay Andy DuFresne. The twister scene was the low point. See better twisters in the Wizard of Oz. Time passed slowly in the movie theatre of 3 people.Sorry, I hoped for better because it would have been nice to see the Best Years updated. Fredric March, Harold Russell and Dana Andrews, your performances still rule!"
Bolt             ,rama-28,0,animation,2008,9,"BOLT may not be in the same class as WALL-E but it's still just as entertaining, touching and genuine as any other great animated films that have more than meets the eye. I like watching movies like BOLT because you're bound to not only... have a good time but you'll also get that mushy feeling from its heartfelt story. No matter how tough you think you are, the themes of friendship, family, loyalty will always get you every single time. Definitely a must-see! Especially if you have pets If I were to say anything against BOLT's graphics and animation, it would be like having watched the movie with my eyes closed because the fact remains, the amusing 3D visual effects that this movie treats you with will guarantee the most absolute thrilling, adventurous fun a family can enjoy. They say God is in the details, you'll be hugely impressed at the extent that this movie is willing to go to bring us the most surreal looking dogs or cats or pigeons, just as good, if not better than some of the other CG animated movies I've seen in recent years.Once again, the story will keep you at the edge of your seat. The fast-paced action sequences when BOLT is the show's superhero dog or even when he's not the superhero dog he thought he was. It can often be silly and yet you're glad it is.There's one character, the hamster named Rhino who is just the funniest sidekick since Dori in Finding Nemo. Rhino will get you laughing and laughing and you will beg for more.I gotta give props to John Travolta as the voice of Bolt, Travolta's got the ability to connect with his character and the audience, I'm aware it's just voice work but it's still hard work to make it convincing, he's got the comedic timing and the determination that is BOLT, the dog who is in total denial,.. motivated only by its hope that its person, Penny, will love him back.Watching BOLT is a lot like watching TOY STORY 2, there's that unlikely friendship and teamwork themes to it and at the same time, it's also about how the toy/pets' owners or the humans often would get to a certain point where they'd abandon their toys or their pets resulting in... stray animals walking the streets. The network show that got Bolt famous easily replaces him with another dog, that's how much one can take something for granted. BOLT could be like a spokesperson for animal shelters and adopt-a-pet organizations everywhere. It is truly a movie that's good for everyone of every age."
Wendy and Lucy             ,howard.schumann,1,drama,2008,10,"Hoping to find a job in a fishing cannery in Alaska, Wendy (Michelle Williams), a drifter in her twenties, travels to the Pacific Northwest from her home in Muncie, Indiana with her most endearing companion, a golden Labrador Retriever named Lucy, whom she calls Loo. Looking masculine with a short haircut, a flannel shirt and a sweatshirt with a hood, Wendy seems aimless yet she is believable when expressing a desire for stability to a group of itinerant drifters at a campsite. Co-written by Jonathan Raymond, Kelly Reichardt's deeply affecting Wendy and Lucy, like her 2006 film Old Joy, combines an intimate personal story with a reflection of the malaise felt in the country today, her economic hardship typical of people adrift in a society in which they no longer feel a part.The film is set near the Oregon/Washington border in a small town that, with its roadside strip malls, gas stations, car repair garages, and convenience stores, is reflective of rural American cities and towns that have lost the character that once made them unique. As the film opens, Wendy plays with Lucy in the Oregon woods - the only sounds heard are Wendy humming a melancholy song. While sleeping in her 1988 Honda on Walgreen's property, she is awakened by a security guard (Wally Dalton) who tells her to move on but discovers that her car will not start. On a limited budget, she is shaken when the repair amount confirmed by the town mechanic (Will Patton) is greater than expectations. Trying to save some money, Wendy makes a serious mistake by stealing dog food at a grocery store.Unable to convince a smug teenage clerk to give her a break, Wendy leaves Lucy tied to a post outside the market while she is taken to jail on a shoplifting charge. When released after paying a fine that costs considerably more than the dog food, she discovers that Lucy has disappeared and the film's focus turns to Wendy's frantic and lonely search for her beloved dog. As she pays a visit to the local pound and looks for Loo around the town, a mood of profound emptiness pervades the deserted streets revealing the number of young people that have moved away.Assisted by the Walgreens security guard who lets her use his cell phone to call the pound and leave his number as a call back, Wendy is hopeful after posting signs all over town but the waiting drains her energy and her run-in with a deranged homeless man while sleeping in the woods frightens her to the core. Seeking some solace, she calls her brother in Indiana but meets only indifference, his girlfriend in the background asking what it is that she wants now. Not deterred, Wendy's spirit and determination allows us to recognize that the fight for self worth is not limited by material possessions or the opinion of others. Reminiscent of the Dardenne Brothers' ability to capture the emotional anguish of young people, Wendy and Lucy establishes Reichardt as one of the premier indie filmmakers in the U.S. today."
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,lovelyrhino,1,misc,2008,6,"The girls are back after a brief break during which each is described as being incredibly talented at their respective passions and whisked off to ivy league colleges. After Carmen's helpful voice-over brings us up to date with our favorite Bethesda natives, we begin each's summers - Tibby is working on scripts in summer school, Lena is taking an art class, Bridget is digging for artifacts in Turkey, and Carmen, after realizing to her dismay that none of her friends will be there in the summer, impulsively seizes an opportunity to work back stage at a Shakespearean summer production.I caught the midnight showing of Sisterhood mainly for the estrogen rush, but I won't deny that a certain part of me was eagerly awaiting the return of Carmen, Tibby, Bridget, and Lena. And as a devoted reader of the series, I can certainly say that this movie, comprised of plot elements of books 2,3, and 4 is completely different from their textual counterparts. For example (and without giving too much away, I hope) Bridget's archaeological expedition yields little more than emotional realization - there is no mention of the hunky, married, professor in book 4. Most of the choices only benefited the movie, and overall Sisterhood brimmed with summery, feminine fun. Perhaps my favorite addition was Carmen's plot line - though I admittedly skimmed Carmen's section in the books, I think I would have remembered the theater program story that, in this movie, is just, if not more, interesting then the other girls.So if you liked the first movie, you'll enjoy this one. If you didn't, I'm not making any promises."
Hancock             ,phenomynouss,0,action,2008,3,"...was the reaction I had by the time I finished watching the movie. As much as I have a distaste for using stupid internet acronyms seriously, that's quite literally how I felt.The movie had an interesting premise, in a superhero who is a moody, drinking misanthrope with a particular twitch-spot for being called an asshole.Very early on Hancock's path crosses with That Guy (Jason Bateman's character, the PR guy, whose name is completely forgettable) and they start trying to change him. Maybe 20 minutes into the movie or less, Hancock goes to prison to show people he won't flaunt the law, and to have people clamoring to have him back when crime skyrockets.The majority of the movie's fun happens within the first half, with scenes covered in the trailer (such as tossing a beached whale onto a sailboat) and some new ones not seen in the trailer (Hancock half-naked, his clothes having been burnt off from putting out a fire, cutting in front of kids in front of an ice cream truck and snatching some ice cream for himself), but these are all covered mostly in YouTube spots while That Guy shows Hancock how people don't like him.After he's changed to be more decent, it gets touchy and warm and Hancock is a good guy after all.Then comes the part that had been built up without subtlety... and spoilers follow.It was rather overt that Mary (Charlize Theron) was going to be involved with Hancock, especially when the director goes out of his way to show her face in a closeup whenever he appears near her for several seconds longer than normal. Then comes a post-party scene, in which he basically corners her in a kitchen and tries to kiss her. Then she throws him into the refrigerator and send both crashing out into the street.Oh ya, that's right. She's a superhero thing, too.Then starts the whole ""lolwut?"" moment of the film,, as they try to have her trying to explain to Hancock, her husband, and all of us the whole deal, and fails quite miserably. The story she tells is some mess of them being some sort of godly creatures that were created by GOD (though it is PC never mentioned) in pairs, and that they've lived for like as long as the Bible says earth has existed.. a few thousand years.Quite frankly, that's only my best-guess summarization of the mess of words thrown at us to see what would stick---in the end, it doesn't even matter what they are, as the point they drive home with brutal redundancy is that if the two of them are close by each other, they both lose their powers and become mortal, which is why Hancock lost his memory, because every time they get too close to each other in history, something bad happens and they have to depart, until one time in the late 20s when Hancock got amnesia (and a story of how he tried to sign out from the hospital, not knowing who he was, and a nurse asked him for his ""John Hancock"", as in signature).The story doesn't seem to change, but they repeat it so many times in so many different ways that it throws people off, as they start thinking ""wait, they're destined to be together"", then ""wait, they can't be together or they both become mortal and die"", then ""wait, they were built together by nameless-god"", then ""wait, they weren't meant to be together"", then ""wait, they're bound by fate to always be together"" and so on and so on until you really don't care anymore and you just want someone to die just to change the pace.The entirety of the movie's second-half plot no longer deals with any typical ""good guy vs bad guy"" or ""hero must overcome"" archetype, as a band of baddies escaping from jail try to kill Hancock become so unimportant that even Hancock doesn't spare a second glance at the TV when their breakout is announced on the news.The entire focus is around explaining, then re-explaining, then convoluting the entire concept behind these two ""godly"" beings to a point where their explanations run into gaping plot-holes, the biggest one being: If Hancock's been living in LA long enough to become a household name, and staying in their house around her for several weeks before finding her out, why didn't he or Mary lose any of their powers being in the same city? Considering how she not only tells him to not see her family ever again, but to leave the entire city, and how Hancock starts losing his powers when he is very far away from her, it's completely nonsensical that he only starts to lose his powers AFTER she mentions it.The ending is also nonsensical, as Hancock had earlier in the movie ended up losing his powers when he is shot in a liquor-store hold-up, who knows how far away from Mary's house, and when he and Mary are in the hospital, he starts immediately regaining his powers when he exits the hospital and starts putting a few meters' distance between them.Ultimately, the entire second half of the movie resembled a nonsensical mess of a plot-hole big enough to fit the moon through and a complete lack of actual plot to drive the story other than Hancock's whole ""should I leave the city so I can be a superhero or should I stay for... some reason never explained in the movie"" Because the movie never really does explain why he should/would stay in LA after learning all this... it's not like he fell in love with Mary after his amnesia, and despite all of this revelation, Mary stays married to That Guy and Hancock leaves anyway for their own good. So what the hell?"
Ponyo             ,trpnallday,1,animation,2008,10,"This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also a MAJOR departure from the studio's established style. First of all, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more so than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of animation<U+0085> and yet it is ever so entertaining. Even though there is nothing put in to attract adults, I still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story. The movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings/intentions etc. but that makes them all the more endearing. Special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely amazing despite being way different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie!"
Hancock             ,cattydecatcat,0,action,2010,1,"Last summer a superhero film stormed the box offices both sides of the Atlantic. It was called Hancock, a film about an alcoholic superhero played by Will Smith. A bundle of laughs? NOThe film follows the path of a rude, disgusting, irritating superhero called John Hancock (Will Smith). The public hate him; he causes millions of ""dollars"" worth of damage, is a drunk and makes constantly obscene comments about people. But one day he happens to save the life of a PR Guru (Jason Bateman) and is offered a chance to save his image. This starts of his avid career as a superhero. Until a chance encounter causes the film to dive bomb into the realms of beyond crap.It slots perfectly into the genre of comedy, action, superhero, adventure, romance, sci-fi, fantasy and crime. Though this great mixture of genres usually benefits films, with Hancock it just doesn't work. The film jumps between the various genres so quickly that you never have the actual time to register what's happening and whether the scene is meant to be sarcastic or sentimental. The style changes drastically too; between sad violin music and the latest chart hip-hop; between big set action pieces and amusing family dinners. This attempt at appealing to everybody fails miserably.Personally I would recommend this film to people who have nothing better to do with their time then watch Will Smith throw cars around and make obscenely offensive comments about people. This is not a family film due to the crude remarks, excessive language and unnecessary violence; basically if you showed it to your grandma she would have a heart attack and spend the rest of her life in hospital only able to move the big toe of her left foot.The acting in it is frankly amateur (or should I say appalling). None of the actors seam to like what they are doing- they don't even seam to be trying- they're just acting normally. The producers have obviously tried very hard to get people to hate Will Smith and it works- he is possibly the most unlikeable character in the whole film. British actor Eddie Marsan plays the ""bad guy"" Red, he is acceptable apart the slightly dodgy attempt at an American accent. Not Good. If I was being nice I would say that Will Smith shows quite a good performance as the disgusting superhero, then I look through his previous films and realise that all his characters are basically the same. Only for really die-hard fans.The special effects are disappointing especially when he attempts to land on a pavement in front of some guys house. You feel as if you are watching a 1963 Batman film before they had discovered the wonders of CGI. In fact the CGI is so disappointing it's actually hilarious especially at the end, when you just really want somebody to die, but they just carry on throwing tea urns and hospital beds around while a giant CGI'd thunderstorm rages outside the window- not a good look.In comparison to other films in the genre of Superhero/Comedy it looks terrible. Take Hellboy for instance; the tongue in cheek humour of Guillermo Del Toro combined with the great fantasy creatures in the style of Pans Labyrinth and sarcastic superhero, the film does a really great job. However next to Hellboy the film Hancock just looks more annoyingly, terribly, irritatingly amateur. If you're looking for a decent superhero film with laughs see Hellboy, if you're looking for a dark, chilling superhero film see The Dark Knight and if you're looking for a boring, arrogant, overdone superhero film see Hancock.Overall this film is possibly the worst superhero film of the summer. Only see it if you have to."
"Surfer, Dude             ",nathan-517,0,comedy,2009,10,"This is an awesome surfer movie...blue crush, North Shore, point break, and all the rest are good but this hits the top.This is the story of one surfer trying to live life with the least amount of anything but surfing. His agency wants him to be something else, a living movie advertisement, but he refuses to do so. This story doesn't need any epic plot, no epic love/drama, no fights or controversy. the reason this movie doesn't appeal to most is because they wanted the complicating story line but that's not what this movie is about. It's about surfing and smoking weed and just living life 'j.k. livin' means just keep livin. I recommend this movie to all people that just want to chill for an hour and a half.I love this movie, I wanted to just jump into the movie and exist in it, cause there wasn't any major thing going on it was just life without the complexity."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,sampodog,0,misc,2008,8,"I certainly didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I figured the dancing would be fun. My expectations were exceeded, WAY exceeded. Sure it has a predictable plot and it's nothing more than a right-side-of-the-tracks/wrong-side-of-the-tracks love story (Pretty in Pink, West Side Story, Romeo & Juliet, etc.), but the dancing was really incredible. I'm way older than the target audience and yet I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.If you're looking for groundbreaking plot, acting, or directing, you won't find it here. But the acting/directing was just fine, and the dancing was stellar. If you're concerned with the acting, I guess that would be like going to an action movie and judging it based on the acting rather than the action."
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,hebko,0,animation,2008,8,"I saw this 3-D cgi IMAX film last weekend. It is not the best animated film I've seen lately. The character design wasn't great, the story is too simple and for little kids, the villains are dismissible and the outcome is predictable. It does have some really great looking backgrounds but the animation and the staging is pretty weak. But the effect of 3-D IMAX made the film really fun to watch. Experiencing the original moon landing was exciting again and the theater which was full of kids and adults was totally entranced. I wish they were laughing more or cared more for the characters but it is worth going to an IMAX theater to watch a cgi film that was made for 3-D."
Summer Hours             ,jotix100,1,drama,2009,8,"Helene, the matriarch of a well to do French family, living in a rural setting, is celebrating her 75th birthday. Her three children, Frederic, Jeremie, and Adrienne have come to have lunch with her. The two sons are married, but their sister is not married, although she is seeing someone. Only Frederic still lives in France. Jeremie is an executive now working in China. Adrienne is a designer that has made New York her home. After lunch, Helene summons Frederic to her office to discuss what she wants to do with her possessions once she is dead. She has amassed a large collection of paintings and objet d'art, scattered all over the rambling house. Frederic is disturbed by what he his mother wants him to do, but since he is the only close by, he must be in charge. One thing Helene knows is the value of each piece in her valuable collection. Frederic has wanted to keep the paintings, especially the two Corot landscapes as part of their heritage. Most of the work was collected by an uncle who favored Helene and whose relationship with her is not completely explained, although one suspects there was some kind of incestuous liaison between them. Unfortunately Helene dies a year after we first met her, leaving the siblings in a quandary. Adrienne is the practical one; she knows the tax bite will be enormous and the way about it is to donate the art work to the Musee D'Orsay, interested in most of the furniture and the rest. The older housekeeper Eloise is offered to take something from the house as a souvenir for herself to remember the family and ends up taking a valuable glass sculpture because she always thought it was so ugly that no one would like it.""L'heure d'ete"" is a fine movie written and directed by Oliver Assayas. There is a lot of symbolism in the way the story is presented. One can draw several conclusions about how the estate is being divided since Frederic, one feels, is the only one that shows any appreciation to the significance of letting go of the things he grew admiring and thought they would stay with the family forever, only to see it go to museums in order to avoid inheritance taxes. Mr. Assayas is taking a hard view at the two siblings that have fled the coop and have no interest in keeping what Frederic thought was rightly theirs.This is a French film and the main idea is that in spite of what the three brothers think about the way to solve their problem, they still are civil and talk in a mature tone to one another. We liked Charles Berling as Frederic. He feels a quiet rage at losing control of the inevitable and to the things he loved. The Adrienne of Juliette Binoche is perfect in her take of this woman who has left everything behind to make a new life. Jeremie Renier, who can be seen in the current ""Le silence de Lorna"", and who has worked with the Dardenne brothers, in his native Belgium, was a surprise; he even looks different as the executive living so far away. We also enjoy Edith Scob's quiet intensity as Helene. Behind her serene exterior, there is nothing but a steel resolve to have things done according to her will.Eric Gautier's cinematography does wonders for the enjoyment of the film. This is one of Oliver Assayas' most heartfelt movies. The director knew his characters well and it translates into a film that was a joy to sit through."
Trucker             ,Argemaluco,1,drama,2010,NA,"It is always interesting to see how an independent filmmaker can re-interpret the classic formulas from commercial cinema, discovering unexpected deepness and intense emotions where nothing new seemed to exist.The film Trucker falls into that category, and even though I did not find it to be a great film, it shows enough honesty to make it very interesting, at the same time it is supported by excellent performances.The formula this movie re-interprets is the one of ""irresponsible adult takes care of a kid and both end up learning life lessons"".That cliché usually impulses pathetic comedies such as The Game Plan, Uptown Girls and Raising Helen.Trucker is not a comedy, even though it follows a similar narrative formula; fortunately, its detailed characters, raw intensity and honest intentions bring to it the realism those comedies lack of, as well as a strong narrative basis in order to tell a classic story in a fresh way.Director and screenwriter James Mottern created an interesting main character with a credible narrative ark; however, he should have polished some details from her a bit more.Besides, this film has a few moments which feel a bit tiring.Nevertheless, the brilliant performances are the main thing which compensate that fails to some point.Many people could think that Michelle Monaghan took the leading role in this movie in order to bring one of those ""ugly"" and glamour-free dramatic performances which worked for Charlize Theron in Monster so well.However, I would not think like that, because Monaghan had already shown her histrionic talent in the excellent Gone Baby Gone, and in Trucker, she confirms that she is a magnificent actress, at the same time she explores levels of deepness that she did not have the opportunity to show in the action films (Eagle Eye, Mission: Impossible III) and comedies (Made of Honor, The Heartbreak Kid) she has been involved in.I do not exaggerate by saying her performance in Trucker is truly phenomenal, and it is pity that it went so unnoticed by the awards and the film critics.Nathan Fillion also brings a precise and honest performance; Jimmy Bennett shows he is a solid young actor, because his performance feels organic; and I also liked the work from actors Benjamin Bratt (whom I rarely swallow) and Joey Lauren Adams.So, in summary, I would not consider Trucker to be an excellent film, but I liked it pretty much, and I recommend it mainly because of its honesty and its performances.It will be interesting to follow Mottern's career, because he shows potentia"
The House Bunny             ,robertallenandersonjr,1,comedy,2008,10,"The House Bunny was one of the funnest and freshest movies I have seen this year. It had many good laughs. That wasn't the best part of this movie though it was mostly the humor and Anna Faris. She did a terrific job playing the character of a playboy bunny. She gets kicked out of the playboy mansion because she was to old. Their were some fun unexpected turns this movie took. It was very cute and very fun to watch. Emma Stone was very good as well and she added a lot to this movie. She looked very good and was extremely funny. The whole movie was good. The cast was good as well. This movie didn't really have to many flaws at all that i can think of. I think in my opinion this was the best chick flick comedy I have seen. I would see this movie again just to see the cast and the funny comments they make. This movie had way more facial expressions and comments that will make you laugh. Anna Faris was definitely funnier than she ever has been in this movie. The visuals were very cool as well. This movie was fresh, original, funny, fun and very sexy. I would say go see this movie at all costs. Don't miss out on this one it was great. This was definitely a great chick flick for teen aged girls to see. Enjoy this one I know I sure did."
21             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,1,crime,2008,6,"21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie, a decent plot, over all a good combination of actors, and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed, I think this movie was more for the teenagers, with the actors and the rating, I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters. Kevin Spacey, seriously my favorite actor, he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on, but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot up-comer, Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen, but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs $300,000 for Harvard Med. School, he's extremely gifted with numbers, so when his professor, Micky Rosa notices his gifts, he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21. But there is a way to beat the game apparently, by counting cards. Ben promises up and down that it is just for school, but of course when he gets so hot, he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with.Now 21 has decent enough acting, the movie itself is decent, I didn't mind at all watching it. For the most part, it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention. My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up, I seriously doubt that would happen for real, but for the movie, they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake. Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught, yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes, clubbing, drinking, etc. 21 is worth the watch, but to be honest, if you're reading this, wait for the rental, it's just a regular rise and fall story.6/10 1"
Kung Fu Panda             ,Chrysanthepop,0,animation,2008,NA,"'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clichés. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kid"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,tsmith1999,0,animation,2008,7,"I read today a horrible review for this film by yet another jaded reviewer. It was by far one of the nastiest reviews I've read by one of these monkeys in a long time. Look, this is not a perfect film, but it is neither a bad film. So often reviewers seem to want all films to be Dr. Zivago or Gone With the Wind, or whatever is politically correct at the time. Point is, see movies for what they are intended to be. What a concept.So what is this film all about? It is a movie for kids that is in all honesty not up to Pixar standards, but not a bad film at all. The main purpose is to inspire a new generation of kids to explore and is very pro space exploration. It is so important to give young people something special to which they can aspire. As such, I think this film succeeds quite well. The 3D effects were very good, and definitely eye popping! So go and take they young ones, this is an event they will remember, and who knows, one day a man or woman may set foot on the moon or even Mars, and credit this film with inspiring them! That is what it is all about! The best review of this film came form a young girl, who as she exited the theater proclaimed to all, ""this is the greatest film ever!"". That review from the target audience pretty much says it all"
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,animation,2008,5,"Honestly, I did have a feeling from the trailer that Fly Me to the Moon wasn't going to exactly my style. But I had the opportunity to see it today for free and I just wanted to give it a fair chance, I don't know what's with this year, but it doesn't seem like all the animated films are gold, now we had WALL-E and Kung Fu Panda, that's about it when it comes to the good animated films, but then we had Space Chimps and now Fly Me to the Moon that are just average. See, what bugs me is that this movie is just for kids, I think we should have those kind of films, but this was semi-boring. The humor didn't even seem to exist, also flies are not cute or interesting to watch and just because a film is made for 3-D doesn't make it a great film. I'm not trying to hate on this film because the story is decent, it's just the way it's told that makes it a little dull.Nat, I.Q., and Scooter are young flies who are just day dreamers, but Nat dreams of going to the moon one of these days. When he talks to his adventurous grandfather, he decides to just go for it. He talks I.Q. and Scoother into it as well, they sneak onto the rocket ship that is taking Americans to the moon for the first time. But with the mothers freaking out at home and Russian flies who can't stand the idea of these American flies getting the credit, it may not be a happy trip home.Fly Me to the Moon is alright for the kids under 7, that's it. Like I said, I think we should have movies that are aimed for kids only, but this was just dull and didn't interest me. The humor is very tame and the characters aren't the best to relate too. There are a couple of nice things about the movie, like the animation is beautiful and the story is fun. Even though 3-D doesn't make a movie wonderful, it does make it a lot of fun to watch and a lot more interesting to look at. Over all, I'd say to see this as a matinée if you want to see it on the 3-D screen, otherwise, it's a rental, there's nothing special about it, but it's a nice movie.5/10"
The House Bunny             ,C-Younkin,1,comedy,2008,6,"""The House Bunny"" has a funny concept and what looks like a ""Legally Blonde"" form of execution. If Anna Faris, most commonly known as the one portraying/making fun of the Neve Campbell ""Scream"" role in the ""Scary Movies"" was ever going to become the next big female comedienne the time would be now. She showed she was willing to make fun of herself in those movies but I still wonder if she can play a sincere, actual human being rather than a character meant to be the punch line most of the time. ""Bunny"" was written by ""Blonde"" screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith so that could be good news but a lot of the weight of this movie is going to rest on the shoulders of it star. Reese Witherspoon made that movie what it was and the big question here is, can Faris do the same? She plays Shelley, a ditzy playboy bunny with big dreams of becoming the next centerfold who instead is tossed out on her ass by Hugh after her 27th birthday. Shelley went from the orphanage to the mansion so she never quite got the fill gist of the outside world. Now homeless and with very few survival skills, she has no idea what to do next. Just through happenstance, she encounters something that looks like a mini Playboy mansion but is in fact the best college sorority on campus. They decline her for house mother but she finds a home with the Zeta sorority, a group of misfit girls, led by Natalie (Emma Stone), who seriously need to improve their image and attract new members in order to stop the college from closing their house. Enter Shelley to give the girls make-overs.This movie made me laugh out loud twice. One involved the manhole cover joke in the trailer, and the other was a really good jab at Bob Saget. The rest of the movie is likable and has a nice message but really can't seem to wring that many laughs out of a good premise. It's a parody against the bimbo ideology, first having Shelley turn the girls into mindless, skimpy-looking prostitutes only to realize later that you also have to have substance too. Sometimes it gets a few chuckles and other times it comes off looking embarrassingly sitcom-ish, like when Shelley tries to look brainy to impress a guy by wearing very thick glasses that make her dizzy, but overall the script isn't as smart or funny as ""Legally Blonde"" and that hurts its chances. The movie also treats some of the secondary characters in really bad taste, like a girl whose such a misfit she actually talks like Frankenstein and walks like Igor, and I was confused by some others, like a girl who supposedly is bad with boys and yet is pregnant.I was also confused by the mental abilities of the main character. At times she seems dumber than dirt and at other times she seems almost profound. That she works regardless of this has less to do with the script and more to do with Anna Faris. I don't think this will be the star-making role I thought it would be for her but she gives Shelley a very sweet, genial nature and she is willing to throw herself into silly situations with an innocent and goofy charm. Emma Stone is also pretty funny in this movie, dialing up the dorky meter to about an 8. I feel bad for Colin Hanks though. This kid just doesn't seem to be getting many chances to shine, and here he's wasted as the romantic lead in a movie that's pretty low on the romance.""The House Bunny"" begins, middles, and ends like most college movies do, just unfortunately its not funny or clever enough to distract from the generic plotting. Most of the secondary characters are also wasted as well but maybe, it will put Anna Faris on some people's radars. She is a very funny comic actress and with the right script, its possible she could be the next big thing."
Gomorrah             ,godyaevs,,crime,2009,2,"Very boring movie as for me. Nothing interesting, just a movie about life. I knew all this stuff before, there was nothing new for me. Or maybe you don't know that in Naples many bandits and mafia gangsters? Or you don't know that mafia people kill each other? Maybe if this movie was made as a documentary movie it would be more interesting. You can watch me going to supermarket to buy food with same interest :) Another opinion why this movie is so boring is because the director is not professional. Maybe the book is much more interesting, but the implementation in a film really bad. Matteo Garrone just tore out some moments from the book and decided that he is a great director. Russians movies about mafia and all other stuff are much more interesting. So I advice you not to watch it and save 2 hours of your life ;) Watch ""Brat"" movie instead and you will dive into the Russian bandit's world...."
The Bank Job             ,nando1954,0,crime,2008,10,"I had a lucky opportunity to see ""The Bank Job"" at a special evening advance preview screening somewhere in the wonderful U.S.A., and I have to write that I think it is a very interesting and energetic movie. I am a fan of Jason Statham and I think this is the best work he's done on film, even better than ""The Transporter."" Usually Statham plays a bad guy or a guy with a bad streak, and this time is no exception. But I really got a sense of how determined Statham's character was to protect his family from the fallout from the legendary bank robbery. I also really like the incredible 1970s feel of the film - it was as if it had been made in the early 1970s, what with the great rock music, the depiction of the swinging sex scene in London, the perfect costumes, and just the general overall style of the movie's look. I also loved the pacing of the movie, which was quick and up-tempo. Things moved along really well. I also liked the movie's different plot elements and its understanding of how money can corrupt everyone, even the upper crust, and how a scandal must be dealt with to avoid shock to England's Royal family. The movie is fun to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It's definitely well-worth seeing. I don't know what movie the person who commented about the tunneling saw, but there was hardly that much tunneling - maybe a few quick scenes to establish things. They were in and out of the tunnel quickly. I never felt that the tunneling went on and on. And the pacing of the movie is so good that nothing drags or seems overdone. Statham's character reacted perfectly to everything that went on around him. This is a darn good movie, with good action and excellent acting. Saffron Burrows is very good and alluring and David Suchet really played the sleazy porno king very well. I would recommend this movie to fans of Statham, Burrows, and Suchet, to people who like caper movies, to people who like looking at London, and to people who enjoy the buzz that existed in the 1970s."
Mamma Mia!             ,neil-476,1,comedy,2008,10,"I like, but don't love, musicals - my DVD shelves contain a selection, but the stuff there is pretty obvious: Singing in the Rain, King and I, Wizard of Oz, Moulin Rouge etc.. I'm not a Meryl Streep fan - I admire her craft, but mostly haven't liked the parts she's played. Conversely, I've always liked Abba's music. So that's my starting point when considering this movie which I have just been to see with my 80-year old mother.The story is a piece of fluff. Sophie, who lives with her mother in a dilapidated hotel on an idyllic Greek island, wants nothing more than for her father to be at her forthcoming wedding. The trouble is her father could be any one of three men with whom her mother dot dot dotted twenty years ago. So Sophie invites all three of them to her wedding and, as expected, complications ensue. The story, such as it is, is quite strong enough to enable the songs to be hooked onto it. And the songs, with one or two obvious exceptions (Money Money Money cued by the rundown state of the hotel) are very cannily worked into the story so that each one is relevant.The film looks great. The Greek locations overflow with sun and primary colours. The script is mostly fairly deft, and there is a sprinkling of decent laughs.But the film ultimately stands or falls - and it stands, believe me! - on two things: the music, and the cast.The music - sitting through this film brings home the strength of the Abba catalogue. There isn't a weak song among the two dozen which feature on the soundtrack. The music, produced by composer Benny Andersson, mostly wisely sticks very close to the original arrangements, and the occasional divergences (Greek bouzouki on I Had A Dream, for instance) are spot on.And the cast - well, they deliver. Brosnan's singing has been criticised, but he is always in tune, and he delivers a satisfactory vocal performance rather than dazzling with a polished singing technique (which he hasn't got). The four leading women are all wonderful. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as Meryl Streep's two oldest friends are both very funny (Julie Walters has a particularly funny little bit of business in a rubber boat), and Baranski has her own knockout number. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is simply delightful - she sings well, carries the plot and all the emotion which goes with it, and is very easy on the eye. And Meryl Streep is a revelation.This film is an utterly joyous experience. My old Mum and I came out of the cinema buoyed up by the experience of watching it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys musicals and/or Abba's music. 2"

Filmmaker Kelly Reichardt <U+0096> who co-scripted with Jonathan Raymond <U+0096> depicts the harsh realities of a homeless woman's plight in attempting to maintain her dignity, stamina and self-assurance is only buoyed by Williams' bravura poignant turn speaking volumes in her nuanced depiction of a woman unknowingly journeying into despair"
Space Chimps             ,bloomer1158,,animation,2008,8,"It was funny, well written and very entertaining. I would recommend this flick to anyone whom has children. I took my two boys, ages 5 and 8 and it was better than I was expecting. With a name like ""Space Chimps"", I was really expecting that the movie would leave me feeling like a Space Chump. But both kids loved the movie and I thought it was reasonably entertaining. It had a number of decent jokes that the kids appreciated and I got a chuckle out of some of them. It won't win any awards, but in the name of entertaining the kids it was worthwhile.It is also a nice change of pace from all the shoot'em up, bring me down or make me cry type films... this is just fun and a good time to spend with the family movie"
Prom Night             ,galahad58,1,horror,2008,1,"This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot I rented the film) is discouraging also.Obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. HMM--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired. Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash."
Iron Man             ,ffiisshh,0,action,2008,10,"WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy! 4"
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull             ,gorosaur1,0,action,2008,10,"Ever since I heard about the possible release of new Indiana Jones film I was bursting with excitement and skepticism. THe original trilogy are some of my favorite movies of all time, and I still hold an opinion that Raiders of the Lost ARk is the best action picture of all time. However I was skeptical about how a new film would be pulled off. It wasn't Indy's age that worried me seeing as I have a very high respect for Harrison Ford, but I was worried about how George Lucas and Steven Spielberg might go about this new film. My worries were unfounded.The first thing people need to realize about the Kingdom of the Crystal SKull and all the Indiana Jones films is that they are and always will be period films. The idea for Indiana Jones was originally based upon 1930's serials, and the first 3 did good for that time period. However, Lucas and Spielberg both realized that due to Harrisons advancing age that the film needed to be place further into the future. (the 1950's) However, adventure serials weren't part of the film mainstream at the time. And Sci-fi films were. This is why Kingdom of the Crystal Skull truly ascends. The filmmakers made a B movie sci-fi fitting of the period, but also kept its original Indy flair. All the requirements for a good indy movie are kept. (the action pieces, the battles between Indy and a world power be it Russians or Nazis, the creatures, and the encounters with super natural.) Those who find the alien aspect of this film to be out of place only need to look at Lucas's and Spielberg's reasoning. (see above) And if they find the story of the aliens unrealistic then they honestly need to rewatch the original movies seeing as their is nothing any more unreal in this film then there were in the previous films. 10/10 Easily one of the best Indy films.

Righteous Kill             ,Argemaluco,0,crime,2008,4,"On this decade,we have mostly seen legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on mediocre or bad movies,where they are just worried on winning some more money.Righteous Kill is another movie in which these two actors are wasted.This is a very bad thriller which commits the fatal sin of being boring.It seems that director Jon Avnet and screenwriter Russell Gewirtz said : ""We have De Niro and Pacino.We do not need a good story"".That was wrong.The story from this movie is completely hollow and full of plot holes,not to mention it is painfully predictable.Come on,I predicted that ending like 30 minutes after the movie had started.Plus,this is a kind of story which has been seen too many times.On the supporting cast,there are good actors who are wasted (John Leguizamo,Donnie Wahlberg,the great Brian Dennehy and the underrated Carla Gugino).This movie was completely boring because it lacked of dynamism.In other words,everything felt pretty static.Righteous Kill is a very crappy cop flick which tells a story which does not produce any interest and is totally predictable.It is obvious that Pacino and De Niro have lost the interest in their careers.

Sex and the City             ,ameli-1,1,comedy,2008,4,"I am a big fan of the show. I am one of those people who have seen every episode at least 4 times, and some of them around 10 times. Even so, I still watch the reruns, and I was really looking forward to the movie.So, it is really upsetting that I have to give it such a bad review. I went to see it with the best of intentions. I really wanted to love it. Unfortunately the movie has nothing to do with the wittiness and character of the series. Even putting aside the wooden and/or exaggerated acting, you fail to recognize the characters who where transformed into caricatures, pathetic versions of themselves.There were very very few lines that gave a glimpse of the old clever dialog, and they all got lost in a mass of cheesy lines about love and friendship that you even rarely anymore encounter in the corniest of Hollywood's chick flicks, and toiler humor that you only expect from movies like Harold and Kumar. OK, maybe the comparison to Harold and Kumar is a little unfair, but really I had never expected Sex and the City to rely on fart jokes for comic relief.People comment that those who rate this movie badly are either men, or just not fans of the show. From my perspective the fans of the show should be the ones most disappointed by the travesty that was this film.We grew to love the show because of its honesty towards sexual issues, its shocking but clever dialog, and its characters who, however unreal with their designer obsessions, uncontrollable spending and lack of real jobs, remained true to their personas regarding sex, relationships, commitment, independence.The show was about sex. The movie is about love, and treats the subject from the weakest, corniest and most disappointing standpoint.This movie is a fake Fendi. Dropping 15 designer names in one sentence, showing bulging men's underpants and orgasming at the sight of huge closets, Sex and the City does not make.As for me, I will keep watching the reruns and pretend this movie never happened. 2"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,rzajac,1,comedy,2009,NA,"I normally do not go out for sappy, romantic roller coaster romantic fare; and Forgetting Sarah Marshall (FSM) pretty much falls under the romantic ""date flick"" rubric.And I can't, for the life of me, quite figure out why I liked this so much. I guess the filmmakers succeed in making the welter of comic bits, scenes, and images come across like genuine romantic sweet chaos. How they succeeded is beyond my comprehension.And maybe that's the point. Some films are good, some are bad, and some are sort of like miracles. Their power is inexplicable; and that's how FSM felt to me.It was boffo, a bit over-the-top, a tad muddled, a mix of character study, revelation, and farce. And, as things unfolded, by dint of pacing and sheer comic/character acting power, I came to really care about the characters; and I loved it! I glowed through most of FSM.Here's a way of looking at it: FSM was sort of like Shakespearean romantic farce. Maybe that explains why I liked it; because my mind already has a little engine for processing this kind of narrative stuff, built up from past experiences watching Shakespeare In The Park!It also comes down to artistic sincerity. Most romance flicks are a little insulting because they're not sincere. There was something, in the end, believable and therefore redeeming about the characters and their silly little Hawaiian comedy of errors and feints.And that's a miracle, in my book! This is not an ordinary date flick."
The Reader             ,alexkolokotronis,1,drama,2009,10,"The Reader is one of my favorite movies from the year 2008. It is incredibly complex in the way you react to the characters of the movie. It carries many emotions from sensuality to anger all the way back to that of sympathy and resolution. Many moves advertise themselves as unbiased and fair but nothing gets close to that like The Reader which is able to build sympathy for a character you would never think you could feel towards.The acting in the movie was phenomenal. Especially that of Kate Winslet who draws out many emotions from whoever is watching. She plays an ex-Nazi guard who has an affair with a 16 year old boy played very well by David Kross. Her bitter, cold attitude, random behavior as well as her past history seems unjustifiable and deplorable. Yet you can do nothing more than feel empathy and compassion towards the shame and humiliation she feels about her one well kept secret. In the course of her affair she ask for one thing, to be read to. From this do you see the humanity within her. Ralph Fiennes also gave quite a nice performance as an older Michael Berg who looks back on his life and then later finds a way to open himself up through his time of self reflection and sudden realizations towards life. David Kross plays the younger Michael Berg whose performance was undoubtedly a very good one, maintaining his presence in not letting himself being totally overshadowed. Overall the performances are very deep and will keep you thinking long after you have seen the movie.The directing and writing also was very key to the emotions felt in this movie. Every scene had to be done precisely and consistently to feel genuinely touched rather than feeling falsely drawn in. Stephen Daldry did that under his great subtle direction. The writing by David Hare allowed actors such as Ralph Fiennes, David Kross and of course Kate Winslet to give such stunning and deep performances and take the film to another level.I found this movie to be very compelling in many ways. The emotions felt here were not cheap gimmicks but that of feeling true sympathy and forgiveness towards what we would normally describe as something wrong, shameful and reprehensible. I can't remember another film that made me feel these emotions for a character especially after learning one startling secret after another. This film succeeded in ways that almost movie would likely fail in, it did not come off as generous or light but as remarkably fair as a film or any type of medium can get shedding light on both sides of the spectrum. This is a film that is amazingly thought provoking and will bring out the humanity within all of us and should not be missed. 1"
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,don_Django,0,crime,2009,NA,"I just rented the DVD the other night and was really excited. I had been looking forward to this film for a long time because of all the good reviews it had received..I was deeply disappointed. You can tell the main plot instantly, the characters are stale and not lovable at all. There isn't really any great attempts on humor in the film and the pace is very very slow.There are so many other movies about small local communities in all genres (Needful Things, Sleepy Hollow, Italiensk for Begyndere (DK), Hot Fuzz, the TV-show League of Gentlemen etc.) and Frygtelig Lykkelig is just not up to par.I'm sorry to say I can't recommend this movie.Try these Danish movies instead. They are guaranteed to make you laugh:Blinkende Lygter, En Kort En Lang, Grev Aksel, De Grønne Slagtere, I Kina Spiser De HundeIf you do watch this movie however, it will leave you with many unanswered questions and a feeling of unfulfillment and disappointment."
Four Christmases             ,news-597-255276,1,comedy,2009,1,"While we were watching this movie, and Lord knows it was God awful, we noticed in several scenes later in the movie, that Reese Witherspoon had a body double in several scenes. After watching it, it was obvious it was not the real Reese Witherspoon. Different facial expressions and different hair, absolutely was not Resse Witherspoon. I am ashamed I wasted over an hour with this non funny attempt at humor. Terrible says it best. It starts off with this lovey dovey mess where they spend all their time telling people how great not being married is, how wonderful it is to live without kids. They progress on to telling a story to others on how good it is not to be married. From there they lose a flight and have to spend time at their 4 parents for a Christmas with each one of them. It has two or three funny lines in the whole movie. Reese Witherspoon having an acting double in several scenes, made the movie that much worse. It was so obvious"
Pride and Glory             ,obsessive_disintegration,,crime,2008,7,"The plot of this movie is the fairly predictable (though always entertaining) idea of the corrupt cops against the good cops and the always-annoying injection of the nosy media. If it had been done by amateur actors, this movie wouldn't have been nearly as good.Edward Norton was absolutely STUNNING, blew me away. He's always been a favorite of mine but every role he's in continues to amaze me. There a scene where he's talking to a Spanish woman and his expression throughout the scene is the main thing that stuck out to me in the whole movie. There's just something in his eyes that draws you and sucks you in.Colin Farrell did an amazing job as well, as did Jon Voight. They managed to bring their characters more personality than I expected there to be. Especially Colin. Even though he played a such a bad character, there was something there in the way he was with his family and everything that still made me feel BAD for him.And though the f-bombs were sometimes distracting and the ending could've had more punch, overall I really liked this movie. 1"
"Surfer, Dude             ",Len9876,0,comedy,2008,8,"Surfing, dude? You bet! Woody Harrelson is an acting chameleon! Every time the camera lens focuses on him, he becomes a different character. I think that's what makes actors interesting, and Woody does it on the level of a skilled, consummate professional. In this film, Woody shows his comedic side, and he does it as his hilarious best! I'm very much impressed by Woody's versatility.What I like about this film is that it's laid back, you enjoy the scenery, the waves, and the babes. The film makes me feel like a surfer bum, and I enjoy every minute of it! Steve Addington (aptly played by Matthew McConaughey) has a dream to become a surfer in his very own, custom-designed kind of Eden. The continuity in the film is purposely confused, in order to give the viewer a feeling of Addington's initial frustration. His dream does not work out, to his satisfaction, in the film's beginning. But, thankfully, mid-way through the film a 'mermaid' saves the day, and Addington's dream sees a delightful 'climax' (if you'll forgive my unfortunate choice of words). Matthew has sex appeal, and he shows it, but not in a narcissistic way. Both Matthew and Woody show their love for the environment and, when the film ends, I just don't want to come home from the beach. It is obvious that Woody, Matthew, and the entire cast had a great deal of fun while making this film. It becomes a delightful and somewhat zany surfing party, and the viewer is cordially invited to participate in the fun. Unlike ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), there are no 'inside jokes'. Every move is caught by a camera lens, and the viewer is always 'let in' on each happening.The film takes me, personally, back in time. And, it is a such a refreshing memory! I can almost hear the Beach Boys singing, and 'the Gidge' (Sandra Dee) is no longer lost. This film is my kind of paradise, and I rank it an 8 out of 10. Grab a surfboard, smell the salty air, and let's go surfing!"
Wendy and Lucy             ,Chris Knipp,1,drama,2008,8,"Wendy (Michelle Williams) is a young woman down on her luck. Unspecified troubles have led her to make her way from Indiana to Oregon in a late-Eighties Honda Accord she's been told has a serpentine belt that isn't going to last much longer. Her sole companion is her golden brown mixed breed dog, Lucy (played by the director's dog, Lucy, who also was in her acclaimed first feature, Old Joy). She's headed for Alaska to make fast money in a Ketchikan fish cannery. In a park the first evening she hangs with some young people. One guy tells her she's got the right idea. There's good money up there in the canneries. He also admits he got drunk one night and had to flee his Alaskan job after wrecking a piece of conveyor equipment worth $100,000.She sleeps in the car, but is awakened by a guard (Wally Dalton) who tells her she can't sleep there and has to move the vehicle. It won't go. As the Cannes synopsis goes, from then on ""the thin fabric of her financial situation comes apart, and she faces a series of increasingly dire challenges."" Indeed, this is the case. Wendy already may not have enough cash to make it up to Alaska if all goes well (she repeatedly looks at a page where she calculates her dwindling supply of dollars). When the major car issue arises, she may not even have enough to feed Lucy with. The news she gets from the garage man (veteran actor Will Patton) is decisive, anyway. Then she has a bad encounter with a young store employee (John Robinson of Van Sant's Elephant and Lords of Dogtown), and from then on things slowly but surely go downhill. The end of the film is not the end, however. There's no knowing how life will go for Wendy. The power of the film, which is painful and devastating to watch, lies in its nearly real-time effect as it delineates the transition from one level of marginality to several notches down.Williams is quietly convincing, but not spectacular, in her performance as Wendy. By joint agreement, she plays Wendy, as Reichardt put it in a press conference, ""very buttoned-down."" The only person who seems to keep her from despair is the kindly security guard. Only once does she show violent emotion, after a terrifying encounter in the woods, which the director said may represent a vision of her future. Will she become like that crazy hobo (Larry Fessenden) herself, or just be thrown in with his kind? The film, which was shown in the Un Certain Regard series at Cannes this year, is the result of long planning by Reichardt, who lives in New York, including many miles logged in her car with Lucy by her side looking for locations. During the 21-day shoot, she knew the Portland settings so well she directed the DP on shots. The result is many classic images of generic regional Americana, vacant lots, drugstores, a supermarket, which in their colors and angles recall the poetically banal Seventies and Eighties color photographs of Stephen Shore, which is to say that there's a keen eye here. Reichardt seems to have a rare sense of how even white Americans very often come to live on the margins. In a time of economic crisis, this is a relevant story. The director, who confirms here that she has a distinctive vision, excels at careful observation and specific regional settings. The presence of the by now high profile Michelle Williams should help this second feature to gain Reichardt a larger audience.As with Old Joy, Reichardt's writing collaborator was Jonathan Raymond, who was an assistant to Todd Haynes on Far From Heaven. The film, based on a short story by Raymond, has been bought by Oscilloscope Pictures and will open at Film Forum in New York December 10th. It's part of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center, September 2008."
Twilight             ,evil_suger_plum_faerie,1,misc,2008,1,"Let's face it, the movie was a total let down. I had low expectations. Extremely low but the movie disappointed me even then. The amazing love story we all read in the books was transformed into a whiny preteen nightmare. There was chemistry between Robert and Kristen, there is no denying that, but I didn't feel the need that is in the books. They are supposed to be I-can't-live-without-you, take-me-forever, I'm-devoted-to-you-always in love (Unless you want to count that one incident in Eclipse, but let's face it, most of us don't) but all I saw was a bored vampire and an indifferent girl.The one thing that made me most angry was the complete disregard for the meadow scene. It is a VERY important part in the book where they pretty much declare themselves to each other. This meadow scene lasted all of 10 seconds and consisted of them staring at each other. They changed around the timing of the movie so much that it almost made no sense. Lets face it, the book was a good story but the writing wasn't up to par. It was pretty much written to be turned into a movie and the screenwriter obviously didn't realize that.Sure, Robert was smoking hot (don't lie, you saw the ray bands) but his performance of Edward was terrible. The first time Bella walked into the Biology class, I laughed at his expression as did most people in the theater (some of them were too busy squealing). His badly-covered up English accent was also laughable.Jasper was perfect, the person that made me laugh during the movie because if you looked, not at where the camera was focused, in most scenes you could see him lurking in the background and I think it fit his character well. Carlisle was cast to a T as were Esme, Jessica, Rosalie, Emmett and Alice. They all fit their parts well even if I imagined Alice a little bouncier, Emmett a little bigger and Rosalie a bit more bitchy.Oh, the camera work. I'm not denying it, I liked the flickers between scenes at times but after a while, it can give you a headache. The insane closeups did NOT do what they were supposed to (show the intensity) instead they made me where they were half the time and realize how much makeup the actors where wearing. Every time there was a close up on Robert, it was totally obvious he was wearing contacts. Seriously, look for the line.The one thing that was actually done really well was the climax with the ballet studio and James. The fight scene was pretty cool and I totally believed that James wanted to kill Bella right there. But, with every up there is a down. After James is killed and They are taking care of Bella, why couldn't Edward have been more upset? It's written right in the book that he all but cries when he sees her.The movie was hyped up to an extreme so it was obvious it would be a let down, I just didn't know how bad it actually was. I don't get why they couldn't do little things that would have made it a bit better; The biology class incident? Bella wearing blue? Why the hell did James have to bite her arm instead of her hand? Would that have been SO hard to change? All in all, go see it if you are a Twilight fan but be weary. If you aren't, stay away because you will not understand a thing that is going on. As I said in my title, somewhere, Edwards is rolling over in his hypothetical coffin (yes I know they don't sleep in coffins, or sleep period for that matter, but that's why it's hypothetical) 2"
The Merry Gentleman             ,Ed-Shullivan,,crime,2013,6,"I really enjoyed this movie for a couple of reasons. Michael Keaton played a really good hit man, and the movie style I thought was a throwback to the 1950's era movies that were crime related. The movie had that very dark and moody style, with a great edge to the movie style. It keeps you anticipating what is going to happen next. The movie also had a plot with the damsel in distress running away from her abusive relationship. You just knew her ex-lover was going to cross paths with her again at some point. I also thought Michael Keaton did an admirable job of directing himself in the movie, and providing his cast with opportunities to share the stage with him and also have a good performance. Bobby Cannavale played the frustrated and sometimes violent ex-lover, with a troubled soul. On the down side, the movie was a bit slow during certain parts, but the ending was better than I actually expected and was a nice surprise. This movie is well worth a watch and I would recommend seeing i"
Cook County             ,charles000,1,drama,2013,NA,"Whatever one might think about the content and context of this film, it is the truth. This is one of those exceedingly rare examples of filmcraft where everything was delivered about as perfectly as possible. The characters, the scenarios . . . the acting and direction is absolutely spot on.I know this world, the tweeker universe and the absolute nightmare that comes with it. The story that is utilized as the delivery platform is very credible, the characters as delivered are as real as it gets. If anything, aside from the entertainment aspect that this film might deliver, this should be an educational film for anyone who is even remotely tempted to step into this universe.

A Christmas Tale             ,emeiserloh,1,comedy,2008,8,"This one, however, is not for everyone. Most people will probably not only have trouble with its length, but its style, as well. Both as wild as it is imaginative, this film is like a post-modern jazz score, mixing elements from a variety of cinematic styles that are jarring (at times), but always interesting to behold. And as long as the film is, it always keeps moving and changing before our very eyes. What makes its odd stylistic combinations work is the compelling depths of its explorations into family and the bonds the unite, or divide us. Like and The Royal Tennenbaums, with a nouvelle vague twist, the film is not only full of odd combinations of image and music, but seems to jump from one film to another from scene to scene, as if each character or emotional quality (from light comedy to serious drama) were each receiving its own rendering. At times, the characters turn and speak directly to the camera. The filmmaker also intercedes by providing chapter headings and keyhole views, but, somehow, what could have become a cacophony of chaos, turns into a wonderment of cinema that any real cinephile will be amazed to behold and want to experience again...."
21             ,waltboyisme102,0,crime,2008,8,"After Reading Ben Mezrich's ""Bringing Down the House"", upon which this movie is based, I was excited to the movie. I am usually let down by movies that are based on books, but that was not the case this time.Although there were a handful of cliché parts of the movie, all in all it was excellently done. The visual effects were well done, and the acting on the part of Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, and Kate Bosworth, was exemplary. Some people may criticize Spacey for his 'gusto', but I believe his portrayal of Mickey was stellar.The movie had suspense, a solid plot line, scattered funny scenes, and a good ending. The people I went with, none of whom had read the book, found it an even better movie than I did. If you like the movie enough, I recommend reading the book for a more complete story. 1"
The Square             ,leos_monkey,0,crime,2008,7,"The Square co-written by Matthew Dabney and Joel Edgerton, directed by Nash Edgerton and produced by Louise Smith is brilliant and stylish. Along with the script and directing, the casting of unknowns like David Roberts (Ray), Claire Van Der Boom (Carla) and Hanna Mangan Lawrence work well with known actors like Joel Edgerton (Billy), Anthony Hayes (Smithy) and Damon Herriman (Eddie). This film deserves to do well so do go and see this and not just to ""support it"" but it really is a great film, story and the acting is brilliant which i think all the actors have a big future in this industry. I look forward to see what Nash and Joel do next, again this film is brilliant!!!"
The Square             ,billingtizard,0,crime,2008,10,"A bag of money, an illicit affair, and a decision that has disastrous effects plunge our protagonist into a downward spiral with more plot twists than a corkscrew. Written by actor Joel Edgerton (with co-writer Matthew Dabney) and directed by brother Nash this enthralling thriller had the audience at its 2008 Sydney Film Festival debut on the ""edgertons"" of their seats.The many surprising turns in the story are made completely plausible by a superb cast lead by David Roberts and including the actor brother. And check out the parallel relationship between the lovers' dogs and its surprising denouement! A very impressive first feature from a director whose short films have been widely acclaimed. If you like the Coen brothers films then THE SQUARE is for you."
The Duchess             ,chug_rocks,1,misc,2008,10,"Okay, so let's put this in context, if you don't like period dramas, don't go and see this movie, you probably won't like it, and it is NOT Diana's story, nothing like although some in the marketing department thought so ...But i love this film, having being dying to see it since the first teaser trailer. I love everything about it the costumes, the characters, the acting, the whole package.Keira Knightley in a corset again, but then i think these are roles she is good at, this role required her to have this real sense of melancholy to her and she did it beautifully. Ralph Fiennes is funny, repulsive and endearing in his role as the duke you feel one thing for him and then another, you can't write this guy off as anything in particular. All i know is that i wouldn't want to be married to him.I hope that both Knightley and Fiennes get their second and third Oscar nominations for this respectively, as they are well made parts.As for the others: Dominic Cooper, is lovely as Grey if perhaps a little underused, Hayley Atwell's character is again one you want to hate but really can't, and Rampling is great as the mother.All in all a great period flick, i say 10/10, but if i wasn't so into this kind of thing i'd probably still rate it quite highly, it is a fine piece of film-making."
Good Dick             ,innon,1,misc,2012,1,"The DVD box called it original and funny, but it was nether original nor funny, I can say it had just absolutely ridiculous plot with bad acting of the leading actors, dialogs making no sense and way too far from being even slightly realistic. Was watching it just to see how worse it can get because with every minute I felt that it can't get any worse but still it could. Watching it was physically painful and to survive it had to laugh at how idiotic it was. Boring and not moving anywhere. Can't even say anything about the human relationships portrayed in the movie because it has nothing to do with actual human relationships and whoever called it deep and meaningful has never seen good movies about relationships and has never had any healthy relationships in real life. Could survive it only because had someone to watch it with so we could mock it together"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,engelst,,adventure,2013,NA,"I don't know if you ever saw Threesome, a humorous story about an atypical triangle relationship. It's certainly not a masterpiece, but it does what it does with panache. It's fun to watch the confusion and somehow it's believable that two boys and a girl all have a thing for each other.The Mysteries of Pittsburgh also touches on the dilemma of bisexuality and sharing the same lover. However, here the setup is so bland that it seems to (involuntarily, of course) echo the clichés of people who have issues with homosexuality, namely, gays are confused/immoral and have too much libido for their own good.The film lacks clarity. Especially the beginning is a messy collage that fails to properly introduce the main character. The confusion becomes greater when more side characters show up. Nobody seems to know what he or she is doing in this story. The actors caught on to this, because their performances are colourless. Considering the 18 karat cast, the director is to blame.I add Mysteries to the long list of movies that failed because the people who made it thought that going off the beaten track would be enough to make a good movi"
Flash of Genius             ,sddavis63,0,misc,2010,7,"When it was over, my gut reaction to this movie was one of sadness. Yes, in many ways it was inspiring. It's nice to see the little guy (in this case, Dr. Robert Kearns, played by Greg Kinnear) come out on top. Whenever you see a David vs. Goliath story it's always nice to see David win. But at what price? The scene in this movie that really sticks with me has little to do with victory. It comes at the end. Kearns has won his court case and been awarded over $10 million from the Ford Motor Company after a jury ruled that Ford had stolen his idea for an intermittent windshield wiper. It should be a time for a grand celebration. But the journey has been a long one and a hard one. It cost Kearns his wife and almost his family. He reconciled with his children, but in that haunting scene, his ex-wife (whom he did love, and who did love him) congratulates him on having achieved everything he wanted and then simply walks down the halls of the courthouse, leaving him behind. His obsession with victory over his marriage made a reconciliation impossible. Director Marc Abraham filmed that perfectly, and got the point across: Kearns won - and he won a lot - but he also lost - and he lost big time. The whole movie, to me, builds up to that question - at what price victory? How much should we be willing to sacrifice to win - even if the victory is an important one, a serious matter of principle? Is there a point at which we should decide that the price of victory is just too high, or was Vince Lombardi right - ""winning isn't everything - it's the only thing!""Frankly, this isn't an exciting movie. It isn't going to lift you out of your seats at any point. The courtroom scenes don't have any ""You can't handle the truth!"" dramatic revelations or admissions. It's actually pretty simple and straightforward; some might even call it dull at times. But this isn't a movie that you watch for excitement. It's a thought provoking movie. It's a movie about principles and values. It's a movie that makes you wonder just how far you would go to fight for what's right, even if you had to give up the most important thing in the world to do it. I'm not saying Kearns was right or wrong. He answered those questions for himself. I'm just not sure that I would have answered them in the same way. But a movie that raises such a thought provoking issue - even if it isn't the most exciting movie you'll ever see - is worth at least a 7/1"
The Express             ,pampeachtree,,misc,2017,8,"Enjoyed the movie but for purist there were many factual inaccuracies. Syracuse did not play Boston College in 1959. The West Virginia game in which WV and their fans are portrayed as very racist was played in Syracuse not Morganton. In the Texas game of that year the score was never 15-14. There are others but that suffices. When a description is ""based"" on a true story it means not everything is necessarily true. Remember that as one videographer told me, ""we are artists and entertainers and not historians"
Stop-Loss             ,sf_knight,0,drama,2008,3,"As a big fan of Kimberly Peirce's ""Boys Don't Cry,"" I went to a sneak preview of ""Stop-Loss"" with positive expectations. However, despite its good intentions, this film is a muddled mess. It cobbles together a narrative that feels false and arbitrary given the particular group of soldiers the story focuses on. A group of lifelong friends from a small Texas town (which is itself portrayed in about as clichéd as an outsider's imagination of a Texas small-town could be) come back and all suffer shell-shock and trauma, as one might expect. However, Ryan Phillippe's character, expecting to be finished with his duty, reacts to the news that he is being ""Stop-Lossed"" (sent back on another tour of duty) by instantly breaking from every fiber of his upbringing. In about 90 seconds, he is a different man, rebellious, ready to run. Soon he is picking fights and wobbling dangerously close to uncontrollable Rambo territory even as we are supposed to believe that he has an unassailably correct belief that he shouldn't be forced to go back no matter what the military says. Unfortunately Phillippe (who had seemed to be becoming a better actor in 2007's ""Breach"") tips his hand here and reveals his limited range (not to mention a horrifically fake sounding Texas twang). Phillippe's equally unbalanced yet more ra-ra lifelong bud is played with an even more limited range of emotions by former (though-should-probably-have-stayed-a) model Channing Tatum, who admittedly does have the good sense to avoid even attempting a Southern accent here. Even poor Joseph Gordon Levitt, who has proved himself an able and promising young actor in several recent films), is reduced to seeming tinny and unconvincing here.The paper-thin story sends Phillippe uselessly careening across the U.S. accompanied by his best friend's fiancée, an unconvincing device that accomplishes little. There are also lots of badly executed sequences of these fugitives driving and hiding, not to mention loads of clunky, repetitive dialogue that never gets us to the soul of these men who are supposedly suffering. In an example of unbridled directorial excess, the story even gets broken up several times by jarring, wholly unnecessary 'soldier videos' that supposedly mimic those created by the boots on the ground, but which look more professional than many music videos today and feel really inauthentic. Plus, they yank us out of the story again and again, and after awhile, it's hard to go back into it.The ending is doubly unsatisfying in that, after forcing these characters to do fairly extreme things that their real-life counterparts would not do, and after making it very clear that we are supposed to be viewing Phillippe as the beleaguered hero on a quest to right a wrong no matter what the consequences, the movie turns on its heels and abandons all that in a flash. The characters and the movie end up where they started, and the audience, who has been shoe-horned into viewing Phillippe's rebellion and journey as something to root for, are abandoned. The director has forced us to slog along on this narrative road for two hours, and as an emotional viewing experience, the ending (even if it is supposed to say something about the inassailability of the military machine) pulls the trap door on us.The director was present at a Q&A after the film, and she spoke about how she created these characters after talking to a lot of different real-life soldiers back from Iraq & Afghanistan. The film really feels like that -- and not in a good way. It is a patchwork of observations about the shell-shock of returning home without any real commitment to one set of lives. Peirce's ""soldiers"" are overstuffed amalgams who drink and yell and fight and shoot and even cry, but don't breathe."
The Tale of Despereaux             ,valleyjohn,0,animation,2009,8,"After waking up with my usual January the 1st mother of all hangovers i wondered how i would manage to grab some recovery time in the form of some extra shut eye later on in the day? Bingo! why not take the family to the cinema? I great place to catch forty winks , or so i thought. Little did i know i would find a kids film that was so good , sleep was the last thing on my mind.A long time ago, in the distant kingdom of Dor, A horrible accident broke the heart of the king, left a beautiful princess crestfallen, and filled the townspeople with despair. As the sun disappeared from the sky and the flowers were drained of color, the laughter slowly ceased in this once-magical land. It was into this darkened world that a tiny mouse named Despereaux Tilling was born, and while this virtuous little rodent may have been short in stature, his bravery was ultimately too big for such a small world to contain. An unlikely hero with over-sized ears and a discernible wheeze, Despereaux was taken with tales of chivalry, and longed to one day become a noble figure among his people. Sometimes in order to realize their true destiny, heroes must first experience great hardship, however, and when Despereaux fails to adhere to the rigid rules of his society, he is banished from DorI don't review Children's films very often . Maybe that's because they are on all the time in my house and i don't really take a great deal of notice of them.To be honest i didn't even know of The Tale of Despereaux until i checked the listings but I'm glad i did.This is a magical production that has a mesmerising story , some delightful characters and animation of the highest quality. It reminded me a little of some of the fairy tale books i used to read as a kid. The narration by Sigourney Weaver was perfect. It helped my children understand exactly what was going on when there was two or three sub plots going on.The Characters voices are performed by Dustin Hoffman , Emma Watson , William H Macey , Tracy Ullman , Kevin Kline and Matthew Broderick but to be honest i only recognised the voices of Hoffman and Watson during the film.It does make you wonder why studios pay massive wages to big film stars when a lot cheaper alternative could be used.If you stuck for something to do before the kids go back to school next week you wont go far wrong if you take them to see The Tale of Despereaux .Without a doubt this is the best film i have see this year......and its also the first!8 out of 10"
"Surfer, Dude             ",BigBTheOneNOnly,0,comedy,2008,8,"Hey. I saw that the people below were not happy with the movie. But personally I wonder if these people are just not getting what the movie is about. At first I thought the movie didn't make sense, and perhaps the scene order was a little off. But this movie is pretty much like Superbad in that it is more like everyday life turned upside down, and that the movie follows Steve Addington's (Matthew McConaughey's) journey as a surfer desperate to want to live in his own paradise.The jokes are a bit stereotypical, but I think that is what makes it so humorous. The situations are more funny then the actual dialog. Trying to see Woody Harrelson act like a beach bum was pretty hilarious in its own right! All and all, if you like a movie that is an offbeat comedy that tries something new, then you will love this movie! "
Summer Hours             ,pivic,1,drama,2011,9,"This is quite the solemn experience, much like Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"". A family gathers around the grand-mère of the family in the country, the keeper of artwork by a great, late artist. She keeps telling her children what should go where once she's gone, too. The family image is special, and the direction is sublime in the extreme; where my Hollywood sense of watching films is painfully blown-up, I felt that this film told it like it should be, in a way; it took me on a journey. I could not help but feel that part of it was filled with symbolism and free will, real characters and a sense of laissez-faire. The direction is so very simple, yet I think it's sleight of hand; it's probably really hard work behind this. All in all: beautifu"

In my opinion the movie deserves the 8 points, after I read how hard was the shoot of the last dance .. in the rain... and after I saw the movie and the great dances I think this movie deserves a High opinion... I would recommend it to people who want to get away for an hour and a half.. I enjoyed every minute of it.... the actors had some weak points, but all in all they did a good job to present the protagonists in the movie and they did a GREAT job with the dancing scenes!"
W.             ,jonygitar,0,misc,2010,3,"Oliver Stone is responsible for more misinformation than any film-maker I can recall. Here Stone attempts to squeeze every Woodward or Susskind anonymous-quoted source completely out of context, out of space-time.......Brolin does a good job acting. The father/son stuff is interesting.The casting of Rove for example with that imp is really poor choice and speaks to Stone's contempt for these people. Bush himself is a vastly more intelligent and complicated character.People really do ""misunderestimate"" him. The Gomer Pyle quote, the ""childrens learn"", Bush's view of his mistakes, all of it, wrong place wrong time wrong context. All these quotes come from books with unnamed sources. it's as if the writer had a clipboard and flash cards and just inserted quotes willy-nilly like mad-libs into spots that make no sense, a State of the Union becomes a news conference for example.......As far what Stone has done to impressionable malleable minds of American youth who get news from the Daily Show, mostly I believe Oswald acted alone and the facts bear that out, JFK, the film, has perverted millions of people into nutty conspiracy theories that have been rationally debunked.....and that's what I feel about Stone's lack of honesty. He is a master film-maker in particular super-charging a narrative and use of slight-of hand editing and you really need to watch him closely or you might believe Hoover poolside with a gay boy pulling strings on Nixon for example......I wait on pins and needles to see what he does with Hitler and Stalin. Stone has hinted that Hitler needs to be humanized..... Oliver Stone is simply one of the most dangerous people alive with the power to influence millions of minds of people that don't read source material.."
The Strangers             ,terrible2,,horror,2008,5,"Like many, I went into this (knowing) the basics of the story. That being said, I found the first half of the film quite suspenseful and creepy by modern movie standards. The story begins by developing the relationship between it's two stars, then separating them and introducing the terror. This worked, and worked very well in it's ability to set up (and scare the hell out of) the viewers. Unfortunately, after we have established what is taking place, the story seems to slow to a simmer, and eventually fizzles out. The second half of the film is filled with horror movie cliché's and cheap scare tactics, almost to the point of boredom... It's a shame, because I haven't been a fan of slasher films since the eighties, and I REALLY wanted to ""Like"" this film.My recommendation would be to watch the first half of the film, then go and sit by yourself in a cabin, somewhere in the woods. The effect would be much better, and the film would serve it's purpose. 2"
The Strangers             ,cromano_53,,horror,2008,NA,"This movie was flat out horrible. I went to see this movie and the whole theatre laughed at this movie for its horrible pop-ups and lack of plot, violence, and acting. I understand the whole ""This could happen to you"" appeal of the movie but at least work on some good scary moments. Not to mention the main villain sounds like a retarded 6 year-old. Finally the scene in which the Christians give the killers some pamphlets was a completely pointless scene which added nothing to the film what soever and was a waste of 2-4 minutes of my life, even more so than the rest of this movie.

Step Up 2: The Streets             ,pregnantreplies,0,misc,2008,7,"This movie gets a 7 in my book, and sure some of you may find this overtly and outrageously generous but I'm commending solely the power of the climactic dance scenes. This movie, just like Step Up (towards which I have similar feelings) has some of the most atrocious acting I've ever seen, and the ill-placed jokes were slightly less than totally idiotic. The tried-and-true method of uncanny coincidental run-ins is getting a little worn, also. So if you manage to ignore this crucial mistake, I promise you may actually enjoy the vibrant twists and turns of some of the best choreography I've ever seen in a dance film."
Summer Hours             ,diane-34,1,drama,2009,9,"What a near perfect movie! We watched this intellectual, insightful film this afternoon and both of us immediately put it into our ""memorable"" set of movies that will stay with us for years. As with most French films that I have seen, it is a knowing, gentle examination of those terribly mundane events that humanity passes through on its way to a new reality. I wish other filmmakers could metamorphose reality into an art form beyond the real; the French seem to have this very unique ability to instill greatness into something that is experienced by all of us but the magic lies in the examination.What a mundane tale: three kids dividing up their mother's estate; what could be more common but in the hands of an excellent director and actors, the story becomes knowing and gentle and for the audience, something delightfully memorable. The editing of the script's time frame through months before and after the mother's death becomes critical to the seamless flow of the story and I believe the director's hand plays a knowingly large role in the eventual beauty of the outcome.I believe this film to be one of those beautiful movies that deal with the extremely delicate subject of the passage of time and I would highly recommend i"
Bolt             ,anniemations,0,animation,2008,10,"I watched this at a screening w/ the directors. it was completely totally awesome. =] I had an awesome time. The movie was fantastic. I saw some of the production work (final and storyboard) phase of the movie and I could tell already that this movie will touch the hearts of many and especially pet lovers.The film - I really enjoyed the beautiful lighting and how Disney just blows the minds my mind with it. The different colors used to set the moods, the different palettes at different locations, the patter, and etc to set the environment as he travels across N. America. I can see the old traditional side of Disney is coming back especially with John Lasseter heading up the creative side. The color to this movie really does set the mood and the beautiful details and painterly affect developed by Disney really made the movie just much more unique and emotional... with the soft brush effects.You should not go into this movie criticizing it because of Miley or what not... or whatever... go in open minded. =] the movie will take your breath away. Especially the action scenes at the beginning of the movie - completely astounding and breathtaking.I love the script it was creative and it really hits the heart and soul. As much as this story has changed throughout the production... it still stays true to the main theme. The movie brought tears to my eyes during the climax of the movie when Bolt realize he was not a dog, or when Mittens tells her past life... the movie in itself has so much depth. The entire Vegas scene (Vegas being fake... etc etc.) It really takes you on this journey across North America and you can really emotionally feel what Bolt is going through as he travels and seeing that open landscape... what is real. (pay attention to Bolt's fur color as he travels across N. America. =] They put a lot of thought process into this.) The composition of the movie was great I loved it. the camera angles used was awesome. I think Chris and Bryon and the rest of the creative team did a wonderful job. they put a lot of thought into the characters and its development. Again, the character development in this film did meet its marks. I loved the animation and the subtle movement of the ears on the animals. I loved the anticipation to it and just everything about the Animation... it was mind blowing. I loved the jokes they were very creative. I would go say more, but I'll leave it short and simple. =] You just have to watch this film"
Iron Man             ,jaredmobarak,0,action,2008,8,"There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick<U+0085>let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years. 2"
Bolt             ,aes64,0,animation,2008,10,"We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool!All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie. Skip Bond and see Bolt. "
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,screenwriter-14,,adventure,2009,NA,"MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH is a truly 2009 ""coming of age"" story of three young people who meet in Pittsburgh and take a journey which will change their lives forever. The cast is superb; and I found Jon Foster's voice and performance refreshing inside a seasoned cast of Nick Nolte, Sienna Miller, ""American Beauty's"" Mena Suvari and the incredibly talented Peter Sarsgaard. Reviews have been mixed on the film, but I thought it took off in the second act, with humor of the challenges facing the characters, and the pathos of how ""love"" can take a turn when you least expect it. The dialog, at times witty and with a cynical barb to it, and the location of Pittsburgh, with its hills and older homes, adds to the story. I really liked this film, and once again, the cast is delicious to look at, and watch."
Gomorrah             ,dazski,,crime,2009,2,"I read a 5 page review of the book in the Guardian (online) and as such I was very keen to see Gomorrah <U+0096> unfortunately the end result was not what I was expecting.The most interesting part of this film was the text at the end stating some quite staggering facts related to the Camorra <U+0096> maybe if they'd focused the story around those facts the film would be a lot less dull than it is.Why did this need to be 2 hours long? They could have wrapped this up in 1 hour without any loss of content or message.This film would have had a much greater impact (and could have retained its focus) if it were a documentary <U+0096> though I can understand that would have been far more difficult to produce.I would have much preferred to see the intricacies of the top end of the organisation rather than seeing low rent Gangsters killing each other over territorial squabbles <U+0096> there was nothing new or ground breaking in what was shown and in my opinion it was shown in a format that can only be described as amateurish.The lap dance scene was a cheap shot <U+0096> a snatched opportunity to show some naked women. Of course low rent gangsters will go to lap dance clubs but was there any artistic worth displaying full nudity <U+0096> no, not really is the honest answer. The scene could have delivered its message (which I assume was to reinforce the immaturity of the two young protagonists) with a couple of topless dancers. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude (far from it) I just don't like cheap shots & lazy film making<U+0085><U+0085>..However, the biggest surprise for me was reading some of the reviews on IMDb <U+0096> some people actually seemed to enjoy this dull piece of uninspired film making, guess there's no accounting for taste!"
The Dark Knight             ,rustyalex2,0,action,2008,10,"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great! 1"
The Express             ,tburke85,,misc,2009,9,"The Express is an excellent movie based on a true story about the life of college football hero Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. For those of you who haven't seen it I won't say anything else about the movie. Because The Express is one those movies you don't want to know too much about before seeing it. I'm glad I didn't know too much about it because I was very impressed with this one because the Express was definitely much better than expected. The film does a great job of making you care about Ernie and most of the other characters who may not be in it much but they make the best of their limited screen time. The whole cast turn in great performances especially Rob Brown as Ernie Davis and Dennis Quaid as his tough but sympathetic college football coach. The rest of the supporting cast are admirable in their roles too. Mostly everything in this movie worked from the intense realistic football sequences to the drama of Ernie's inspirational life. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the film made up for it's one flaw. Overall The Express was so much better than expected and is a movie based on a true story that deserves to be told which is brought to life because of the exceptional performances by the cast. Well done"
Changeling             ,BJBatimdb,1,misc,2008,5,"I liked this movie less and less the longer it went on. Eastwood is an interesting director but his biggest fault lies in his inability to see the woods for the trees. Like the latter-day Spielberg, he just can't bear to end the movie or at least cut out scenes which stretch the patience. There are long, tedious swathes of this movie (the hearings at the end, the trial of the killer) which could have been drastically edited or (in the case of the outcome of the hearings) cut completely and dealt with in text at the end of the movie or in a far more succinct denouement.Conversely, there are parts of the story dealt with so briefly that they are simply confusing. The reason why a small boy would pretend to be a missing child, how he got the idea and who encouraged him are inadequately provided, and the solitary scene of the boy being left as collateral in a diner is scant compensation.It's a testament to the slightly unfocused film that I felt it necessary to read more about the real case online when I got home, just to fill in the gaps. In my e-travels I found an interview with the screenwriter who says he didn't want to glorify the heinous crimes which formed part of the story, but wanted to focus on the personal tale of Christine Collins and her disappeared son. That's all very well, but it was only really in the scenes involving the crimes that the film really felt alive and driven, instead of melodramatic and pedantic. If I had to see Angelina Jolie slap her heart and shout 'I want MY son!' one more time, I'd had have wanted a refund. Or earplugs.Jolie has had loads of plaudits for her role and she was good - but I found her lips so distracting that I can hardly judge. Against a muted 'period' palette, her scarlet protuberances - often in the act of grief-induced quivering - intrude like two giant red jellies in a pot of porridge.This is not a bad film - parts of it are very good and some of it is shocking. But someone needs to let Clint Eastwood know the line between drama and melodrama, taking time and tedium, and attention to detail and pedantry.I would have given it a 6 but I'm giving it a 5 in an effort to drag the ridiculously high score down to a sensible level as quickly as possible."
W.             ,WriterDave,0,misc,2008,8,"With his ""in the moment"" biopic ""W."" the normally volatile Oliver Stone wisely saves his judgments for history when hindsight will be 20/20. Achingly subdued and slightly satirical, Stone plays it straight and to the bone. Here he presents us with the early years of our current lame duck president, showing Dubya rushing a frat-house at Yale, meeting Laura at a barbecue, living in the shadow of his father and brother, his troubles holding down a job, his failed bid to become baseball commissioner, and his defining moment when he gives up drinking and becomes born-again. All of which leads us to his first term and the Iraq War quagmire, where Dubya honest-to-goodness truly believes ""God"" wanted him to become president and that Iraq did have those rascally WMD.In the lead role, Josh Brolin is an endearingly bumble-headed Dubya, and Stone presents him as a simple-minded man with good intentions who has been crippled by his ""daddy issues"" and has surrounded himself with the most cynical, self-serving, and corrupt administration in modern American history. The supporting cast is a hoot, with highlights including Thandie Newton eliciting big laughs just with her facial expressions as a wicked and moronically faithful Condi Rice, Elizabeth Banks giving a winning portrayal of Laura Bush, and Richard Dreyfuss playing Cheney as the most insipid megalomaniac American politics has ever seen.Stone accomplishes three major coups here that should surprise those who expected a one-sided liberal smear job. First, he humanizes George W. Bush. The director does this with savvy editing showing the back-story of why Dubya does the things he does (i.e. why he uses nicknames for everyone or why running three miles every day is so important to him), and then juxtaposing that with the inane decisions he has made as president. By utilizing actual transcripts from press conferences, news coverage, and meetings, Stone and scribe Stanley Weiser allow Bush and his administration to speak for themselves, and it's both comically cathartic and occasionally frightening to see it dramatized so well. Second, he redeems the presidency of George ""Poppy"" Bush (a somewhat miscast but still effective James Cromwell) by showing what a restrained and thoughtful Commander in Chief he was compared to his naive and too-eager-to-please son. Thirdly, he redeems the legacy of Colin Powell (a surprisingly good Jeffrey Wright), who is shown here as the only person in the administration with any hindsight or foresight, and the only sane voice who questioned the motives for entering Iraq, though he eventually caved in and played along. His ""f-you"" to Cheney towards the film's final act is priceless.As the actual presidency still has a few months to go at the time of the film's release, Stone's biopic was never written a true ending, leaving us with a symbolic image of Dubya looking up to the sky in center field waiting to catch a ball that will never drop. It may be another twenty years before we can pass any accurate judgment on Dubya's legacy, and likewise, Stone's film will have to wait. It's going to be a long time before anyone catches all those balls George W. Bush's administration threw up in the air. 1"
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh             ,dbborroughs,,adventure,2009,NA,"Young man with a gangster for a father is studying for the exams to become a stock broker. He doesn't really want to go in that direction but that's the direction that his father has picked out for him (he's arranged a job for him once he finishes). Desperate to have his own life he has taken a dead end job at a local book supermarket just to have time for himself before his life stops being his own. After almost being run over by his college roommate he ends up at a party where he ends up meeting a beautiful blonde, who along with her boyfriend ends up changing his life.This is a well acted, except by Nick Nolte, story based on a book by Michael Chabon. Its much better than its soiled reputation would indicate. The film is infamous for being the film Sienna Miller took simply to get away from the paparazzi, she got into even more trouble by bashing Pittsburgh in several off handed comments. It was then barely released to theaters before being dumped on to DVD. This is a good little film. I liked it. My only real complaint outside of Nick Nolte's performance (it just doesn't work here) is that the film is trying way too hard to be quirky. Its not bad, but there are these small turns and asides (Joe Namath's picture during a sex scene) that didn't really need to be there. I'm sure they were in the novel, but at the same time in the real world of the film they come across as out of place. Worth a look, probably on cable"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,eaeandaje,,animation,2008,NA,"I just got back from seeing this movie, which I went to see without my children because I wasn't sure how they would handle it. We are die-hard VT fans, but I was worried that the movie might be too intense for my three-year-old. The level of ""scariness"" is higher than in any other VT, and although it is a great, fun movie, (with an awesome if not hit-you-over-the-head obvious message), if your children are easily frightened I might wait until this one comes out on DVD. Put it this way: if you're such die-hard VT fan that pretty much the only TV your children watch is VeggieTales? This movie might scare them. If your children cried about the furnace in The Asparagus of La Mancha, this movie could be way too much for them to handle.Waiting for the DVD"
What Happens in Vegas             ,richard-702,1,comedy,2008,7,"When I think of the RomCom genre I see 2 people meeting by accident, not getting along, circling around each other for 1 hour and then in the end, by magic, finally seeing the beauty in each other and living happily ever after. Im not saying that this movie is all that better or even different from that, but its one of the few in the genre that actually made me laugh out loud a couple of times.The story is pretty plain, 2 people have to go on with this drunken Vegas marriage to get the 1,5 million each that they won, they struggle hard to make the other one give up on it. This is the setting for most of the film and it gives the viewer some really familiar every day situations pushed to the extreme, the interaction between Cameron and Ashton is working out well all through the movie, they really seem to be having fun acting their parts.I don't understand why this movie is at a 5.1 rating, sure its nothing new, sure its not the best storyline you have ever seen, but its good clear fun if you are looking for just that, nothing more nothing less."
The Objective             ,asad-ijaz,,horror,2008,8,"What else do you expect from ""Blair Witch Project""'s director. A true gripping, suspenseful, thriller drama that leaves a few bits hanging lightly to viewer's imagination.This movie has a perfect beginning to become a suspense masterpiece. The setup, the music, the acting, everything comes together throughout the movie... till the end. It seems as if the director and his team were going for greatness and then decided to be normal in the end... maybe it was shortage of funds or ideas.. who knows.No matter what the others say about the movie, it is one that shouldn't b missed. A true worthy entertainment."

The plot itself is based very loosely on events that occurred in the 1970s in London. The royal family has some dark secrets. An outspoken activist/petty criminal/drug importer has evidence of these secrets, which he uses as leverage against the government who desperately wants to prosecute him. This evidence is stored in a safety deposit box within a London bank. British Intelligence conjures up a rather reckless plan of employing a bunch of two-bit/amateur criminals to break into the vault, and take the evidence along with whatever else they can carry out. Apart from one intermediary, none of the robbers know the government's secret agenda. Of course, things get complicated whenever the possibility that a bunch of dirty secrets are in the wrong hands, and eventually the movie juggles several interconnecting plot lines, all related to the contents of the vault and their implication on various interests from the royal family, to corrupt police, to the sexual indiscretions of parliament members.The movie keeps a good pace and never takes itself too seriously. It builds up the plot lines and tries somewhat successfully to tie everything together. There is some good tension, a bit of violence (not much), and eventually, vindication for most of the parties.The problems with the movie are numerous, but nothing that ultimately destroys the fun. Yes the movie is rife with inexplicably, unnecessary side characters (see female undercover agent in the Caribbean). Yes the movie's dialogue veers into indecipherable 1970s British slang, which gives a comedic undertone to conversations that are intended to be serious. Yes there exist rampant plot issues that make you wonder how stupid cops really are. And yes the acting is OK, at best, lets face it Jason Stracham is meant for British caper movies the way Keanu Reeves is meant to play a clueless surfer cop in Point Break - so while he's not winning any Academies, he fits these rolls just fine.You could wait for the DVD, or if you are looking for a fun way to kill 2 hours, you should go to the theater for this one."
Wendy and Lucy             ,Quinoa1984,1,drama,2009,9,"Some of you in movie-land may remember Umberto D, the masterpiece of neo-realism that still keeps Vittorio De Sica, along with the Bicycle Thief, relevant in classic film courses. It was all about a man and his dog, and how that bond superseded so much more of the petty crap that blocks in the way of simple story and character in movies. Because, in the case of Wendy and Lucy its direct descendant, all we can care about is the woman and her dog, and this raises the stakes of what to expect. The director, Kelly Reichardt, follows De Sica's moral ideology if not the same sort of approach with the characters. This is about a woman who is leaving behind a dead-end existence with her sister and brother (who, in just one brief scene with her talking to them on the phone, convey all we need to know) to go to Alaska for some better tomorrow working on a fishing boat. There's no big grand plan, just with her dog and enough money to make sure she's not completely a bum of a drifter.What makes it such a touching story is Reichardt's unwillingness to put contrivance in the way of her character and surrounding. Wendy's struggle is something palatable even if her journey to Alaska won't be: many of us have tied up a dog while going to do something in a store, and then the worry that comes of getting back to the dog in time before something happens to him/her. In the film, Wendy does make a mistake, of shoplifting a can of dog-food, but the price she pays is excessive: her dogs runs away while she's being held by the police, and her search for the dog has echoes of the De Sica film in its tone of stripped down, no BS drama, and even in some details. It's impossible not to think of the former film when she goes to the pound to see if her dog is there, and then we get a remarkable, unflinching tracking shot going across all of the dogs that are there, unattended or soon to be put down, and there's another level of horror we feel because we can identify with this situation.We also get with Wendy and Lucy one of the most, if not just the most, incredibly contained, restrained, but extremely intense performances from Michelle Williams. She's been building up to something like this, and she goes wherever the director wants to take her. It's great to see a very plain, ordinary woman who still has great concerns and fears and keeps going along, trying her best to not break down in tears, whether it's at the police station or when roaming the streets for her dog or putting down her coat and pieces of clothing in case the dog goes by, or even in front of the one slightly helpful (or just sympathetic) person in the old guard by the Walgreens. I really admired how much she dug into this kind of character, not making her ever a real cliché, just an independent person who has fallen on some dark times without the one she loves. We can feel this person without knowing a whole life-story, and that's a credit to Williams maybe more-so than the writing.Wendy and Lucy has neo-realist roots due to the obvious comparisons, but it also has its own independent voice because of the nature of how she's traveling and why she's traveling. It's about what is important to a person, be it a dog or a job or a car or a way to live one's life, no matter how much one has to walk. It's a powerful picture that fans of indie cinema should go gaga for, though it asks for some patience on a viewer's part for the relatively short running time"
College Road Trip             ,sassyprettyncute,1,adventure,2008,7,"I saw this movie when it came out and it was so funny! It was kind of stupid in a few scenes, but wow, it was one of the funniest movies! I love Raven in this, she was the perfect pick! I can't imagine anyone else playing her character. Also Martin Lawrence's character isn't exactly how some dads are. But still, he did a great job betraying an over protected, police dad. And this is his first G-rated film! Can you believe it? So anyways, I loved this movie. Donny Osmand's character and his daughter are so annoying but that makes it even funnier! I loved it when at the end the daughter of Donny goes to the same college as Raven and they're neighbors! So funny. Loved the movie and the plot line wasn't the best. I know this won't be Golden Globe or Oscar worthy, but it'll definitely be nominated the the Teen Choice awards and/or at the MTV movies awards. If it doesn't get those nominations, I'll be kind of surprised. Anyways, if you want some good family fun, go see this movie! It's worth it!"
Surveillance             ,robbierobinson,1,crime,2009,1,"This P.of S. was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great(similar to mine) taste in films and have seen more than anyone I know.I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic,cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie,but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making.Or is it lowbrow highbrow?The ancient generation gap cliché ""no redeeming social value"" comes to mind. Bill Pullman is trying,maybe a little to hard,and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self-conscious and kinda lame.Save yourself from this and watch a double feature of ""In Cold Blood"" and ""The Hitcher"".As somebody said, this would never have been made if Jennifer Lynch was not the overrated David Lynch's daughter."
Wanted             ,brando647,1,action,2008,8,"I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.The quirk with the Fraternity is that it's assassin's have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm, pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speed...basically ""bullet-time"". So you can expect a lot of over-the-top stunts, including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie, I don't know. It's not really over-used and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout, though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley's training with the Fraternity. The film also has a ""twist"" ending, though it isn't difficult to see the truth coming.For a popcorn flick, the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, the overseer of the Fraternity, and it's the first time I've seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film (though I guess it's to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting ""Kill THIS motherf***a"" in a film). Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox, though I'm biased to the point where I'd love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson; I had not seen any of McAvoy's previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek, anxiety-ridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.While I've read quite a few complaints about this film, I can't understand why. It's a guilty-pleasure action film and it's not to meant to be taken completely seriously. It's just a MOVIE and a fun one to boot. When you watch this film, just sit back, disengage your brain, and enjoy the non-stop action and fun characters. 1"
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2             ,maiamire,1,misc,2008,9,"I loved this movie. I am in love with Alexis Bledel's acting, and I think all the Characters were cast WONDERFULLY.~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*SPOILERS AHEAD~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*~_*There was some disappointment for me as far as sticking to plot line. I know they kind of crammed all the other books into one movie, but they could have done a better job of mixing them.For Example: When Bridget gets to Turkey, she never even has interaction with Peter, who basically made up her ENTIRE PLOT for the last book, and her trip to Turkey. Perhaps they thought a younger woman having an affair with an older man was ""too much"" or ""too hard to handle"" for a younger audience, but I felt it was important to the plot, and therefore should have been added.Carmen's story was a bit off as well, but nothing as drastic as Bee's. (The Character who plays Ian was PERFECT) As far as Lena goes, it was nearly spot on, but I felt there was something lacking with the ""breakup"" with Leo. It was almost non-existent, and had I not read the books, I would have been fairly confused with what happened to him.All in all, though, it was a well made movie, I enjoyed it. I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love.On a personal note: I went into the first movie thinking ""I'm going to be like Tibby, ""the rebel."" and went into the second thinking ""I'm going to be like Bridget, ""the lost for love"" type, yet both times left feeling more like Lena. Not really related to the movie, but says something not only for Lena's character, but Alexis Bledel's acting as well.I WOULD recommend this movie to a friend, but not for young girls under 14-15. It deals with some deep emotions, and Pregnancy scares, so it's not really for a ""young"" audience.Overall, a good movie."
Iron Man             ,Chris_Docker,0,action,2008,7,"Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark <U+0096> with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes <U+0096> is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up <U+0096> to explain how he becomes Iron Man <U+0096> is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland <U+0096> this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track <U+0096> or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand! 1"
The Express             ,LDQ409,,misc,2008,10,"The Express was one of the best sports movies I have seen. It tells the story of Ernie Davis, who was the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy and his relationship with his coach, Ben Schwarzwalder.It is set in the late 50's where there was still a great deal of prejudice against African Americans, even in the northern states where segregation was not overt. Ernie's optimism and willingness to be the best football player he can be, not just the best African American football player was portrayed perfectly by Rob Brown. He was inspiring and you couldn't help rooting for him to succeed.Ben was a crusty, set in his ways coach, who couldn't see beyond winning the game. Ernie helped him see that a football team is made up of individuals who have to pull together to achieve their goals. Dennis Quaid is an excellent actor, who can say so much with just a smile or a raised eyebrow. He is so natural, it is as if he isn't acting at all. Dennis & Rob have a very good chemistry, and they made every scene believable.The Express was similar to the Rookie, another great film that Dennis Quaid starred in. Both films had just the right amount of drama, set off with little bits of comedy to relieve the tension.At the showing I attended, the audience was very moved by the film because when it was over, there was much applause, something you don't hear much in movies these days.You don't have to be a football fan to love this movie. I highly recommend it."
Julia             ,LeonardOsborneKael,1,crime,2010,10,"""JULIA"" is a rare example of a movie created IN English by a French director - and Erick Zonca is truly one of the finest directors around these days. He's only made 6 films and all of them have won or been nominated for major awards. Sadly overlooked by American audiences, ""JULIA"" is a beautifully crafted mystery-suspense drama that serves as a wonderful setting for the amazing Tilda Swinton to present one of the most resonant motion picture performances of recent years. It's an in-depth ""lead"" and, at the same time, ""character"" role and her performance is truly unforgettable. As we have come to expect from Mr. Zonca, this is a beautifully crafted yet spontaneous work. It is a living, breathing, thoughtful film experience that will stay with you for a long tim"
Yes Man             ,Argemaluco,0,comedy,2009,6,"During the 90's,the career of the brilliant comedian Jim Carrey was at the top thanks to films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,The Mask,Dumb and Dumber and Liar,Liar.I personally found that films very funny and entertaining and Carrey could make his talent to explode at the maximum level.But,on this decade,his career went pretty unnoticed because Carrey decided to leave aside his frenetic (but excellent) performances on the comedies I mentioned,for making more serious stuff.Although I liked his performances on movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Majestic very much,very few people remember him on that movies.Also,his comedies Bruce Almighty and Fun With Dick and Jane,showed him more serious and controlled than in his movies from the 90's.The fact is that,as well as his performances on dramas,very few people remember him on that movies.Maybe,noticing that,Carrey decided to come back to his kind of frenetic roles from the 90's,to come back to the top.The result is Yes Man.Although this movie kept me moderately entertained,it is very far away from the comedies Carrey participated on the 90's.But,on its own merit,this movie results to be a mediocre comedy.Although I laughed on some occasions,there are various jokes which fail,because they result pretty obvious and basic.Plus,the screenplay has a lot of forced elements which do not result credible at all.And,as I mentioned,this movie is generic and mediocre.But,there are some positive elements which make Yes Man worthy of a slight recommendation.Although he has much more talent than the one he shows in this movie,Carrey brings a competent performance,and his character empathizes with the spectator.Zooey Deschannel brings a correct performance,although she does not have too much to do.And,in spite of all the fails,this movie kept me moderately entertained.That and Carrey's and Deschannel's development make me recommend softly Yes Man.Although I did not dislike it,the experience was forgettable and mediocre in my case.I think this phrase summarizes the experience I had with this movie : I do not regret watching it,but it would have not bothered me to skip it."
Mamma Mia!             ,elisebm,1,comedy,2008,10,"After watching the Mamma Mia! musical in London, I was thrilled to hear about the movie coming out. Meryl Streep in a musical seemed like just one reason to watch it. Well, I must say.. It was a lot more than what I expected! The beautiful scenery, the cast and the songs. A good mix of tears, laughter and love that will make you feel like you're a part of the gang and enjoy every bit of this movie. Not one of the cast members let me down. It really is a feel-good movie and it made me want to stand up and sing a long. The ABBA songs are made for dancing and in this movie it reassured me. The singing and the dancing put smiles on people's faces, and it makes you feel happy and as if all worries are gone. I certainly smiled during the entire movie. The cast members were all wonderful singers and especially the two lead actresses Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried impressed me. A well-made movie that is worth watching more than once! 1"
Surveillance             ,stratfranks,1,crime,2010,1,"How on earth does this sort of rubbish get made? Jennifer Lynch rips off her dad David's style without any substance whatsoever, and the appallingly stupid plot (that itself is a rip-off of Natural Born Killers) makes you feel sorry for the actors. Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond have clearly fallen on very hard times if this is the sort of junk they're reduced to working in - not that their performances are any better than the script, which is written like a bad student film, though on this evidence it's doubtful that David Lynch's talentless daughter would actually get accepted into any self-respecting film school. Let's hope the negative gets lost by the lab."
Ghost Town             ,cultfilmfan,0,misc,2008,9,"Ghost Town is a new film that sounds like it either is a western, or a horror film, but it is actually neither. Instead it is a romantic comedy that has ghosts in it. The story revolves around a socially awkward and obnoxious dentist named Bertram Pincus, who after a medical procedure can see ghosts and one in particular named Frank, who tries to set Bertram up with his now single wife named Gwen. Frank coaches Bertram along, but ultimately to get Gwen to fall for him, Bertram, will have to shed his icy image and become more of a caring and helpful person. Ghost Town opened to really good reviews pretty much all around, but unfortunately it is doing really poorly at the box office. I think this is a romantic comedy that will appeal to a really large number of people because it is a feel good film, has some really good comic moments and because of the good performances, especially by Ricky Gervais who plays Bertram. The premise of the film is almost like The Sixth Sense meets Cyrano de Bergerac, but at the same time it also does have a lot of originality and some neat plot twists and turns. A lot of the comedies that have come out this year and that have been successful were more or less cruder more adult fare comedies, and while I enjoyed a lot of them personally, I realized that they would definitely not be for everyone. Ghost Town on the other hand will work for both crowds because it is still very entertaining and funny, but not overly crass, crude or risky enough to prevent more conservative viewers, or even kids from seeing it. I think a lot of people will like the romantic part of the film and I think a lot of people will also enjoy Ricky Gervais as Bertram and just how un likable he is and how funny he is to watch. The subplot with the ghosts is also a neat twist to the film that adds a lot of laughs and originality to the film as well. This is one of the best feel good comedies of the year, that like I said, will appeal to many different people and I think once it is rediscovered on DVD that it will become a sleeper hit because of how good it is and I can really seeing this being a crowd favourite and for obvious reasons because of the great performances and the feel good yet funny script. This is definitely one to see if it is still playing in theatres near you, or rent it in five months when it hits video shelves."
The Brothers Bloom             ,rgcustomer,1,action,2010,6,"This film is a self-indulgent bore. I'm not sure what it wants to be, beyond that. Is it a comedy? But then it would need to have at least one laugh in it somewhere. There seemed to be things which were supposed to be funny to the writer, but just weren't to the audience. Is it a crime drama? But then it would need to be remotely believable. Surely someone writing a movie about con artistry would acknowledge that much. But I didn't buy any of it. Is it a mystery? But then it wouldn't be so predictable. Is it a thoughtful meditation on some theme? Maybe. But I just couldn't get interested in it. It's too cutesy and ""oh look at me"" for that.On top of it, the leads are two of the most annoying ""actors"" in Hollywood today. One of these two per film is one thing, but both of them? I couldn't get into the characters, because I kept seeing Mark and Adrian, Mark and Adrian. Ugh.Anyway, 6/10 because I didn't feel totally insulted. Brick was insulting. This one I feel was a genuine attempt at making a film, that just failed miserably. Dare I hope for better with the next one"
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa             ,ramchandar_gl,0,animation,2008,9,"I am not a big fan of cartoons but a friend forced me to watch this. I use IMDb as a true barometer to judge films and so was a little disappointed to see a below average rating for Madagascar 2. I will give it a 9/10. It had everything that a cartoon movie could ask for - animals with crazy human-looking faces, hilarious dialogues, simple story and finally some extra ordinary animation. The story is simple enough for every age group to be involved. I was particularly impressed with the reasoning behind the water problem in the jungle.Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer's voices deserve special mention.I haven't seen Madagascar 1 but my friend told me that this is a worthy and better sequel.

Milk             ,gatraylor,0,misc,2008,9,"I saw this last night at the Portland premiere with Gus Van Sant and James Franco among others. This is a powerful work and, in my opinion, Gus Van Sant has taken a big step towards the mainstream in his artistic direction. To me, the person who is by no means a movie expert, it seems that this movie had a much faster, accessible pace than his other movies. There were no long-shots or minutes at a time without dialog, etc.I've really never thought much of Sean Penn before, but, with this role, I expect him to sweep up the awards. Everyone was great in their parts, but he did such an excellent job in portraying the Harvey Milk that I have seen before in clips and documentaries. They did not make out Milk to be a choir-boy, which was one thing I was afraid was going to happen. This story seems long overdue in it's telling, but so completely relevant to today's news.I expect, as the movie hits theaters, this will cause quite a stir, with both sides using it as fodder in their fight. I expect the ratings will reflect this as there are already people giving it 0's who obviously did not attend the premiere. I don't think it deserves a 10 either, but is much, much closer to that end. Looked at objectively, it is a sometimes tearful, sometimes funny movie that was put together masterfully "
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,rpchristie-812-957946,0,adventure,2014,10,"Intriguing, often very suspenseful and mysterious, the story keeps us wondering and waiting for answers all the way through. The themes are loneliness and rejection/ fear of rejection. Although I missed the significance of the foreshadowing right in the beginning when the main character showed grace and civility towards both his guards and fellow inmates as he was released from prison, in retrospect it was a well written screenplay. The acting by all characters was excellent.It was believable because of the extremely good character portrayal, the realistic settings in post-Katrina New Orleans area and cinematography that didn't try to sugar coat anything. I'd never seen it before (2014) but it is now on my top ten list. For once I could watch a movie without thinking ""I'm going to have to shut this off"". The story has a lot of power to make one think deeply and in the end we're left with resolutions but also with room to imagine our own continuation. Thank-you to it's creators, especially the cas"
Frost/Nixon             ,Vondaz,0,misc,2011,5,"I had never seen the real interview between Frost and Nixon and so came into this movie totally fresh. The story is engaging, the script enjoyable and the acting fine. At the end though, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a ""he said it!!"" moment.The film implied that Frost had gotten Nixon to admit to something no-one else could (i.e. something illegal), thereby condemning himself to political wilderness. However, instead I was left feeling that Nixon was an OK guy - an intelligent, quick witted, sincere and strong guy who did what it took to get things done. Whereas Frost came across as a chancer, who was a bit lucky. At the end I wondered what the purpose of the movie was.I have now seen the actual footage of the interviews and can only conclude that the movie's purpose was to show Nixon in a much more favourable light than he would've come across in the real interviews - because in the real interviews, he stinks. In the real interviews you can see the panic in his face, you can see the often painfully contrived shows of friendliness in his mannerisms and you can hear the uncoordinated logic of his answers. Whereas in the movie he's smooth with his answers and his mannerisms.Any Brits out there should liken Nixon to our very own Gordon Brown - a man as bereft of any social attractiveness as Nixon. By getting Langella to play Nixon, it's like getting Alec Guiness to play Brown. I.e. a brilliant actor, but a million miles away from the truth.And THAT'S the problem with these recent ""real life"" movies that focus on people in high offices of state - The Queen, The Special Relationship and now Frost/Nixon. The films make the people in high office appear to be totally articulate, very quick witted, sincere, at times funny and always strong in character and determination. Whereas the truth is anything but that. We've seen footage of a supposedly eloquent Clinton and he is anything but. We've seen the Queen deliver her speeches and ""sincerity"" is never a word you'd associate with her.I know the counter argument is that it is only a movie and we shouldn't take it literally. But that's just it, by giving the film ""real"" characters and ""real story"" lines, the film makers are implying it is real. In fact, it is the very suggestion that it might be factual that draws the audiences in. Otherwise where would the attraction be of seeing a film about a fictional President's relationship with a fictional Prime Minster? Or a fictional queen's reaction to the death of a fictional daughter in law? There would be no attraction. So the makers have lured us paying public to part with our hard earned cash to see something that promises fact but instead delivers fiction.So yes, I enjoyed the ""story"", but ended up resenting its total fiction."
Space Chimps             ,stevex-8,,animation,2009,8,"Some pretty harsh comments about this movie and I don't know why. As an adult I found it funny and Titan was cast perfectly.There was even a good message or two and some well camouflaged adult type humor in there. We liked it and we would buy it. One or two things in the show almost raised a red flag (ie: scary cave monster), but it wasn't that bad. I say enjoy!Some of my favorite parts were with the rocket-scientists though and a little more investigation into the cast reveals some interesting characters. I gave this an 8 out of 10 and maybe I was feeling a little generous but it made me laugh."
W.             ,Fargoisgreatmovie,0,misc,2008,8,"Enter the theatre with the wrong expectations and you will be disappointed. I was excited to see the movie because I thought it would be a chronicle of George W Bush's presidency (2001-2008) as well as a biography of his life before assuming office. Unfortunately, the movie does not extend past 2003 and most of the screen time is given to his earlier life and his love/hate relationship with his father. Easily the most interesting scenes in the movie are the ones with him and his Cabinet. One significant flaw in the movie is the casting, particularly the ones for Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and George Bush Sr., who either do not have the proper voice (the former two) or bear any physical resemblance (the latter). Josh Brolin's performance in this movie is one of the best things about this movie and he should deserve an Oscar nod as he should have gotten for his outstanding performance in the Coen Brother's masterpiece No Country For Old Men. This movie could have been better had Stone waited for the real Bush to complete his presidency and then painted a complete portrait of his Presidency instead of just the first 3 years and if he had changed some of the cast around. The father-son relationship is interesting but becomes redundant. The writing, acting and craftsmanship are impressive, however. 8 out of 10."
The House Bunny             ,gimpo,1,comedy,2010,7,"Brains do not need to be engaged for this movie. But it does produce a few wonderful - and hilarious - surprises that make it a very enjoyable 90 minutes.One is Anna Farris, who does a great twist on the archetypal dizzy blonde beloved of Hollywood since time immemorial.But the real kickers are the jarring one-liners that pepper an otherwise sweet and predictable film. Several reduced this viewer to paroxysms of laughter, tears rolling down cheeks, beverage spurting across the room.These moments, when they arrive, are so unexpected that the effect is one of firmly-flicked kipper on unprotected jowl. And none are in the ""gross-out"" style that one might have expected in a film of this genre.Very bunny indeed."
Julia             ,PipAndSqueak,1,crime,2008,4,"I hated this film. There are many things wrong - all to do with poor establishment of point of view. Who the viewer is supposed to follow I really don't know. Tilda's character is well portrayed but that does not make up for an impossible plot. Where does a penniless alcoholic get ready cash from at the drop of a hat? How do you drive a car for hundreds of miles without getting petrol? If you're an addict of some kind, well, I supposed you might get something from this miserable, less than entertaining film. If not, don't bother. You'll just be made very unhappy and you won't learn anything. Mexico comes out very badly - yes, OK there is a problem with crime but for God's sake we don't need to see this sort of thing. It feels like a con, the characters are all conners and quite frankly you'd be wasting money going to see it."
The Bank Job             ,WriterDave,0,crime,2008,7,"Sold to the American public as another D-level action pic staring Jason Statham, ""The Bank Job"" is actually a crafty British heist flick based on an incredible true story. The screenwriters deserve credit for creating a serviceable script with so many intertwining stories based on little actual evidence, conjecture, here-say, and conspiracy theories revolving around royal and political sex scandals, militant Caribbean drug lords, undercover MI5 agents, bumbling crooks, crooked cops, and double-crosses and cover-ups. It could've easily been a confusing mess, but providing the viewer pays attention, ""The Bank Job"" gets the job done as crackerjack entertainment.Though aptly directed by veteran Roger Donaldson, the film does suffer from an overly salacious opening ten minutes designed to grab the audience's attention, some shoddy editing, and an intrusively bad action-style music score. There's also an attention to 1970's period detail in the dialogue and clothes that comes across as caricature and adds an accidentally humorous undertone to the otherwise cold-as-ice affair. However, the details of the ""truth is stranger than fiction"" tale and the fun had by the ensemble cast make for a breezy way to spend a few hours.Donaldson also has an eye for the ladies. Led by a smashingly gorgeous Saffron Burrows (looking like a European version of Michelle Pfeiffer circa 1992), the powerful women depicted in ""The Bank Job"" are far more than just eye candy. Statham is also fairly good as the head of the bank robbing crew, and when he finally throws a brick at a guy near the end of the film, it will put a smile on any action fan's face.Things get tidied up a bit too nicely in the end, where it seems only the really villainous characters have to face justice, but before the credits role, there are a series of real-life epilogued details plastered on the screen that make the viewer realize maybe this all really did happen. Now that's a jolly good show. 1"
The Yellow Handkerchief             ,druid333-2,0,adventure,2010,9,"What starts out as what appears as just another road movie turns out to be three tales of inter generational angst. Brett Hanson is an ex convict that is on a mission to find his lost love. Martine is a 15 year old girl who is just discovering life,and Gordo is a 16 year old boy,who is kind of geeky,gawky & awkward around girls,but wants a girl friend in the worst way. When their lives intersect at a rest stop,the three hit the road,looking for their own adventures. Along the way, truths are revealed,tears are shed & (potential)friend ships are forged. William Hurt ('Kiss Of The Spider Woman','The Big Chill',and most recently,'End Game')is Brett,a man who tries to get by with few words as necessary,who carries a dark secret & has a mission in life. Maria Bello is his ex wife,May. Kristin Stewart (previously seen in 'Twilight',and 'New Moon',and soon to be seen as Joan Jett in 'The Runaways')is Martine,a girl who is looking for something better in life than what she's being offered,presently. Eddie Redmayne is Gordo, who first comes off as something of a jerk at first,but matures a little, (for his own good). India's own Udayan Prasad directs from a screenplay written by Erin Dignam,from a story by Pete Hamill. This is a slow moving film that has to work it's way into your system,but is worth the test of patients in the end. Rated PG-13 by the MPAA,this film contains brief sexual content,some rough language & brief outbursts of violence (but nothing bloody or gory)"
Twilight             ,t7v7s,1,misc,2009,1,"I saw this for free at the Recreational Center on my college campus, and it became the first movie I ever walked out of. As a horror movie fan and a film director, I have never felt so insulted in my life. Since when can vampires survive in daylight. I loved the line ""You avoid daylight"".... PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE FILM TOOK PLACE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!!!! Apparently now they just glow and show their ""true form"" Really? What's next, werewolves will start drinking liquid silver for breakfast? Frankenstein becomes a fire twirler? Might as well, the rules of movie monsters apparently do not apply anymore. When the main vampire (I didn't care enough to catch his name) said ""We consider ourselves vegetarians"", that was all I could take. Everyone involved with this film should have stakes shoved through their hearts for conspiring to create this garbage. Anybody who likes vampires should agree with me. If you don't, you are a poser my friend. That is the cold, hard truth. 2"
Trucker             ,ClaytonDavis,1,drama,2009,NA,"I had the esteemed pleasure of attending the New York Premiere of first-time director James Mottern's film Trucker starring Michelle Monaghan. To make even more pleasurable was sitting next to James' father and having him tell me how he paid for his ticket to support his son. I share this for a realization of what James' family conveyed and how closely related it is to his film; a working class family never forgetting where they came from. Trucker tells the story of Diane Ford (Monaghan), a young female, independent truck driver living life effortlessly and freely. All seems going to plan or lack there of until her estranged son (Jimmy Bennett) is dropped off on her doorstep due to his father's recent diagnosis of cancer. It is this time where we find Diane's world is turned upside down. Responsibility and the maternal instinct, two important things that have laid dormant in Diane's mind for sometime are swiftly reactivated. Along with this new found purpose, all the other elements that have inhabited her life for ten years are rattled; her awkward relationship with her friend Runner (Nathan Fillion), her ailing ex Leonard (Benjamin Bratt), and his new love in his life Jenny (Joey Lauren Adams).What Mottern succeeds in his narrative his a brave and sensible character study of a woman who has withdrew herself from ""real"" human emotion. Not as profound as Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler from 2008, but perhaps a simpler tale, one that doesn't require too much of the viewer. For a good chunk of the picture the young Jimmy Bennett does some marvelous work, perhaps the best child performance of the year thus far. Unfortunately Mottern's writing of the young Peter is often stale and unnatural, giving him far too much credit for an eleven year old boy. Though I can admire the work considerably, what I loved about it, I ultimately turned on somewhere within the 90 minute running time. Michelle Monaghan on the other hand gives her most personal and powerful performance of her career. Her dedication to Diane is some of the finest work displayed on screen this year and is surely to be in serious consideration for an Oscar nomination. Monaghan devotes her mind and heart into one of the most unlikable characters and demands our respect and attention, something not easily attained by an actor. Her screen chemistry with Jimmy Bennett is some of the most natural and beautiful scenes seen in quite sometime, despite it being filled anger and acrimony. Despite Monaghan being the best chances of the film to garner awards consideration this season, the unsung hero is Nathan Fillion who gives the most tender and heart warming supporting turn of the year thus far. As I'm sure I might be in the minority for the praise of this actor, I feel inclined to give a superb performance its proper due. I admire it greatly.Other strong aspects of the picture lie in the cinematography of Lawrence Sher is should find himself with an Independent Spirit Award mention this year as well. The film is definitely worth a watch and as it may not fit well with everyone, you have to admire the attempt nonetheless. Michelle Monaghan and Nathan Fillion give some of the best works of the year and it's always great to see the birth of a writer/director like James Mottern and where he could go in his career. Trucker is definitely worth the watch.***/****"
Igor             ,cbankston-1,0,animation,2008,10,"This was a great animated film. A little twisted fun! The actors were great and the music was such a nice surprise! Clever, clever, clever. Steve Buscemi as a suicidal rabbit and Sean Hayes as a STUPID brain play so well off one another! Jennifer Coolidge is one of my favorites and she doesn't disappoint. She plays two characters and is great. Arsenio Hall was really funny. Welcome back Arsenio! I haven't been familiar with Eddie Izzard's work, but he does such a wonderful job on this film. I would definitely watch the age of the child you bring. Eight and older seems appropriate. This movie is a good mix of dark and light. Adults and children can appreciate this movie."
Saw V             ,waseem-khan,0,crime,2008,1,"Where do I start, this was a total pointless piece of Film making, and the franchise now is living of the name, which is slowly deteriorating. There is nothing fresh or exciting left about Saw any more. There are 2 Games in Saw V, the first game with the 5 Participants while at first appears to be the Usual, Play by the Rules and Survive, or Play as you wish and Die, turned out to be nothing more than a plot allow the FBI to think that Agent Strahm is Jigsaw, which in my view is not a worthy game for Jigsaw, his mission should be above such shallowness. The entrapment was tried in the first movie, when they planted the Doctors flashlight on one of his victims. The 2nd Game, is a Re-Hash of the game with Mark Whalberg from Saw 2, with the almost the same Rules,Stay in the Room and Live, or Follow your instincts & The building will become your Tomb.Were there any good bits in the movie, well yes, there were some nice touches, Agent Strahm giving himself a Tracheotomy, & Hoffmans Revenge on his Sisters killer was a very nice touch, and, oh, no thats about it, these touches while good, are not enough to hold a whole movie together.The Tag Line You won't believe how it ends, is a total let down, the ending was the same as Saw IV, and we already knew who took over from John as Jigsaw. You won't believe how it ends, more like, We could not think of a proper Ending so we re-used Saw IV ending. Poor Poor Poor.Also and Unfortunately in my view, one question was never answered and has left a unfortunate reason for Saw VI to be made, Whats in the Box thats Johns wife was given? In short, Saw V is like the Labour Government, It's running out of Ideas - This is a truly awful movie, and like Jigsaw, should be stopped. I pray I have the will power to leave Saw VI well alone, but I'm stupid like that and I just know I will talk the wife into going to see i"
Surveillance             ,okieindian,1,crime,2009,1,"I do not know what today's movie goers expect, but after 68 years of movie watching.. (Well maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make that 58 years of movie watching) I expect to be entertained, not bored to tears, assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. Surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have NO imagination, little if any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose for it has elapsed. That anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie, when it is nothing more that Hollywood garbage is beyond me. As a combat veteran I have seen violence, blood and gore, in many forms, and movies like We were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get, but it has redeeming value. Surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor, with no writing ability, no directorial training, no experience in film editing, and a total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents, setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops, etc.. A high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like..."
Frost/Nixon             ,grindhouse_fan,0,misc,2008,10,"400 Million People Were Waiting For the Truth.Plot: A dramatic retelling of the post-Watergate television interviews between British talk-show host David Frost and former president Richard Nixon.Frost/Nixon, directed by Ron Howard and with a gripping screenplay by Peter Morgan, and the film is based on his play, is a stunning and extremely sharp vision of the summer of 1977. All the cast was really scored-up. But, specially, Langella and Sheen were superb. It contains a really carefully-and-well-crafted realistic 70's scenario. Both, editing and photography were great. One of the could-be contenders of 2009 Academy Awards. The reason is that, this ""stylistic game"" very carefully made with a very solid structure, with its amazing photography, excellent artwork, brilliant screenplay, superb performances, very good music and a fantastic direction by Ron Howard, and, let me say that this is one of the most exigent movies that he's ever done, it'll get more that one Academy Award nomination. It's one of those bare movies that after seeing it, it leaves you shaking, ice-cold and that you cannot get it out of your head. Verdict: In the style of Oliver Stone's classic ""JFK"", Howard accomplishes a true work of art. With a little bit of luck, this'll get into the Top 250. A film that advantageously accomplishes, with an extremely visionary ""politic"" argument, arriving to the land of its narrative searches. A film with an impeccable production and impeccable performances. A movie that talks to us about how we respond to truth and lie. Perfect. A film that will transcend through time. A brilliant pick for the season. A Great Movie."
Flash of Genius             ,Greatornot,0,misc,2008,9,"This movie was the proverbial big bad corporation taking advantage of a little guys talents. Excellently acted by all. I especially enjoyed the supporting acting in this film as much as the headliner actors. Alan Alda had a minor role as an attorney but he was excellent. This movie was about an idealistic guy that cared more about his place in history than anything else in the world. His ideals may or may not be misplaced. He seemed to care more about what is right but neglecting his family in the process. He was obsessed with an invention that was stolen from him by Ford originally and other manufacturers shortly after. I liked Greg Kinnear in this role and thought he was his finest. Truth be told , none of us know how we would feel, what our price would be if someone stole any one of our ideas. I , for one, would not judge Robert Kearns. As the years dragged on he seemed to show more appreciation toward his family , perhaps realizing they are worth more than anything. Thus, still pursuing his dream of going down in history as the inventor of Intermittent Windshield Wipers. All in all , the movie was a great experience and one I highly recommend. I know Intermittent Wipers are about as sexy as say an ice tray... but give the movie a try. It is highly informative and entertainin"
Untraceable             ,spacejoc,1,crime,2008,5,"I'd been looking forward to seeing Untraceable. Its viral marketing was mildly intriguing, whereby accessing the killer's website led to a series of flash puzzles ultimately leading to the film's trailer. The premise, using the Internet as a murder weapon, also held some promise. Unfortunately, these concepts are squandered on a third rate script.The Pros:Diane Lane. The concept itself, while reminiscent of SAW, with a technological twist.The Cons:The identity of the killer is revealed 40 min into the film. Shameless, absolutely unnecessary plug for the Onstar System 10 minutes into the film. The ending was somewhat rushed, and as such felt anti-climactic. The killer's motivation is simple revenge.All in all, Untraceable isn't too bad - but it definitely leaves you with disappointed expectation"
Surveillance             ,doctriveni,1,crime,2010,1,"This must be the worst thriller I have seen in a long long time. The directing, the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery. I guessed this within the first few minutes and I kept hoping I was wrong and much to my dismay I was not.The film starts off with two FBI agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a cop. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day. Each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better.Spoiler: The whole story ends in the FBI agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them.Why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents (when you discover that real FBI agents had been killed and their badges were found on them)? How did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras?Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end. Maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not sinister in the least. The character of the young girl is also wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal. She does not appear distressed, but rather detached which again is not explained. Awful film on the whole."
Adoration             ,carl-obrien25,0,drama,2009,3,"I'm going to resist the temptation of asking the obvious question: If Egoyan's wife can't act, why does he put her in all of his films?Let's get back to the movie. The film is sterile and devoid of any meaningful human reference. Like most of Egoyan's films it dallies in identity and political issues but never achieves what it absolutely must: an ironic detachment from politics. Egoyan shies away from unpolitical folk and their relationships. He can't understand that people's identities are formed inside their bowels. Related to this is that he has no ear for people's voices and never gives us the words they use. So all we get is fragments of philosophized thought and process that has meaning only to Egoyan.To compensate for not knowing a human speaker from a college textbook, Egoyan writes gaudy, overblown, and contrived plots which he populates with trendy but stock characters, whose past isn't personal, it's ceremonial.The hero is a young Canadian daubed in both Christian and Muslim colors; this makes him colorful, but it does not make him real, compelling, grounded, believable, interesting, or worth spending 90 minutes with. Background? Both his parents were killed in a car accident when he was young but no one knows why or how.This heritage of the lad is a college test on The Virtues and Problematics of Diversity. But Diversity is a bureaucratic goal, not a human condition, state of mind, or even attitude. Then, there's the rest of it: Simon is being raised by his uncle who ""may or may not"" be a racist. Simon's grandfather is a racist and the Islamicity of Simon's father makes grandfather suspect foul play in the death of Simon's mother. All fascinating, but in real movies, this would be a pretext and a filter over the true plot, involving life. Unhappily, life is a bilogical compound, not a conceit. There is no air and no life in Egoyan's films, just an auteur's recycled mood."
"Surfer, Dude             ",stevecauley,0,comedy,2008,3,"What can you say about a movie that features Matthew McConaughey playing a surfer/stoner, with Woody Harrelson as his sidekick, that's barely able to muster a single laugh in 90 minutes? About all you can say is that someone dropped the ball and that someone would have to be first time feature filmmaker S.R. Bindler. Instead of clever dialogue and an engaging plot, we are treated to lots of ""stoner lingo,"" tight shots of girls' asses, and plenty of topless scenes thrown in for good measure. In other words, the sort of movie a 17-year-old kid would make with his camcorder and a couple of buddies. Remember those Burt Reynolds movies in the 70's that basically had no plot but gave Burt an excuse to make a film with his pals? This is Matthew McConaughey's homage to those. We're even treated to a cameo by Willie Nelson in a role that serves no purpose other than as an excuse to have him in the movie. On a positive note, ""Surfer, Dude"" makes ""Sahara"" look like Oscar material."

Written and directed by David Koepp, the man who wrote ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" with Martin Donovan, a personal hero of mine. Not to mention some of the biggest moneymakers of the last two decades. ""Ghost Town"" strives for something else, it pinpoints the goodness hidden in the heart of someone who, perhaps, never knew was there. A comedy of personal discovery no less. I was moved and delighted. Ricky Gervais goes through it, stumbling over himself with an innocence that is as real as it is mysterious. I connected with him half way through and it took me by surprise. I was loving a character that at the beginning I thought was funny but despicable. That for me means I've learned something.

Pride and Glory             ,shadowman123,,crime,2008,8,"Pride and Glory is a very well constructed urban gritty police drama which is different from other various cop movies. On the surface it might just seem like a superficial police drama, but scratch the misleading trailers and underneath you have a tough cop drama dealing with the moral themes in a complex melting pot. I could not think of someone who handles complex characters better than Ed Norton and his ability to do that with what might seem like no effort is magical, Colin Farrell on the other hand was equally entertaining with his out look as a police officer. The action is nothing over the top and deals with certain issues with a very in your face way of getting its point across. Although it might be a little too long and drag on in places it however does keep you watching it due to the performances. To some it up , Pride and Glory is drama that one has to be in the mood to watch although there is heavy script and acting involved it requires a clear and rigid mind to view.PRIDE AND GLORY : 8.3 OUT OF 10"
The Lucky Ones             ,the-movie-guy,,adventure,2008,8,"(Synopsis) After recovering from their wounds in the Iraq War, three soldiers are sent back to the United States. Sgt. T.K. Poole (Michael Pena) and Pvt. Colee Dunn (Rachel McAdams) are given a 30-day leave, and Sgt. Fred Cheever (Tim Robbins) is retiring. The three soldiers now have a new mission. T.K is going home to visit his fiancée, Colee is going to return a guitar to the family of the man who saved her life, and Fred is going home to his wife in St. Louis. When they arrive at JFK Airport in New York, all fights have been canceled, because of a blackout. The three decide to rent a van and drive to St. Louis, and once there, T.K. and Colee can catch a plane to Las Vegas. What started out to be a short 14 hour trip ends up being a journey across America. Along the way, the three soldiers who had just met at JFK, become close friends.(My Comment) This is a human interest story that explores the interpersonal aspects that war has on our soldiers, especially the ones who are injured as they return home. We learn the pitfalls of returning to this country where our soldiers are only given a token ""Thank You"" platitude from the public. We also see how three soldiers band together, and become in a sense a family taking care of one another. The film gives enough time in the character development of each soldier that we begin to like each soldier, and you wouldn't mind making them your friends. Their cross-county road trip is full of foolish misadventures that are memorable. For the most part, the film is serious to a point, yet it is also a comedy. I believe this small film will be one of those sleeper movies that the public will like, and it could be a hit. (QED International, Run Time 1:55, Rated R) (8/10)"

The plot line is very simple and the movie is very predictable with loads of clichés.Anna Faris' performance is the only thing that can save this movie. She's funny and can really get into a character, even though this role seemed like her roles on the Scary Movie series, playing a dumb and shallow girl.

Flash of Genius             ,two-cents,0,misc,2008,8,"A beautiful story of honor, ethics, hard work and the American Dream. I believe the true story was a bit more complex; read somewhere that Kerns had at one time 12 lawsuits going simultaneously and several law firms on them. And I think his mental health problems were sanitized in the film. Nevertheless, the thread of maintaining integrity comes through in this film. And as far as being a true story, I wonder what role his victory has had for victories we occasionally read about today. (probably too few that end in victory but at least some do make it). Kerns certainly gave hope to many, and it seemed like the American justice system worked back then.The film is interesting. It lacks the usual Hollywood melodrama--which I was glad some plot twists that I thought were so predictable did NOT turn out to happen, and it lacks the pace of fast action, special effects and sex. All of which contribute to a quieter, more thoughtful, and ultimately more touching film. It stayed with me throughout the next day.I highly recommend it, for reasons of believing in what we were and what we can become again....mayb"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button             ,tw1zzlers,0,drama,2008,1,"Groucho Marx said there's no worse thief than a bad movie. (steals your money and your time) and that's exactly what this film is.Do not, I repeat, do not tolerate the comparisons to Forrest Gump - a film filled with history, humor!, star-studded cast, a solid script, jam packed with history, one clever gimmick after the other and brilliant effects.Spoiler - Benjamin Button had one effect, that was make-up: Take one of the world's most attractive men and make him look unattractive for 75% of the film, while he moans and groans about the deal he's been dealt in life. don't get me wrong, they did this well, but he's never sympathetic. Y'just don't care about him at all... to be honest, the whole film struck me as a giant, drawn-out metaphor for a midlife crisis: a man pines after a girl who's not ready for him for years and years, then when she finally takes him into her bed, they spend a glorious year between the sheets, and as soon as responsibility shows up in the form of a child, he runs away from commitment, blaming his condition. And what's the big deal with his condition??? So his body is getting younger.. not his mind. That would actually make him a great father... he'd be around for the same number of years as many fathers are for their children.. 30/40 years, and during that time he'd only have gotten stronger and younger, while his mind was still maturing. What a gift! Great, cherish it! Live it! Accept your lot in life, challenges and all, and be a remarkable human being. That's the challenge laid upon us all. But no - Instead of facing his problem and taking on life and love and cherishing every moment, he lets down the woman he loves terribly and runs out on her, for what? to have sex with a few women? Preposterous.And then of course, when he comes back, she forgives him for being a coward and a stinker. Well why? Why be so forgiving. What's so tough about his life, oh poor guy, he gets to get younger everyday, he gets to get stronger and better looking as he sleeps.. where was the appreciation of this miracle? Where were the papers who would have been making a big deal over him? Where was the major history that he lived through which we never saw? Where were his amazing slew of life experiences, we watched 90 years of a man's life and all he did was run and hide from who he was. Where was a p-l-o-t? - the guy had no appreciation for the people who loved him, never knew his mother was sick? Nope, just came home one day to find she'd died. Did he not stay in touch with anyone? He did have a sister. I guess she didn't want to call to let him know their mother was ill? Clearly no one cared enough about him to tell him. Classic. Well if they don't, I don't either. And why did Cate's character keep his postcards from their daughter once the journal was found? Made no sense. Cate moved into the house and lived with him for 5 years as he went through Alzheimer's as an infant - where was Julia's character during this time? Also not speaking to anyone? Was she not curious why her mother chose to spend 5 years of her life this way? Why did she never tell her about her father? Why did I watch this piece of drivel and waste my time??? Save yourself the agony.I'm sorry F. Scott Fitzgerald. I'm sure you wrote a lovely short story. But that's all it was, a short story, and should have remained so. Before someone drags out your piece to a 3 hour sedative they ought to maybe actually write a s-t-o-r-y to justify the running time.**Watch the trailer**. That's all you need. And really, do watch it. It's interesting, it's pretty to look at, and really that's the entire story right there, a minute-and-a-half, you can see all of the make-up and special effects, you can pretend you've seen the film, cause nothing more happens - save yourself 3 hours and go spend time with your family instead, appreciate the gift of life instead of squandering it on bad films, or watch a different movie, (ooh, Juno, that was a good flick with an actual script - about dealing with life, hardships and all without boring people to tears), or go bang your head against a wall, something remotely entertaining. Brad, Cate, Julia, you're wonderful, all of you, the whole cast, you're lovely, you got pummeled by a lousy non-script and mind-blowingly uninspired direction. I'm sorry for you all. 2"
Gran Torino             ,CinemaAddict,0,drama,2008,10,"As Clint Eastwood reaches the end of his life, he presents us with yet another performance which is nothing short of legendary. Wishing to preserve the element of surprise, I will not reveal anything by trying to analyse this great work of art. I will say this. There are similar qualities to his previous work, but I would say that both his directing and acting have reached a level of maturity comparable to that of an excellent wine. The story was compelling and, mixed with the drama was a refined touch of humour; the perfect combination for a pleasant evening. I would like to finish by thanking Mr. Eastwood for sharing this touching moment with his audience at a time when most of the cinematic ""art"" produced in Hollywood consists of stunts and bad jokes. 7"
WALL·E             ,Valeen_the_II,0,animation,2008,10,"This truly is one beautiful, touching animated sci-fi film....I cannot stress this enough. It's a unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand.The tale is set in the 22th century , Earth has become a lifeless wasteland full of garbage, that the human race evacuated nearly a millennium ago....Lifeless, that is with the two exceptions being the ""artifical"" life form ""WALL-E"" & his pet cockroach.WALL-E is a squat humble trash-compacting robot who while continuing to fulfill the duties he was programmed for ( even though it's pointless considering there are no more humans on the planet ) collects certain leftover nicknacks, novelty items and even old films that he can still play. He mentally stimulates himself and enjoys fragments of the culture that is now gone ( that of the human race ). Though, WALL-E has imprinted on his little cockroach & vice versa, the little robot longs for more companionship.He receives it in the form of a beautiful, sleek, defensive ""fembot fatale"" ""EVE ""....In their own little forms of robotic communication ( repeating each other's names in various connotations depending on moods ; ""WAAAALLL-E,"" ""EEEEEEEE-VAH!"" ) and WALL-E's Chaplin-esquire clumsiness that amuses EVE, the pair imprint on each other and enjoy each other's company.Sadly, EVE has located a small plant and must return it to her mother ship and leave WALL-E forever...But WALLL-E hops aboard the ship in pursuit of his darling ""EEEEEE-VAH"".And yes this film has very little dialog, but guess what, IT DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' DIALIOUGUE!....The brilliance and beauty of the film is in the interactions and responses of the little robots : a great representation of what ""artificial intelligence"" really is and what it may actually be one day! And how ironic it is that in this film the organic HUMAN RACE has become soulless, mirthless, artless, jaded, self-centered cogs in a machine of blind consumerism, yet the mechanical artificial beings still respond to their surroundings like a toddler or pet : with curiosity, wonder, and delight in communication & learning.And yes there is plenty of comic relief ( albeit sans dialouge ) so no this movie is NOT BORING....It's beautiful, it even made me a little bit misty-eyed.So yeah if you're an a fan of animated films, sci-fi films, and romance you should definitely check out this movie.Obviously, it is going to win a very well-deserved Oscar for ""Best Animated Film"". 1"
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie             ,joemamaohio,,animation,2008,NA,"Those lovable VeggieTales are back on the big screen in ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."" In the 17th Century, evil Robert the Terrible (Cam Clarke) has kidnapped the King's son, Alexander (Yuri Lowenthal), and his sister Bernadette (Cydney Trent) uses a special capsule her father gave her to summon help.In the modern time, George, Sedgewick and Elliot are busboys for a famous dinner theater, wishing they were really pirates. Soon they're transported to the 17th Century, and are now called upon to be heroes...even though they're all scared to death! VeggieTales is one of the best cartoon series for children. It teaches moral lessons without having it jammed down your throat, and even for grown-ups (like myself), I found the film to be surprisingly entertaining and hilarious (I mean, who wouldn't laugh at vegetables fainting?"
Prom Night             ,scummieB,1,horror,2008,1,"Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums. You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the Bank Job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and In Bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. It would be money better spent.It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much I don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) So in summary 'not good'"
What Happens in Vegas             ,insomniac_rod,1,comedy,2010,6,"To be completely honest, I only expected this movie to be popcorn fun. I started very weak and extremely cheesy. The way Cameron Díaz shows Ashton Kutcher the ring after he wins in Vegas is one of the cheesiest scenes I've seen in Hollywood's crap.Then the movie gets really dull, pointless, and not funny. Fortunately, it gets better on the second half and that's because it takes an unconventional way in difference with similar movies.Towards the ending it gets actually funny and almost creative.The performances are just fine. Cameron Díaz is always sexy and bubbly. Her legs are a delight to watch. Ashton Kutcher is good in this role. Just as goofy as ever. Lake Bell is the highlight in my opinion. She's extremely hot, candy for the eye, and her performance is actually funny. I liked when she was called stripper and when Jason S.'s character draws an obscene picture to her during the court meeting. The guest cameos are funny. Zack G. is hilarious.Watch this movie only if it airs on cable. It's not worth your money but it's up for a few good laugh"
Stop-Loss             ,paul2001sw-1,0,drama,2011,7,"'Stop-Loss' deals with the problems soldiers have in getting out of the army; both through the technical procedure of ""Stop-Loss"", whereby a solider is sent back for a second consecutive tour of duty, but also through the difficulties of adjusting to civilian life after time on the front line. Many dramas set after the Vietnam war explored the idea that the sense of a victory well won (absent then, as now) might be critical to enabling a soldier to make the transition from combat animal back to member of civic society. The film is well made, powerfully acted, and doesn't pretend that it's characters are angels (although it justly acknowledges their bravery). But it doesn't really go very far beyond its premise, and the ending is given a slightly more upbeat (but inconclusive) spin than could have been applied. The final credits remind us of the startling high number of American troops to have fought in Afghanistan or Iraq in the 21st century; wars that are fought (for good or bad) while the rest of us get on with our lives in an altogether easier plac"
"Surfer, Dude             ",stespostill,0,comedy,2009,2,"Brutal! Matthew M. is just too cool for words. That must be what he believes if he signed on for this project. It's as if he's okay with the movie not having a beginning, middle, end or anything that resembles a story. He seems to be perfectly okay with just having his face on the screen, acting too cool for words and uttering ultra ""spicoli-esc"" comments.I recently viewed, what I thought was the worst movie ever made, ""Extreme Movie"" and figured nothing would be able to contend with this!!, The I saw ""Surfer Dude"".This movie compares to nothing I've seen before. It's hard to put into words how pathetic this thing is. I chose to add ""contains spoiler"" to this comment, even though there is no way to spoil the plot in this film, because there isn't one! The movie starts to irritate at it's onset. It goes nowhere and offers nothing. I did not laugh once. I found the supporting cast to come across as completely uninterested and just plain bored. This was quite obviously just a vehicle to get McConaughey's face back ""out there"". I was disappointed to see that Scot Glen had participated in this, he's done some good things in the past.With Matthew wearing the same pair of ""cat in the hat"" surfer shorts for the entire length of the movie, which goes on for months, I now have no doubt that, the rumors about fellow actors complaining about working with him because of his poor hygiene and foul body odor, are nothing but absolute Fact! The only conclusion I can come up with for this movie being produced is perhaps it's the economy. I guess we should expect to see more ""cheap"" films coming our way with actors feeling forced to participate in them just so they can keep their faces in ours"
Deception             ,bobaslave,0,crime,2010,4,"Deception...that's exactly what this movie is...very disappointing! Poor acting, bad plot, and the end is terrible. Details like how a random accountant gets a fake passport, a mind of a detective and leaves 20 million bucks in a park! Pur nonsense...i wanted to rate this 1 but i got a little entertained for the first 30min so I gave a 4!Accountant Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor) is an auditor with little to no social life.

Step Up 2: The Streets             ,sarahalub,0,misc,2008,2,"Its a film about dance...but unlike the 80's, where films about dance were, although not that great, loved due to their element of campy fun, (I'm sure 'Footloose' wasn't intended to be a groundbreaking reflection of the struggles of American youth)step up 2 is actually just a really bad film, which happens to be about dance. Kind of like when they make a really bad film which happens to be about rapping, or a really bad film which happens to be about gangs...its in that vein of things.The first problem lies with the fact that this film is actually called 'step up 2 the streets' and lacks punctuation in the main film title (very thankful for IMDb to actually use the initiative to include a hyphen). Anyways the 'film' itself is crying out for one key ingredient...a script. They say that there's only a certain amount of story lines in the world, this film very much backs up this theory. I wonder, where have i seen this scenario before? Save the last dance? you've been served? Honey?...no seriously my mind's gone blank...where could a dance-off/turf war/love story combo have possibly been included in a movie before? curious.Apart from the storyline/characters/dialogue epitomising everything I could possibly loath in a movie neatly rolled into one, its the reverse racism in this film thats my main problem. Did the makers not think 'hmmm...we might offend young black men by portraying them as controlling, criminal, aggressive members of society who's only purpose in life is turf war..but hey, why not take the risk'...which they did, and unbelievably enough it also manages to be racist towards everyone..young white kids too... by making the entire cast look like illiterate baggy-trouser-wearing ridiculous-hand-gesture laughable-one liner idiots.The horrific use of slang is mind-numbingly awful, and the wardrobe guys really didn't need to make everyone look so er 'bright'. Plot itself involves young, poor white girl from the hood with a black legal guardian (powerful!), and her story..in the world of dance. oh did i mention there's a turf war? not a social reflection...just a bit naff.Dancing was good though."
The Objective             ,Tygalilly,,horror,2008,1,"Terrible. That about sums it up. I, too, was at the world premiere screening at the Tribeca Film Festival and was sitting two rows behind the director. If I didn't get a free ticket to this screening, I might have had the nerve to ask him for my $15 back. The plot was unconvincing, the acting was beyond sub-par, and it felt like it was taking forever to get to the point of their ""Objective"". I must have checked my watch at least five times throughout the movie. There was only ONE scene in the entire movie that compelled me to feel invested in some of the characters. But, on the whole, this was lazy film-making at its laziest. Voiceovers that uttered cliché after cliché, over and over again just made me want rip my ears off. To wit, the relative monotone voice of lead Jonas Ball was perhaps supposed to represent the team's logic and authority in this mission, but all it did was make me roll my eyes when he spoke, reminding me that, yes, this movie has an absolutely horrible script and its laughable examples of insightful dialogue are insulting to anyone with mostly functioning senses.And the ending! My GOD, the ending was head-scratching and completely useless. USELESS! This director shouldn't make any more films. Ever.Do NOT see this movie. You'll thank me for warning you, I promise."
Goodbye Solo             ,roy-c,0,drama,2015,4,"I struggled to get through to the end. Clearly quite a lot of people rated this film, but I merely found it dull with little in the way of plot or pace. These are major and fatal flaws. I have had to read some of the other reviews to even work out what actually happened.The actors did what they could, and were generally very convincing. Some of the camera-work was also of a high standard. I'm no fan of frantic films filled with over-acting, but this is not the first film where I longed for something - anything - to happen to relieve the boredom.When you're watching a film with someone else and after 45 minutes you're saying ""well it's supposed to be good and I'm sure it'll improve"", that's not a good sign. It wasn't and it didn'"
The Lucky Ones             ,dead47548,,adventure,2008,9,"Three soldiers are home from Iraq; a 40-ish Tim Robbins out for good and the young Michael Pena and Rachel McAdams on a thirty day leave. Each has their own problem that they are faced with at the beginning of the film. Robbins comes home to a wife who wants a divorce and a son who needs $20,000 for college, Pena suffered a wound that has made him impotent and McAdams lost her friend and wants to find his family in order to return his guitar and live with them since she's lost any ties with her own. Think every problem is going to be solved in a little bow by the end? Well, you'd be right. Think that it's going to really typical and schmaltzy? Not so much on that one. It seems like a film that's made for the obvious ups and downs throughout but it actually manages to be quite original and refreshing. Instead of feeling like a film that's just about resolving the individual situations, it's a lot more carefree and a lot more about these three people simply enjoying life together and keeping one another joyful.Of course there are many different stops on the way to their ultimate destinations in order to give us some situations of them interacting in the real world, but each one is a lot of fun and we gain a little more depth to the characters at each stop. All of the characters are well-fleshed out and don't feel like just another retread of stereotypes we've seen over and over again. One of the things that really surprised me is that when a little romance starts to bloom between Pena and McAdams, I didn't roll my eyes like I would have expected but instead I smiled and enjoyed watching this flirtation grow between the two of them in a non-typical way. And all the way through we are treated to three strong performances from three solid actors.The real star is Rachel McAdams, who I'd say is Oscar-worthy. She keeps the laughs coming all the way through and steals every single scene with her bright eyes and southern drawl, but you can tell that there is real emotion brimming just under the surface. She's a girl who has every reason to hate life with a fury, but she remains optimistic and tries to get those around her to enjoy living just as much as she does. One scene in particular, when she finally meets the family of her fallen friend, is a showcase for what an extraordinary actress she is. This is her best performance by a long shot, and definitely one of the best of the year. The Lucky Ones is something that could have been obvious and clichéd, but ended up being just the opposite; a refreshing and very well-acted story that I wish wasn't destined to be forgotten come awards season."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,harry_tk_yung,0,misc,2009,NA,"It took me a while into this 2-hour Cannes Jury Prize winner to decide for myself its genre. I finally decided to call it an avant-garde biography-documentary, regardless of what other people may say. The subject of study is 7-time Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. In his award winning (European Film Award) portrayal, Tony Servillo brings to the screen a Andreotti that is ""calm, ambiguous, inscrutable"" (08 Cannes Official Program's introduction). With a slouching Nosferatu pose and hands clasped like Jack Benny (with apt sarcastic humour), Servillo does project an enigmatic aura, which is further enhanced by varied, surreal presentations ranging from Katino-style stoicism to rapid-fire monologue, depending on which particular scene. Deciphering Andreotti alone is a mesmerising endeavour, which the audience can undertake through following his manoeuvres to stay in power (first half of the film) to the Mafia-connection charges he faces after losing power (second half). A hint of what this man really is has been given right at the beginning of the film. He intimates to a priest that he prefers talking to priests rather than to God, because ""a priest votes, God doesn't"". But later in the movie, he says that what he really wants to be is a cultured man (e.g. chairman of a music society) than a statesman. The film is shot in a rich profusion of colours, ranging from misty moody orange to bright glaring blue, and everything in between. In no less proliferation is the varied background music, classical, pop, lively syncopation, wailing strings, rousing vocals<U+0085>..and a lot more. ""Il Divo"" is a rare cinematic adventur"
Gran Torino             ,nanturn,0,drama,2009,7,"Although I am a big fan of Eastwood and have enjoyed most of his films, I found Gran Torino to be overly sentimental and I'm confused by the high IMDb rating. The plot thread is almost banal - why would the tough Asian gang devote so much effort in pursuit of the teenage boy who did not want to be a member? and lacked credibility - the sick old man was able to intimidate these gang members? and is too familiar - hardened racist comes around, honorable man sacrifices his life for justice and absolves himself of past sins through his last actions on earth, etc., etc. And I disagree with the comment that viewers were permitted to 'make up our own minds'. In this film, the moral of the story was in the viewer's face and an emotional response was overtly solicited. Compared to Unforgiven, a film that was both powerful and subtle, and avoided obvious moral judgments, Gran Torino is an amateurish piece."
Frygtelig lykkelig             ,cjaye,0,crime,2011,NA,"SPOILER ALERT: Brilliant. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about it because I was rooting so hard for the lead that when I found out he was so flawed I was upset. I wanted him to be a good guy. I felt bad for him, but at the same time knowing he was not a good person. But even saying that is simplistic, because he's so three dimensional, you just see him as a victim of his circumstances and yet... you want him to do the right thing but know if you were in his shoes it would be difficult. So many great little touches from the little girl with the squeaky carriage to how he gradually comes to accept the town. Visually it's wonderful and the acting is terrific. So many odd characters. Funny enough to me, it felt like a REALLY DARK Hot Fuzz. Though I do see the Cohen Brother influence especially the influence of Blood Simple. This movie was surprising and fresh. I also thought it was interesting in the very last scene when they dealt him cards but when the camera pulled back there were no cards on the table. Some say this was a mistake. I wonder. To me it felt like it was saying ""Things are not what they seem"" just like the little town where nothing goes wrong... not what it seem"
Garden Party             ,jayraskin1,1,drama,2011,NA,"People looking for action and thrills should watch another movie. This is for people looking for character driven movies which bring smiles, rather than laughs. Although obviously low budget, everything in the film was quite professional. All the acting was good and the camera-work was equal to any good television series. Standouts were Vinessa Shaw as real estate Sally St. Claire and Willa Holland as April. I haven't seen either before, but they both presented warm and delightful characters. Richard Gunn as Todd and Erik Smith as Sammy also showed themselves adept at light humor.I hope that Jason Freeland, the writer-director, gets a chance to do more stuff. He handles this material very well. While there's only a touch of nudity in the film, there is a nice subtle erotic vibe to the film with most scenes centering on some aspect of sexualit"
W.             ,supah79,0,misc,2009,5,"I used to be an Oliver Stone fan. But after Natural Born Killers I read in an interview that he had doubts about continuing his directing career. ""I don't think I have another good movie in me"".Well, I still think that he does, but W. isn't it. The reason I like and watch Oliver Stone films is that he has a strong opinion about a subject. One that isn't mainstream, but expresses it in such a way, that he wins his audience and therefore can change popular opinion. The best examples for this are Platoon and JFK.Oliver Stone makes a decision with this film which I do not like. The life and times of George W. Bush offer enough subject matter to make a powerful, semi-documentary film with hard hitting political and religious views that would sturr up popular belief. But instead of going for the jugular, Stone takes W. on his knee, pats him gently on the head and says: ""I know, son. I get it."" The film has all the elements that make W. the infamous guy that he is: the invention of axes-of-evil, God is on the side of good (The US of A), W.'s history of failed business, tale-chasing and alcohol abuse. Add the wheeling and dealing by the Bush-dynasty and you would think it's dynamite stuff.But it's not. The script is superficial. Tame at best. Stone is not good at satire and this film shows us why. Anyone who reads the Sundaypaper and watches the nine-o-clock news could have written this movie. It has the character motivation of a soap-opera. The father-son relationship for me was totally unbelievable. I expected a true depiction, with close source material. But it has become an imagined portrait by the screenwriter. Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of insight into the kitchen of the (right-wing) Bush-Administration, more over: the infiltration of the Hawks in the White House. This film doesn't add anything new or reveal any new insights. The movie is based on research done by outsiders. I knew every detail of this movie because I am up to current events. I don't want a summation and lovable depiction of a man who is responsible for eight very defining years of US foreign policy. I wanted new insights, make me doubt my own beliefs and discuss this with friends and on message boards. The end result has me shrugging my shoulders and saying: Eehh..., so what? "
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,alexandermangoldt,1,misc,2008,7,"I watched the movie at a teacher's screening in Wuppertal on a Sunday morning. I was quite impressed with the accurate and detailed portrayal of the RAF and the events of the so called 'German fall' (Deutscher Herbst). I myself knew of many of the events beforehand and thanks to documentaries such as Veiel's Black Box BRD and Breloer's Todesspiel I was able to compare. For the two and some hours that the movie lasted I was on the edge of my seat. None of the scenes were boring, everything was well paced (at times maybe a little too fast paced) and I felt like I was being taken back to the important past of my native country. However, at the end I felt a little empty. The documentaries I just mentioned focused on only one story, but these documentaries were better because they gave us an in-depth analysis of the opposing forces (the bourgeoisie, the elite and the socialist rebels). The portrayal of Meinhof and Baader seems accurate, too, but often I wondered if Baader really was the small-time crook he's made out to be in the movie. Except for Meinhof and Ensslin nobody seems to have some really deep thoughts about what was (is) wrong with our society. Mohnhaupt played by Nadja Uhl isn't explained at all, she's just there all of a sudden and we just go along thinking that she is in it for the same reasons as everybody else (Which are???).That way the movie seemed a little biased, as if trying to tell us that the RAF was mainly criminal and not so much political. Although I believe that a lot of their motives were right, even though they didn't justify any of the actions. Bruno Ganz as Herold is allowed to play his character in a way that everyone thinks of the German government at the time as a dignified and moderate administration although I don't believe that to be true (after all, Herold said that he can only cure the symptoms of the RAF disease but not the disease itself, yet he didn't do anything to make the German people understand that the RAF is not altogether wrong when it accuses the German people of laziness, cowardice and complacency). Now, leaving the movie, I figured that there was nothing much left to talk about. The teacher material that we received was pretty useless, because it doesn't offer any interesting topics for discussion. I for one think it would be interesting to discuss the present situation (bureaucracy, war in Iraq, terrorism) with the situation of Germany in the 70's. We are still dealing with many of the problems that caused the insurgency and civil disobedience back then, yet today we don't do anything at all. We are dissatisfied with the Bush administration, we oppose the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, we suffer from a financial crisis mainly caused by the deregulated free market economy (capitalism) and we watch the divide between the rich and the poor getting bigger and bigger.However, the youth of today doesn't protest. Why not? Maybe because we taught them well that in the end it's everyone for themselves and that it's best to be obedient, docile and commonorgarden if you want at least a little security in your life. One of the stronger scenes was the one where Ensslin accuses Meinhof of jerking off on her socialist theories instead of actually doing something. That's where you can see how Meinhof was influenced by the RAF. Finally she met some people who were willing to take action instead of just talking and philosophizing about a better world. This scene lends itself well to the follow-up scene in which Meinhof helps Baader to escape from prison. The jump from the window sill is a the same time a jump towards extremism. Well, all in all, I think it's a good film to get people interested in Germany's past but it can only be the beginning of a more subtle analysis of what the RAF stood for and what it was trying to do. 1"
The Other Boleyn Girl             ,OrleansB,1,misc,2008,7,"The second half of this movie almost gave me a BLOODY HEART ATTACK! MAN THAT WAS DISTURBING! Ignore the false advertisements that make this movie look like a romantic bodice-ripper. One can call it a soap-opera, but you CANNOT call it a romantic period drama! For those of yous who don't know your Tudor history don't worry, you don't need too (on second thought it'll probably be better if you don't know the story), just treat this as a FICTIONAL eye-opener (and yes, it is extremely historically incorrect) OKay...disturbing themes and historical inaccuracies aside, the movie has brilliant acting by it's leads. Johansson is very capable and believable as Mary (yes, I know...I'm shocked too), whilst Portman is psychotically intense as Anne (I'll explain later). The supporting cast is decent, Kristen Scott Thomas is morally in-tune in the Boleyns' mother and Jim Sturgess is BRILLIANT as their tragic brother George.The story on the other hand is WAY too rushed (you can SO CLEARLY tell that sonypictures butchered this movie up...BADLY, thus I'll be waiting for a director's cut indefinitely).OK...first half of this movie is DULLer than the movie's god-awful cinematography, the audiences' disinterest is NOT helped by Peter Morgan's lazy script. The first half drags and drags....UNTIL the director and writer decides to go all HAPPY TREE FRIENDS on the lead characters (and I don't mean in the bloody fun way either).Whilst Scarlett Johansson's Mary remains the movie's 'somewhat' moral center....Natalie Portman's Anne goes bloody bizerk (yes, in the crazy psychotic bitch sense)...kudos to her for bringing such intensity and whatever realism she can to the (clearly bias) role, although at points you may what to strangle Anne for her conniving ruthlessness, you nevertheless feel for her (and especially her brother) in the end.Make no mistake, this is NOT a movie for the soft-hearted, as I explained before the second half contains MANY series of disturbing stomach-wrenching events that will leave you clutching your seat (or packet of Orange TicTac in my case) making the first ELIZABETH movie seem like the most feel-good movie of 1999. SO CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED! All in all, bad direction, awesome acting and melodramatically disturbing story with a beautiful score by Paul Cantelon and gorgeous costumes by Sandy Powell. A would overall give it a generous 7 stars out of 10.I hope I left this review as spoiler free as possible. "
Shutter             ,robertallenandersonjr,0,horror,2008,7,"Shutter was a pretty decent movie. The movie was pretty predictable. People will probably not like this movie because of the ending. The thing that people need to realize is that when they are going to see a movie like this you know what you are going to get out of it. I hate it when people keep cutting down movies like this, such as One Missed Call and The Eye. In these kind of movies the ending is pretty predictable, its pretty much going to leave you hanging. Thats why I think people need to understand you can't hate a movie because of the ending. I thought that their was so much more to the story than just spirit photography. It explains why its happening to the people that are on their honey moon. It seems like in these kind of movies the story explains a lot more near the end. They kept doing many flash backs in this movie as well. That's when they were explaining the story a lot. This was actually pretty creepy, freightning, and scary all at the same time. It had a ton of sudden pop out right at your face scenes. Im sure that when you see this you will jump many times. I thought that it could have been a little bit better. I liked the idea of having it be two newly married couples that this spirit photography is happening to. I liked how the wife was fighting the ghosts the whole movie. The acting was surprisingly really good I thought. The wife in this played by Rachael Taylor did such a great job playing all the scared parts and emotional parts. Her husband played by Joshua Jackson did a great job as well. Some of the visuals were pretty sweet. They had a lot of nice camera shots of the whole city in Tokyo. After some of the people left the theater I heard them say I want my money back. This movie was trying to prove to you that making fun of people and treating them like crap at a younger age will come back to haunt you. Overall this was a decent movie with some good scares. I would go see this at the cheap show or only pay five dollars."
Death Race             ,wordmonkey,0,action,2008,8,"Now here's an exploitation film that knows what a solid B-movie is supposed to be: an action-dense, amped-up, gore-soaked killfest. It's the cinematic equivalent of eating that entire box of Red Vines you bought at the snack bar, using them as candy straws to suck down your extra-large Coke.As a fan of the original ""Death Race 2000,"" I was pleased to see just enough of a shadow of the original movie inhabiting the skin of the new one. Roger Corman's name on the producing credits gave me hope at the start, and his seal of approval seemed to mean something, perhaps as counterweight to Paul W. S. Anderson's track record of shooting mediocre video game adaptations. Surprisingly, Anderson rises to the occasion, effortlessly elevating a cliché-rich but fast-moving script to the level of a satisfyingly adrenalin-fueled confection aimed like a bullet at the A.D.D.-addled brains of the short-attention-span generation.Set in an ""Escape From New York""-style dystopic prison-culture (that sounds suspiciously like current American society), slaughter happens, stuff blows up, and the weak are culled like bunnies caught in the headlights of gas-sucking American muscle cars. Fans of the ""Twisted Metal"" video game will love the newest wrinkle in the race, the addition of weaponry <U+0096> a needed bloody bump for version 2.0. And what a bump it is, with each car's chugging machine guns indiscriminately spewing hot rounds at every foe, shredding Detroit steel like it was used Kleenex. It's unabashed gun fetishism at its gleeful best, and it makes you want to strap an M60 to the hood of your Prius in order to cut your commute in half.Jason Statham does his standard tough-guy job as the scowling Frankenstein, Joan Allen plays a ball-busting warden (perhaps a bit in the mold of Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched), and Ian McShane of ""Deadwood"" has a solid cameo as the prison-wise mechanic, Coach. Even Machine Gun Joe gets a new incarnation in the form of Tyrese Gibson, who thankfully is nothing like Stallone's blustering Italian meatball.I loved it, and can't wait to see it again in a theater with enough bass to pump up those impact crunches to the bone-jarring level they deserve.Yeah! 1"
Frozen River             ,bizlift,1,crime,2008,8,"Frozen River is not a glamorous Hollywood film. It's a bleak indie film about struggling to survive.I found it well written with strong performances by Melissa Leo & Charlie McDermott.The movie was very moody with some intense scenes and generated a strong emotional response for me. The setting and simple production worked very well with the atmosphere of the story.And, not to give away anything...the ending is ""satisfying"" without tying up things impossibly neat or without being too predictable.I feel the current average rating as of writing this review is not close to being appropriate. Perhaps there is some conspiracy as all of the films listed in the Sundance Dramatic Competition have a huge number of 2 ratings, many more 2's than any other rating. It seems a bit weird to be a coincidence that majority of ratings for these new films would all be 2.

Frozen River             ,aharmas,1,crime,2008,10,"Here is a story that dares to explore a side of this country rarely seen in mainstream cinemas, a movie that subtly shows the politics of the drama which females must endure without the support of the male. For years we have admired the resilience of tough mother who endures all kinds of ordeals to protect her own, a woman who fears nothing and conquer all. We have seen honored and represent a political or ecological affiliation in films like ""Norma Rae"" and ""Silkwood"". Yes, they are female and strong and represent all of us, our indignation, the pain of our community.""Frozen Rivers"" is not taking political sides; as a matter of fact, it appears to condemn the very act that gets our two main characters in trouble. It focuses on the issues of survival and protection. The American Dream is already shattered. What matters now is to survive on something other than cereal and Tang.Something smolders in this film, and it is the performance of Leo, as Ray, the mother who cries and fears the worst, but who doesn't understand the meaning of quitting. She is willing to compromise her views and push herself beyond what she has endured so far in order to feed and protect her children. She also learns that there might be others who are worse off than she is. She has lost a husband, but what do the others have? Why are they willing to take those chances and endure slavery? ""Frozen River"" does not have a happy ending, but there is plenty of hope in it, as we know that the worst is probably over. There are some exchanges, strategically placed between the main characters to know that we are willing to forgive and compromise, in order to allow for more growth and improvement.It's a deceptively quiet film, but it does possess a very strong voice."
Death Race             ,the-movie-guy,0,action,2008,8,"Synopsis - In 2012, the United States economy collapses and life for everyone is not the same. Once a NASCAR champion, Jensen Ames, (Jason Statham), hits rock bottom and spent several years in prison. His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy (Janaya Stephens) and having a baby girl. Then the steel mill closes, and he loses his job. But that was not the worst thing to happen to Jenson that day. Suzy is brutally murdered, and he is framed for her murder. Jenson is sent to Terminal Island, the worst and toughest for-profit prison in the country run by Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). She has created the country's most popular pay-per-view sport, a kill-or-be-killed car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins. Every inmate driver is driving a monster car that they built which is loaded with machine guns, missiles, flamethrowers, napalm, and no rules. Warden Hennessey convinces Jensen to secretly take the place of the late 4-time superstar winner, Frankenstein, and wear his metallic mask in the race. If Jensen wins just one race, he can go home to his baby daughter. To get to the finish line, Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.My Comment - This is kind of a remake inspired by the 1975 movie, ""Death Race 2000,"" in name only. This movie stands on its own. The title ""Death Race"" tells it all. If you want to see an action pack race where all the drivers go through a gauntlet of death, then this movie is for you. There are some scenes that take the race to the max. If you ever had road rage, I am sure you would love to be driving one of these cars. You can see why the for-profit prison puts on these races, because I calculated that they would make a tremendous profit of $12.5 billion for 3 pay-per-view races. Jason Statham played his usually part as the tough kick-ass Jensen Ames very well. I know everybody will like the ending. (Universal Pictures, 1:39 minutes, Rated R)(8/10)"
Bedtime Stories             ,farkasdeb,0,adventure,2008,9,"I have never been an Adam Sandler fan as he seemed to be an actor for humor geared towards teens...but I really enjoyed this movie. I took my 4 year old to see it and didn't expect to like it as much as I did. This is THE perfect family movie that is funny and magical and a bit silly. It actually can be enjoyed by all ages in the family...even the teenagers. Sometimes we all need to relax and laugh and imagine. Bedtime Stories does that. I left the theater feeling like I had spent my money well on this movie. I recommended the movie to my teens and other families. Unless you are the over-serious type, you won't be disappointed."
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,riverbythesea,1,misc,2009,10,"I have seen this movie twice. I have an alternate title: Bonnie and Klaus in Wild West Germany. You have to consider these are the children of WW2 Germany, and they got to experience the resurrection of West Germany, another economic miracle (funded by US tax payers under the Truman Doctrine). So, they were living quite well and feeling guilty about everyone in the third world living like dogs. But I have to say it was a bit of an over reaction. But I figure their intensity is just another example of how a younger generation responds to a society crisis, and they feared Fascism. But like the late Bobby Fuller sang in a song, ""I fought the law and the law won."" The establishment cannot be beat. They have the resources, which can easily squish ideology. But this film is a good educational resource. I had heard of the Baader-Meinhoff Gang and the Red Army Faction, but knew very little, as this film revealed to me. I suggest doing some research about Baader-Meinhoff before seeing this film. It won't spoil it, as it may actually make it a little more coherent as the events unfold. This is a keeper for me, and I will own the DVD"
Gomorrah             ,claudio_carvalho,,crime,2010,4,"When I write a review in IMDb, I usually begin with a plot summary to give the big picture of the movie. Unfortunately it is impossible to write a summary of ""Gomorra"" since there is no lead story and no lead character since the screenplay entwines a bunch of messy and boring little subplots without any development of any character or situation. Therefore the viewer watches a sequence of illegal activities of the Italian Mafia, trafficking drugs, executing competitors and manipulating toxic waste and roping children and youths in their business. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Gomorra"""
Good Dick             ,wingedheartart,1,misc,2009,6,"I always check the spoiler box, just in case.There was one comment that said something like he/she was sure out of all the people in this world, that there were probably people like those in the movie. Well. More than a few. I mean, unless I am WAY off here, I figured out the minute she was looking at photos of a little girl (herself) that her dad had to have done something physical to her. Thus, the guilt and control he felt/had over her...with the apartment, money, criticisms. I've known TOO many women who have been molested by uncles, grandfathers, brothers, neighbors...and no, I haven't worked in a crisis center. Just women I've met over the years. So, her extreme introversion and warped view of sex and love and the dirtiness of a male member....all fits with a woman who was molested by someone....most likely someone she trusted or should have been able to trust. This was a difficult movie to watch. Because I am a woman, I've known so many who were hurt, changed forever from the person they were MEANT to be. Jason Ritter was really good. Vulnerable, persistent, loving. He reminded me of his dad at times...sweet eyes. Enjoy the movie...if you know someone who was hurt/molested as a child...be wary and love them despite their scars. Just a suggestion. "
The House Bunny             ,Otoboke,1,comedy,2008,NA,"Ladies and gentlemen, imagine if you will the concept of cinematic schizophrenia. It's okay if you don't quite grasp the idea behind this concept because I just then made it up especially for this review. However, should a movie ever adopt the illness that is cinematic schizophrenia, it will undoubtedly in some way or another resemble the bewildering mess that is House Bunny. Here is a film that is one thing, then another, and then another and so on. It's a feature that gives the audiences some genuine laughs, and yet tacks on drama so soppy and melodramatic that it's hard to take anything in the vicinity of its presence with any degree of sincerity. There's also some brilliant performances, and yet the thespians involved are neglected to play out shady, two dimensional cut outs for characters; going through act one, two and three with a different wardrobe, and a whole new personality to match. What hurts the movie most however isn't this mix of successful elements with mundane ones, but the collision that occurs when they try to blend; House Bunny is a confusing, disjointed affair that entertains sporadically and yet has around the same amount of potential to irritate and bore. In the end, much like a ""bunny"" in reality, this isn't going to give the brain cells much company and whatever fun is had will be quickly forgotten in no time; shallow, trite and ridiculously unfocused, House Bunny should be fine enough for teenage girls looking for some brain dead amusement, but for anyone else, this is material best left alone.Following the story of ugly neglected orphan turned Playboy centrefold wannabe turned homeless bimbo, House Bunny opts to tell the classic tale of 'be yourself and always appreciate those closest to you'. The problem with this isn't just that the movie fails to change any of the formula associated with this cliché concoction but that it instead contorts elements beyond recognition which in turn distorts any sense of conviction within the script. Furthermore, with three distinct acts that draw their borders just about as obviously as their characters go through personality changes, the film adopts a jolted structure that plays out all too obviously and predictably. Throughout the tale we see characters go from one thing to another and then meeting somewhere in the middle by the end; it's nothing that hasn't been done before, so many times. Yet where House Bunny gets most irksome is in the extent that characters shift focus, resulting in tired clichés that fail to create any resonance with the audience beyond grabbing a few stilted laughs. As a direct result, it is the feature's first act that plays off the most successfully, meshing likable characters with not so likable ones in a manner that seems almost satirical in its charm. Unfortunately, this sense of consistency and intrigue soon dispels once the movie sets up its driving force for the central theme, resulting in ideas rather than characters interacting with each other; this isn't engaging drama by any means, no matter how hard it tries. Sure enough there's somewhat of a decent message to be taken back, but it's too far behind all this confused jumble of caricature nonsense to be taken seriously.To say that the feature is without its merits however would be a small misjudgement. House Bunny certainly isn't anything worth looking into, but should you be subjected to watching it, there are a few hidden gems in amongst all the dirt. Most of these highlights, as stated earlier, lie in the performances of the main cast, and while most are given nothing but lame characterisation to work with, most get the job done and pull some decent laughs out of their limited bag of tricks. Anna Faris who by now is more than comfortable in these kinds of slapstick roles, is particularly convincing in her position here, making the most of her ditzy persona and fleshing her out to be just a little more engaging than she should otherwise be. Emma Stone in what is only her third feature also gives a memorable performance in her own right, outdoing her lukewarm outing in lacklustre The Rocker by quite some distance. It goes without saying that her character suffers the most from this schizophrenia I referred to earlier, and Stone certainly entertains more as Act One Nerd, but consistency aside, she adds an air of vibrant ambiance that counters Faris' more eccentric glow.Aside from those elements however, plus the undeniable fact that most will find something to laugh at here, then House Bunny falls flat. It's a tepid effort for sure, eager to please its target audience of teenage girls with little aspiration to reach anyone else, and for that the feature can get more than tiresome in between the more amusing and engaging parts. Certainly not a movie to be taken seriously by any means, director Fred Wolf never quite seems to grasp the script's notably tongue-in-cheek nature, and instead delivers a black and white rendition of the now sloppily vague ""believe in yourself and you will be happy"" story. The drama is pointless, the characters ridiculously incoherent, and the themes are underdeveloped to the point where all hope is lost underneath rubble of mismatched ideas and talents. I'm sure some audiences will get a kick out of it, but I wasn't one of them. I laughed a few times, and I very rarely got bored, but that's not saying much. This is for teenage girls in search for silly, ditzy fun with no brains and no heart either; anyone else should look elsewhere.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
Sex and the City             ,Darkweasel,1,comedy,2008,1,"My wife watched the TV series. In other words that means I had to watch the TV series. I didn't hate it. A lot of episodes were good, some were bad, the rest were just average.This film was an insult to any fan of the show and I'm surprised so many ""real fans"" were suckered in by it. What happened to the characters? Well, for the most part the couples were needlessly pulled apart merely as a plot device to put them back together again later on in another glaringly obvious saccharine reunion scene. The only story which actually seemed natural was Samantha's, and Charlotte's baby story was a slap in the face to the TV series. Also, what was with the clothes? Did the makers intentionally try to make the stars of the show look as ridiculous and old as possible. I'm sorry, but Sarah Jessica Parker has the arms of a 60 year old and they should not be highlighted in any way. The ginger one's (2nd?) haircut did her no favours whatsoever unless she actually wanted to look seventy years old.In short, I may only be a bloke so most/all women on here will immediately shrug their shoulders and say I don't know what I'm talking about. However, I do know enough to realise when a show's creator is manipulating and cheating the very audience who helped make him successful."
Il divo - La spettacolare vita di Giulio Andreotti             ,tgf001,0,misc,2010,10,"This is one of those movies where you need to be up for active entertainment (read: awake and willing to process data and moments quickly). For the very same reason some people give this movie bad reviews as they are upset that the Director (Sorrentino) does not bother with explaining the history of Italian Politics after World War II and the influence Andreotti had on this. If he had to do such for an unknown to understand the story line, the movie would be one hour longer or it would become a pointless exercise and most likely a tiring one for most of the audience. This movie is made for an Italian speaking audience with knowledge of Italian Politics - not a Hollywood blah blah movie.Personally, I was a little familiar with the background of Italian Politics but spent a significant amount of time after the first viewing to learn more about entities such as the P2 (Porpaganda due) lodge, Gladio (NATO ""Stay behind"" organisation), The main characters from the Christian Democrat party as well as a few gentlemen from the Island of Sicily. In light of this sin flood of information I watched the movie a second time and was frankly baffled by it's incredible way of telling such a complicated story in such short period of time.Speking only a bit Italian but coming from a non English mother tongue country I was able to understand many parts of the movie without subtitles. I am however used to reading subtitles of non-English movies, which might ruin the experience for people who are not used to such due to the speed of dialogues and the general amount of data released during the 110 minute high speed portray of much more than Il Divo Giulio himself - it is about Italy as a country...Long story short, if you appreciate Italian way of life, accept that the Mafia is something as part of their society (let it be Sicilian, Calabria or Napolitano), you enjoy style, class, quality, good food and music as well as the fact that things might just not be inside what it says on the tin then this is a movie for you. If you rather look for an easy digestible film after work, do not speak Italian and have no interest in reading subtitles, do not like ambiguity in scenes and do not like to put the movie together in your head afterwards - then this is certainly not a movie for you...If you do not know about Italian Politics and want to grasp this movie at first viewing read on the internet about Andreotti, Craxi and ""the years of Lead"" for 20 minutes before going to the Cinema.Enjo"
The Strangers             ,idrow,,horror,2008,1,"I couldn't even get through this movie. The whole first 45 minutes revolves around trying to explain the fact that they can't go for help and it's just ridiculous. First of all, nobody leaves their house without their phone charged. Liv Tyler's character goes out to dinner and when she comes home her phone is dead. Sure. Second, she manages to get to her land line when someone is trying to break into her house. Does she call 911? Nooooo....she calls the boyfriend asking him to come home. Then the land line goes dead. The boyfriend manages to make it home, but *gasp* leaves his cell in his car. He goes out to get the cell and *gasp* it's gone. While he's outside does he go to a neighbor's house for help? Noooo...he goes back inside. Then they decide they have to get out of there so they make it to the car. When they get to the street, they see a car coming at them, so they stop instead of trying to avoid the other car and go around. Then they see a car coming at them from behind. Do they gun the car and go around the one in front? Noooo....they sit there and get hit from behind. What to do now? Run back into the house, of course. I couldn't take any more at this point. Both of them are so useless I don't even care if they get killed at this point.This movie is just frustrating and predictable. Can't Hollywood even make an attempt to come up with something original any more?"
The Brothers Bloom             ,giantpanther,1,action,2009,1,"I thought brick (the directors previous work) was an alright film, although when I went in to see Brothers Bloom I didn't know much about it so I didn't know the director had directed that until later.It was one of those films for me where you go in knowing almost nothing, a rare experience. Unfortunately this film was really crappy, kind of a Wes Anderson wanna be / rip off experience, with lots of ""quirky"" moments. I don't like the word quirky.Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo play brothers who don't look anything like each other. Brody feels guilty about ripping off innocent people, while Ruffalo is a 2 dimensional cliché character that we don't really care about.They decide to steal a bunch of money from Penelope, somewhere in the film Penelope realizes who they are but still likes them. This is where I had a big problem, these men are stealing from her and yet she is fine with it and keeps dumping money into their bank accounts.The opening sequence to this film reminded me of a film school project, just real crappy, bad acting, and trying to hard to be super cute.It wasn't pure agony to sit through this film, but the fact that I think this film THOUGHT of itself as self important and profound compelled me to give it a 1/10 rating.Stay away from this film."
Frost/Nixon             ,Simon_Says_Movies,0,misc,2009,9,"Movies centered on politics are often interesting on an intellectual level, but never has a film of such an ilk been so thoroughly entertaining. Director Ron Howard's adaptation of the stage play of the same name, manages to both stay loyal to the true events that served as inspiration, yet infuses it with life and achieves the utmost level of satisfaction without compromising the rich and weighty subject matter. Infused with sensational performances throughout, Howard has delivered what I think is his best film yet.Beginning with President Richard Nixon's (Frank Langella reprising his role from the play) resignation following the Watergate scandal, the movie jumps to a few years later where the ex-president has been demoted to giving talks at luncheons, and interviews for money. Meanwhile down under in Australia, a wildly popular talk show host named David Frost (Michael Sheen) comes up with the ultimate publicity stunt; winch out the confession the American people never got from their former president. Nixon has other plans however, seeing only easy money for answering some fluff questions over a four day period. Frost assembles a team of researchers and experts including Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., Mathew McFayden as John Burt and Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick to ensure his suave defeat of his opponent and secure their place in infamy.Frost/Nixon succeeds in overcoming a number of hurdles. It flourishes, even if you have no knowledge of the events of Watergate, or have no interest in American politics, but will thrill those who do. From what I understand, certain liberties were taken with the facts surrounding the endlessly notorious interviews, but more often then not, Frost/Nixon is less of a political film, then it is a sword and shield bout to the death; an intense duel between these two intellectuals, and how their confidence and overconfidence sways the interviews in both their favours before the gripping final outcomeFrank Langella is sure to get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the infamous president, but Michael Sheen should by no means be overlooked. He is equally solid, and to some extent has the more difficult role; in keeping his own against the veteran stage actors larger then life embodiment of the president. We also get fantastic supporting work from Kevin Bacon as Nixon's aid who's two-fold admiration and quiet pity and embarrassment is tragic and very affecting. From a visual standpoint, Howard's film is glossy and superbly shot without feeling to large in its scope. It is intimate and immediate with a keen sense of the times. Perhaps the biggest achievement of the movie is the handling of the Nixon character. Howard manages to capture both his corruptness and smug pompousness while showing him as a true human; with some sympathy but mostly just not as a faceless monster and without a blunt bias. So don't be turned away simply because of the films 'political' backbone, because Frost/Nixon is some of the most simultaneously intelligent and entertaining film-making of the decade. 9.5 / 10.0 Read all my reviews at : http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
Death Race             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,action,2008,7,"I wasn't looking for anything deep, I wasn't looking for anything serious, no Oscar winning actors, no award winning script, I just wanted an action movie, this summer we got Death Race, a movie where the script and characters are just never explored, but the action is non stop and so exciting. I don't know why, but we just need action movies like that and one of the things that I did enjoy about this was that it reminded me of those old grind house films that have quick editing and fast paced stories that are just awesome stories to watch because of the stunts. This is a different form of The Fast and The Furious, only just not with all the fancy gadgets which I like. Also, Jason Statham, this guy is just awesome in action movies, he makes such a great lead in any action role and is such an awesome tough guy that you don't want to mess with.Based off the 70's film ""Death Race 2000"", it's 2012, the economy is in bad shape, employment is down, but entertainment is up, especially in prison where racing has become the new gladiator fights. Jenson's wife is murdered and he is framed for it, landing him him in prison, where he is approached by the leader of the Death Race program, Hennessey, and she offers him to race for his freedom if he can make it out alive. But there's something a little deeper when it seems like he was put in prison on purpose so he could race.Death Race is just pure entertainment, it's nothing original, we don't really know the characters that well or what their motives are, but the reason why this movie is enjoyable is just the awesome action that is endless. I loved the editing, it made the race scenes that much more exciting. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for fun, like I said before we just need a pure action movie sometimes and Death Race is a perfect film on that level. I had a great time watching this movie and am looking forward to seeing it again for a good time.7/10"
Sex and the City             ,brefane,1,comedy,2008,3,"Fans of the show will be happy to see the ladies from the HBO series unite once again, but really it would have been better for all concerned if they hadn't bothered because this plot less and pointless big screen rehash diminishes the series. The transfer to the big screen at 2hrs and 25mins exposes the hollowness of the characters that the breezy 1/2 hour episodes concealed, and the film is truly 40 minutes too long. And while the ladies and the world have changed in the ten years since the series began, the movie barely acknowledges this fact. Yes, Jennifer Hudson is on board to demonstrate cultural diversity, but the character is unnecessary. SATC:The Movie appeases its target audience with fashion montages, male nudity, spacious closets, and American Pie humor for giddy schoolgirls. The men are upstaged by the Louis Vuitton bags and Mr. Big is passive and colorless. The director's inexperience in the medium is palpable, and the movie feels like 5 episodes of the series drained of blood, and played back to back. The movie isn't very funny; it lacks true wit and polish, and some of what the script thinks is funny, is embarrassing, and apparently SATC2 is all of the above and worse, so I'll finish the franchise with this limp vehicle. All of the 4 leads have their moments, the girls still have the same chemistry that made the series popular, and as on the series, Cattrall's Samantha is still my favorite. 1"
21             ,Mccadoo,0,crime,2008,6,"Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is ""based on"" so I went in with no pre-conceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely worth a night at the movies however, I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes, I know it's just a movie, but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet, they stayed in suites, walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers, they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again, it just didn't make any sense.Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days, the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore, they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission (because again, he hadn't done anything illegal), and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.The main character's mother offers him a check for $68,000 for medical school, telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this, how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate, huh? Again, the main character hasn't done anything illegal, other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand, I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts, I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up, probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room, OK, so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS, but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners, more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.There are a great many casino's in Vegas, if your trying to get away with counting, why would you go back to the same one (the Hardrock) again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were, in the end, kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence"
Righteous Kill             ,Smells_Like_Cheese,0,crime,2008,6,"Righteous Kill is one of those films that a lot of people have just been looking forward too because it has two of the greatest actors of our generation, Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. I must add how I love in a lot of the TV ad's they're saying this is their first film together, true, it's the first time they are real co-stars together, but they've had two films already. Anyways, back onto the film, Robert and Al are both incredible actors, we know that, Robert is actually my favorite actor, so naturally I was looking forward to seeing this movie, I hate to say this, oh, man, I hate to say this, but this film was an utter disappointment. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, but this was a sad and very predictable thriller that could have been done with more average actors, Al and Robert are above this script and don't pull in their best performances due to that. The story is very mediocre compared to some of these terrific actors who looked so bored throughout the move.Turk and Rooster are partners on the police force, having experienced over 30 years of constant bad guys going free, seeing the innocent's blood shed, and all the injustice in the world, they've almost lost it. Suddenly, there are murders involving the criminals they have arrested, along with younger officers, they try to figure out what is going on, but when one of the cops brings up that it might be a vigilante situation, Turk and Rooster are hesitant. Maybe they're hiding some secrets of their own.Righteous Kill, don't get me wrong, it's worth the look, especially to see these cinematic legends on screen together, but like I said, for the script they were given, this was way too average and they are above it. I even hate to say it, this was very predictable if you've seen a lot of these thriller movies of today. Not to mention, I think Al Pacino, this must have been his third movie where he has worn that same leather jacket, I mean is it just me, or does anyone else notice this? Over all, it's not a bad movie, but it could have just been done with average actors, instead of all the hype that has been around it because of the actors. Just don't be fooled, it's a typical thriller, nothing special, I suggest waiting for the rental.6/10 2"
Kisses             ,samzpan,1,drama,2010,NA,"Either the two teenagers who play the central roles are the greatest teen actors in the world OR the director can handle teenagers better than any director in the history of cinema. You should see this movie just for the superb job these two young people perform. The movie by itself is excellent, the photography, the use of the music of Bob Dylan, the dialog (thank you for the on screen translations cause at times it sounded like a foreign film from somewhere in Eastern Europe). This movie really is a gem as starts out in monotone and then when the kids reach Dublin the color is fantastic. I guess I just can't say enough nice things about this flick, check it out, you gotta love it."
Ponyo             ,QueenNadine,1,animation,2008,NA,"After the epic fairytale worlds of Howl's Moving Castle and (the underwhelming) Tales from Earthsea, Studio Ghibli's latest is a return to good old 80s Ghibli.The brainchild of Master Miyazaki himself, it lacks the elaborate plot of the likes of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away and makes do with far less characters. Instead we finally go back to seeing the world through the curious, wide-open eyes of a child.The story is based on Andersen's The Little Mermaid, but as the film progresses it becomes its own dreamlike vision. Ponyo is a 5-year old fish princess living in her family's underwater kingdom, and when she meets Sousuke, a boy of the same age, decides she wants to become human herself, much to her father's dismay.The underwater scenes are spectacular; as one would expect in a Miyazaki picture, they are full of strange, wonderful creatures that resemble something we may have seen in reality and yet are completely unique in their own right. During the initial sequence that's set in this colourful, mysteriously illuminated realm, the first point of comparison that came to my mind was the impressive ocean setting in Finding Nemo. However, where the Pixar film uses 3D graphics of all sorts to create stunningly realistic and impressive images, Ponyo uses a wide range of colours and shapes to create an equally, if not more, stunning fantasy kingdom. There is not a single CGI pixel anywhere in this film, yet the textures are lavishly rich, and the movements of light, the sea and its inhabitants incredibly fluent. The underwater scenes alone are a stunning artistic achievement.The rest of the film's visuals, however, impress just as much with their lovely but never kitschy pastel palette and the ever-loving detail that can be found in every single frame. The casual drawing style of Sousuke's house against the lavish green field in the background, the gorgeously peaceful town, or a glowing, golden moon are only a few examples of the many memorable images.Like in the now-20 year old classic, My Neighbour Totoro, the protagonists are young children, and a large part of the film's charm lies in their portrayal. Ever since I was a child and watched Heidi or Anne of Green Gables, (though I've only realised now), what's fascinated me about Miyazaki's animation is the accuracy in which it replicates children's movements, mimicry and mannerisms. Ponyo is a stubborn girl who, like any little princess, can get quite angry if not given what she wants ( though with more serious consequences than with most other children). And when she does, she behaves and moves in the exact same way that you see little kids do it every day in real life. 8-year old voice actress Nara Yuria also does a fantastic job in bringing Ponyo to life and making her the unbelievably lovable, cheeky little sh!t that she is. While she is delightfully hilarious in her half-fish, half-child shape that defies classification, Ponyo never becomes boring once she assumes her human shape. One of the most (literally) heartwarming moments of the film is when, as a human child, Ponyo tastes milk with honey for the first time, truly savouring the experience. The delighted expression on her little face reminded me of my own childhood firsts and gave me that warm fuzzy feeling in my chest. In many ways, Ponyo is very reminiscent of Mei in Totoro.Like Totoro, Ponyo also has a good old-fashioned opening sequence, and a title song you won't forget too soon after hearing it. Performed by little Ohashi Nozomi, the terribly catchy tune is a perfect sing-along for any child, young or old.And again, like its famous predecessor, some reviewers have noted (somewhat critically at times), that Ponyo is aimed at a much younger audience than the more recent Ghibli films. I'd like to phrase it differently and say that this is the first Ghibli in a while that doesn't exclude this target group completely. This film is of course for children, but (yes, as with Totoro) its merit lies in its many delights <U+0096> the lovingly precise portrayal of children's behaviour, the many moments of wonder and the sheer artistic vision.By the end of the fastest one-hundred minutes ever, I had that silly smile on my face, and I knew I'd once again witnessed true Miyazaki magic.Of course we'll have to see how well this one will hold up over repeated viewings and how it will be regarded in a decades time, but for now I'll say: Move over, Totoro.10/10. Now go see it!"
The Incredible Hulk             ,vithanks,0,action,2019,9,"Starting to watch Marvel movies in the shared universe in chronological order, I come across the fear of arriving in this movie and find it bad, but what I saw was a movie with a lot of action from beginning to end, good plot, good effects specials and good performances and filming in Brazi"
Shutter             ,ZiggyZane,0,horror,2008,1,"The attempt for this movie was a valiant one... but it failed none the less. They tried so hard to sum up J-Horror movies into one movie that didn't scare you, leave you in suspense, or even guessing. At one point I asked my girlfriend to wake me up when it got good. Had I actually gone to sleep and had her wake me up when it was good... she would've woken me up at the credits. The cinematography was great, but that was probably the only good thing about the movie. You see a side to Japan most movies don't show you, NOT the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but the side parks, the small houses outside the main cities, the apartments, etc. The movie left nothing to the imagination, you knew what was happening the entire time. There was no point in the movie where I was scared... I didn't even jump. All in all this movie was terrible, don't waste your money on it, watch something else instead... like moss growing, ANYTHING but this movie. "
The Reader             ,moutonbear25,1,drama,2009,8,"We don't know. We think we do but we don't. We make decisions or sometimes decisions are made for us but we think we've made them. Then suddenly, there we are. We can't be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry's THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he's ever been from himself?Of course, when you're a sixteen-year-old boy and a woman who looks like Kate Winslet disrobes in front of you in the privacy of her bathroom, how much thought really goes into the decision that has presented itself? However little it is, it is certainly less than is warranted. This is especially true in West Germany of 1958. This is a Germany that is uncertain how to proceed, how to be its new self in the eyes of the world and the eyes of its very own future generations. Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz, a compassionate woman but also abrasive and stern. Winslet strikes the perfect balance between directness and desire in Schmitz, making her complexities part of her appeal. She is a good fifteen years older than the young Berg and she knows much better than he of her country's history. What he knows, he has read in books, been taught in school. What she knows, she lived first hand. So when the two come together, naked in each other's arms, the meeting is as redemptive as it is passionate. Berg is just happy to be in love and having sex but Schmitz is washing herself clean with the youthful vigor of Germany's tomorrow.The summer ends and so does the affair, as one would expect. Just when it would seem that the two would never meet again, life steps in to ensure that past decisions, perhaps made in haste, can come to see their consequences. Berg has grown some and is a college man, studying to be a lawyer, when he catches sight of Hanna Schmitz again. Their latest chance encounter is far less exciting though as he sees her on a class outing to a courthouse. Schmitz is on trial for crimes against humanity for her time as an officer in the Nazi party during the Second World War. Berg's memory of his first love would now become a question of his own morality. How could he love someone who was now accused of such atrocities? How could he be so intimate with someone he apparently never truly knew? And yet, now that he knows her past, does he really know how her past came to be? After all, what is the face of evil? Is it Hanna Schmitz or is it something incredibly bigger than her?Ralph Fiennes is the future of Germany. He plays Berg as an adult. His life is orderly, very clean, crisp and cold. He made decisions that made him the man he is and he can never say whether they were the right ones or not. What he can see is that we all make decisions that either hurt or harm other people and that the atrocities committed by his past generations are not as far outside the realm of understanding as he might have originally thought. More importantly, redemption is not that far either."
Stop-Loss             ,evanston_dad,0,drama,2008,6,"Kimberly Peirce becomes one of the latest directors to try and only marginally succeed in making a compelling film about the Iraq conflict.Peirce takes on as her subject the military's stop-loss clause, essentially a back door draft by which the military can use fine print in recruits' contracts to prevent them from getting out once their time is up. Peirce obviously feels strongly about the policy, but what should be a hard-hitting drama feels instead like a rather preachy after-school special. She coaxes a nice performance out of Ryan Phillipe, as the soldier who goes AWOL when his stop-loss clause is activated, but she doesn't fare as well with the rest of the cast. The film suffers from confusing editing, that doesn't always make it clear where characters are or how events are related to one another, and the writing at times is weak as well, with character motivations not coming across as clearly as they should.I don't know what it is about the Iraq conflict that makes it so hard for filmmakers to make good movies about it. Maybe it will have to be over for a while before anyone can begin to approach it with any success.Grade: B-"
Forgetting Sarah Marshall             ,roset3678,1,comedy,2008,8,"I'm going to be honest, walking into the advanced screening tonight I was expecting an overly chick flicky somewhat dull comedy. What I got instead was a pretty hilarious movie with just the right amount of romance and a whole lot of vulgar comedy also. I can honestly say this is the funniest movie of 2008 so far. The entire Judd Apatow crew has overall had about 4 or five great comedies in the last 3 years, putting them up with all the other great comedy film makers since 2005. This movie makes me feel like I can now trust any movie they make most the time. When this movie hits theatres in April, GO SEE IT. I promise you won't find a funnier movie out any time soon. 1"
Shutter             ,Coventry,0,horror,2008,4,"Unfortunately I didn't manage to catch the 2004 Thai original before this American remake premiered at the annual Belgian Horror and Fantasy Festival. I didn't bother to see it when it initially got released because there already was an overload of Asian Ghost movies at that time and I really couldn't cope enduring another dull and scare-free imitation of ""Ringu"". After seeing the US remake I'm definitely interested in checking out the original sooner or later. The basic idea of restless spirits trying to communicate through photography is remotely original, but the elaboration (at least in this remake) remains somewhat tedious and predictable. Immediately after their marriage, Jane follows her photographer husband Ben to Tokyo where his friends arranged a splendid job for him. Jane, but soon after also Ben, suffers from visions of a deceased girl and all the pictures they make are ruined by ghostly images of this same girl. There's more than obviously a link between this girl and Ben's past days as a bachelor, but Jane only gradually learns the truth of what happened exactly. To my knowledge, this is the first and so far only Thai film to be remade by a Japanese director but with American funds and cast members. Talk about an international co-production! Masayuki Ochiai previously directed the incredibly atmospheric and uncanny hospital-horror film ""Infection"", so he definitely knows how to build up suspense and terror through suggestion. The main problem here is that the ghostly subject matter is too ""soft"" and doesn't lend itself to provide some genuine shock-moments. We've all seen too many (Asian) horror movies already in which white-faced spirits spontaneously appear & disappear again, and the mystery is always build up towards a point where the script can't possibly fulfill the audience's anticipations anymore. In ""Shutter"", you rather quickly figure out that Ben knows than he tells, so you can easily guess each and every plot twist far in advance. There are a very limited number of sets and exterior locations. Why didn't the film take advantage of the wondrous city of Tokyo, like for example ""Lost in Translation"" did? Rachael Taylor is certainly a promising actress with a lot of growing potential, so I hope she'll get offered a couple of better screenplays in the near future. Thus far, she only has horror rubbish like ""See No Evil"" and ""Man-Thing"" on her repertoire and those things won't get her noticed. Neither will ""Shutter"", for that matter"
One Missed Call             ,texrangers31,0,horror,2008,2,"I am a fan or horror movies. I get scared by almost anything, and I will admit that once I read the plot summary for 'One Missed Call' I was intrigued. My friend and I both thought it had potential. Than I saw the trailer, and was almost as disappointed as I was I saw 'The Land Before Time 16'. I went to see this movie expecting it to be comically ridiculous, and I wasn't disappointed. If you want a good laugh, go see it. If you are frightened by a missed call on your cell phone than you may want to sleep with the lights on, otherwise you should be fine. The worst part about this movie is that it isn't quite corny enough to be considered entertaining. It simply leaves you constantly turning to the person next to you to say ""What was that?"" because of how childish the plot becomes. "
Good Dick             ,babyg8878,1,misc,2010,10,"I am truly, truly thankful for this movie. It actually helped me see that some of my more bizarre behaviors can be traced back to my own experiences with sexual abuse. Somehow this film made me feel less alone and more alone simultaneously. Less alone because its existence means that at least one person (the writer) truly understands. More alone because though the pure, unconditional love offered up is exquisitely beautiful, it is extremely rare and I doubt seriously it will ever be offered to me. Except by God, of course. Great film. It illustrates one of the main reasons why I would love to be a filmmaker. Movies can and do reach people, and in some instances, help."
Four Christmases             ,marcbudgell717,1,comedy,2008,2,"Where to begin on this one. I didn't really have high hopes for this one, as the commercial made it look really boring, but I got forced into going. I figured hey, Vince Vaughn is awesome, he will probably make it bearable. Yeah, he didn't.For starters, he and Reese Witherspoon have no chemistry. Their relationship is annoying and they aren't likable characters who you can cheer for. The whole movie is packed with big name actors, but there isn't a single one who is likable, and it makes it really difficult to care as the movie drags on.Finally, the most painful part was when they let Vince Vaughn just talk incessantly, especially in the later stages of the movie. I loved his rambling style in other movies, but in this one I just want to reach out and slap him.Avoid, there really isn't anything good about this movie."
Stop-Loss             ,badajoz-1,0,drama,2010,6,"This film is never going to make money in the USA because all films and politicians have to make Amnericans feel good about themselves. This leaves one with the queasy feeling that not all is well - the US might not be doing the best thing by the Iraqis, after all whose country is it? Who invaded whom? And under what pretext? But the film is in favour of all those guys fighting on the ground, but they may be fighting the wrong war in the wrong place - and to conservative US that is not acceptable. So this film divides opinion. 'Hurt Locker' of course portrays US heroes so is going to be far more acceptable. The film has a fifties/forties feel in that a decent man makes one mistake, and becomes a fugitive. Montgomery Clift would have made this then. The film portrays a good man caught by duty and his own feelings of justice - a classic theme - well played by Ryan Phillippe, who does manage to show a good range of emotions, and who doesn't get the comfort of getting the girl into the sack - that was left for real life! The script shows the strain of loyalties and the effects of killing in a war that the West brought down upon a largely civilian population - sounds like Concord and 1776 to me! The supports act well and do not drown out the main action and character. But the film has a problem in that the spur for the action is played down too much - eg Brandon King refusing to be 'stop lossed' - and it does not want to make events too dramatic (something the more visceral 'Hurt Locker' engages). Therefore, the film tends to meander as it tries to be too understated. But it does get in several wry observations about an immigrant army, a creepy, smiling officer class, and promise all politicians. A good effort, but ultimately it gets caught between too many stools. A pity because the acting deserved more recognition than being tarred by the rabid, blind patriotism of Americans who see an anti-war and anti-US fil"
Nim's Island             ,simnia-1,1,adventure,2008,3,"Something about the style of this movie totally grated on my sense of taste right from the start. The misleading movie poster showed a wooden pirate ship, but what the audience gets is a modern cruise ship full of very overweight, aged tourists: a slight difference there (sarcasm intended), and no chance for any eye candy. Both the pet lizard and pet pelican of the girl squawked like parrots, which was ridiculous and was of course just done by a human voice faking a parrot to make it even worse. The story was totally predictable: woman writer overcomes her agoraphobia and rescues the little girl in distress, single father becomes enamored with the lady at the end, there is the obligatory collection of animals and one fart joke for the child audience, the father finds exactly the plankton he has been looking for, the pouty little girl has a change of heart and helps out the lady at the end, and so on. It looked as if the story was intended to be humorous, but it wasn't, especially the treadmill scene, which by unfortunate coincidence was the same gag used in an animated trailer before this movie began, which destroyed the novelty. The acting was horribly unrealistic everywhere: the overly enthusiastic kid, the overly wonderful father, the overly phobic writer. The intro and ending scenes with the cheap cardboard cutouts with CGI scenery were ugly, weird, and perplexing: that all comes across as a money-saving device, looking like the filmmakers were too cheap to film a real woman on a real boat to tell the background history. Too much of the film was so far-fetched: that through all the girl's falls her pet lizard would never get squashed, that nobody would wonder how lizards could fly fifty feet through the air to land on the beach, how a volcano could start erupting but then conveniently stop in time for the family get-together at the end, why an antenna underwater would be accompanied by gurgling audio sounds, why the sailor father would not realize a storm was hitting as soon as it started to rain, why they wouldn't have storm shutters on their house, that a woman in modern times would be swallowed by a whale, that a pelican could carry an entire loaded tool belt for miles across the ocean, and so on. The CGI turtle underwater looked fake, as did the three CGI circling sharks. The excessive political correctness (most people won't notice where this occurred, and I'm not going to enlighten you) was appalling to me, as well. And what's with the girl eating a plate of live worms? An island like that would have plentiful fish within easy reach, so that intentional gross-out meal was ridiculously unrealistic, especially that the worms were uncooked and still squirming. And why didn't the filmmakers take the trouble to do a ghostly fade-out of the presence of the adventurer who kept talking to the author in her imagination, instead of having him swim off in order to get him out of the scene? That seemed to show additional laziness or cheapness on the filmmakers' part. I was annoyed with this film from the very start: I kept wondering why I wasn't enjoying it and I kept telling myself it had to get better or more interesting, but it never did.What makes this all so surprising is that all the backgrounds and themes should have been great: the wonderful setting on a tropical island, a paradisiacal hideaway on the island, the oceanographer mother and father, the perfect childhood with several exotic pets and no school, pirates, nice decor with coral and hanging shells, and so on. To take such an appealing foundation and still ruin the movie takes some real skill. Awful!"
Street Kings             ,mercy740,,misc,2008,10,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie; the cop genre is not my favorite after all, but I did. I really did. It does feel like a B movie or sort of film noir, perhaps because it only cost 20 million to make. But the cast was top notch. As much as I love Keanu Reeves, I always go into any movie of his cringing, ""Will he do well? Will he survive this?"" And Reeves delivers with aplomb. This is easily his most nuanced role to date - he truly wears the weight of a cop who has seen and done too much on his face. The action scenes were kick ass and I loved to see Amaury Nolasco play against his Prison Break type. All the actors were great, though I thought Forest Whitaker was a little OTT. "
The Baader Meinhof Complex             ,samantha-bird2,1,misc,2008,8,"Let me start by saying that, before this title, I have not yet studied/or read any content relating to the RAF (in school or otherwise) so I can merely comment on the films content itself.The film starts with a protest against the war which is the main element to the rest of the feature. This scene details in an exquisite manner just why these teenagers decided to rebel and protest against the government. They commit bank robberies and bombings ""for the cause"" and they are soon seen as terrorists by the government. It is then that it starts to go horrible wrong for the RAF as they are then shot point blank by police and are fighting to remain out of prison.Their plans and thoughts were not (intentionally) bad, there fight against oppression is a compelling one and Uli Edel portrays this magnificently. I had originally been a bit sceptical about this feature but I was gripped throughout. Johanna Wokalek was outstanding as Gudrun Ensslin.I felt the plot was entertaining and well written. The story is portrayed mostly from the ""terrorists"" side and is made to make them look like the good guys over the government but that is what I think makes this film. You side with the terrorists and hope that it is there cause that will win.In the end, the film portrays how a cause that can be seen as timid has been blown out of proportion and turned into something it was never intended to be. The 2nd and 3rd generation RAF, seem to fight for a different cause.There were of course some negative points about this movie. I am going to be typically British and say there was far too much nudity for such a serious portrayal. But it was quite entertaining when the arrogant Baader says: ""Shooting is like f*****g!"" at the army camp.The main point of why I would not give this film ten stars is the 2nd and 3rd generation RAF members. Once the prison element has been put into the film it is as if the main point has been lost. Although it is intriguing to see the views of the 2nd generation, these characters (apart from one) are not in it very long so the viewers are not able to relate to the characters.All in all I would say that I cannot wait for this title to be on DVD and will be doing more research into the RAF now. It also makes me quite glad that I did not experience any of this first hand. If you are from the UK, then this is one subtitled movie that I would highly recommend watchin"

The Weatherman and The Island were both so bad that I thought about it but I even stayed to the end in those. This movie was incomprehensible, not funny and just went on and on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if parts were just French humor that I didn't get or if the characters were serious. I finally just gave up and tried napping because I didn't want to disturb my husband if he was enjoying it but he noticed and let me know that it was OKAY if I wanted to leave and out the door we went.

Gran Torino             ,Kevin-42,0,drama,2008,NA,"Gran Torino - They don't make them like they used to....Mr. Eastwood has a knack for storytelling. Instead of being preachy or having an all to obvious agenda, he lets his viewers make up their own minds. His characters don't have a message, they have a life and make no excuses for who they are. In so many subtle and intelligent ways we are allowed to make our own choices. Like with Kowalski in the movie, you are not confronted with a role model hammering home all those ""life's important messages"", but rather with a movie saying ""Look! This is the way it worked out for me. And I think I know a few tricks that might help you, but in the end it's your own life. However, you have to trust me when I say that there are a some things you don't want to see or experience!"". Some people will leave this movie entirely untouched, others will certainly be crying their guts out. Not because some people ""get it"" and others ""don't"", but because it is a brilliant piece of entertainment reaching out to every viewer in its own specific way.Eastwood's acting is top notch again, although the years have not been very kind to his voice. The rest of the cast are fine, but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here and there which is the main reason why I could not give this one a 10/10.Apart from that there is little to criticize. It's not an action movie, not a drama movie and certainly not a comedy (even though you get a few laughs out of this one). It's simply a good story about life.....and death. 2"
Four Christmases             ,ferguson-6,1,comedy,2008,6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Vince Vaughn is starting to remind me of what Woody Allen went through ... ""I liked his funny movies"". Just wasn't a fan of ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""The Break-up"", but I certainly recognize his comedic talents. Here, his quirks play a little better, though I never really bought off on he and Reece Witherspoon as a couple.Low expectations, a strong cast, a few clever lines, easily relatable family strain, and a true sight ""gag"" make this one enjoyable enough. The trailer gives away the set-up of the film as Reece and Vince are forced to visit all four pieces of their disjointed families on Christmas. For some reason, director Seth Gordon (""King of Kong"") casts Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek as VV's parents and Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen as Reece's. The curiosity stems from the age difference between these actors ... a 15-16 year span. Just struck me as odd. Though not quite as odd as Jon Voight offering parental advice. Now THAT is comedy! Despite the hi-jinx, the messages abound: we all have the weirdest family, it is never easy to really connect with another person, and it's always a good time for cheese whiz. This is really VV's film as Reece has little to offer save for the bounce bounce scene. Mr. Vaughn is truly at his best in the moments of rapid fire dialogue as he helplessly tries to avoid another ridiculous situation.One warning to parents: the film is rated PG-13 and there is a segment regarding the Santa secret, so be forewarned. The unwritten rule is broken. The quick lines and uncomfortable family moments make this one worth a few giggles. Not a Christmas classic, but a decent comedy.I must mention the tribute to the classic ""A Christmas Story"" as the kids peer into the toy store window early on. That scene is followed by the airport scene, where the ticket agent is played by none other than Peter Billingsley, a grown up Ralphie from that movie (and producer of this film)."
Wendy and Lucy             ,in1984,1,drama,2009,6,"As much as I think this film is both memorable and worth seeing, there were a few too many missing elements and underdeveloped story parts. In some ways, it ends up coming off as the ""don't leave home"" version of a ""don't do drugs"" film for teens.The biggest complement I can give this film is that the realism of views, and in some cases beauty, sticks with you. That has to do almost entirely because of how well it's filmed, the imagery it captures. To the actors' credit, everyone is believable and there are no cliché characters.Another interesting aspect of the film is the soundtrack - or essentially the lack thereof. It's integrated into the film, fits the mood of the story, and very memorable."
Step Up 2: The Streets             ,antidonnie,0,misc,2008,7,"""It's Not Where You're From. It's Where You're At.""Considering the fact that I haven't see the first one (nor do I want to) I really have nothing else to compare this movie too, and because of this it stands alone. Step Up 2 the Streets brings not only the best dancing I have ever seen on screen (aside from White Nights I guess), but what it does is it proves that even with a moderate script you can still present something remarkable with the right kind of characters and good pacing.The whole concept about following you're heart is a load of bull and has been done many times before, but it was, however, never mentioned in the film, which I was very pleased about. To a reasonable extent, I enjoyed most of the characters and the talented actors that really developed their characters. I can imagine it being extremely difficult to finds actors that can not only act but have incredible dancing abilities. It's because of their talent that I can over look the fact that a lot of them look older than their character's age.What I mean about good pacing is that because I watched this movie at three o'clock in the morning I never once felt that something felt out of place or that this was more dancing than story, or vice versa. I was kind of tired and if any film can keep me up long enough to watch the whole thing, then it will have my praise. WARNING SPOILERS ( FROM ANOTHER MOVIE)I remember the first time I watched Jeepers Creepers, which I watched around the same time as this film. I was about half way through when the monster was finally in the open, and it turned out to be some indestructible monster with wings. It was after that that I decided to stop the movie at wait until morning to finish the movie. I didn't have that problem with Step Up 2 the Streets.I give it too the critics that the ending was it's weakest point and had the potential to conclude with a better punch, but that wasn't a big problem because I found that I didn't want the end too come because I was so in to the story of these characters and the fantastic variety of dancing.I would just recommend to watch this movie with an open mind. Try not to right away hate or love anything about it until the movie ends, and then ask yourself, ""was this movie worth watching?""***/**** StarsStep Up 2 the Streets (2008) Rated PG-13 for suggestive material and brief violen"
The Brothers Bloom             ,NoArrow,1,action,2009,6,"""The Brothers Bloom"" is a movie stock full of great ideas that it executes without any apparent knowledge of what makes a movie work. It's filmed in some of the most beautiful places in the world and captures them blandly. It's step-by-step full of great con-games that we don't care about. It's got one of the most interesting heroines in years that it ultimately leaves to the side, unaware of how to use her. It's constantly suggesting great artists (Melville, Dostoevsky) and it's opening act - a Ricky Jay-narrated history of the Brothers Bloom's humble beginnings - promises greatness. But the movie doesn't deliver.The story: Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody started conning as children, and never stopped, and now, as adults, they're locked together like the siblings in ""Les Enfants Terribles,"" only capable of inhabiting their own world of deception and whimsy. Ruffalo's the head and likes it that way and Brody's the heart and wants out, wants to find happiness somewhere else, in the ""unwritten life."" Ruffalo sets up One Last Job for the two of them, and the mark is Rachel Weisz (the heroine), a reclusive millionaire and collector of hobbies. As this is a con-movie, any further explanation is unnecessary.Rian Johnson, the film's director and director of ""Brick,"" has fine taste, as he flaunts constantly, but his movies are an argument that good taste does not a great artist make. Like the lowliest imitator, he wants to do something like his favorites, but he hasn't put much thought into why those movies worked on him. ""The Big Sleep"" has the period dialogue, the shadows and all that, but it's great because of the chemistry, the mood, what's happening under the surface. ""Brick"" has no mood, it's all surface, all words and cinematography, a truly empty film. With ""The Brothers Bloom,"" Johnson is trying to make ""The Sting"" by way of Wes Anderson, the French New Wave (and a little David Mamet), but mostly misses the comedy of Anderson, the style of the New Wave and doesn't even come close to the metaphysical suspense of a Mamet film.For instance: Ruffalo has a sidekick/girlfriend played by Rinko Kikuchi. Her name is ""Bang Bang"" because she likes explosives, and she doesn't speak a single line of dialogue. This alone is gimmicky enough, an easy way of forging a Character without thinking for a second who she might be. The movie explains she just up and appeared to the Brothers one day, and will disappear, one day, in the same fashion. So she's an almost supernatural character, I guess, but to what purpose? Quirkiness? Kikuchi eats up the attention in any scene she's in, simply because we want to know more about her, but Johnson insults her and the audience by keeping her a prop, like the hamburger phone in ""Juno."" In one Emotional Montage at the end, she sings, which would be a great moment in a better movie but here is handled so off-the-cuff and casually we just sort of shrug it off. A couple short scenes later she disappears into thin air in front of Brody, so we think, that was it? And then she pops up again, to do nothing, and disappears again. Johnson doesn't seem to be thinking at all.But he might fool you. The dialogue is finely-honed, but too much so, it becomes awkward, clunky, speaking to ideas Johnson hasn't completed rather than ones the characters are having spontaneously. The movie really, really wants to be as dialogue-driven as a Mamet movie but falls short in its excess of artifice and complete lack of wit. That said, Brody, Weisz and Ruffalo create likable characters simply by appearing on screen; they're all such great actors we're almost happy enough just to watch them have some fun. Weisz especially, her eccentric is so convincing at times it makes the movie's shortchanging her so much more troubling. Her character is built up to have a mystery about her, something intriguing seems to lie beneath the surface, but as it goes on we sadly realize that's more to do with Weisz's skill and less to do with Johnson's writing.The plot keeps going and going and going, the movie feels twice as long as ""The Dark Knight"" and about a quarter as interesting. There's a con, and then there's another con, and then another, and they're all pretty well thought-out except that the outcomes don't mean anything to us because Johnson hasn't spent enough time figuring out who his characters are, and what we want for them. Brody is frustratingly ineffectual, and Ruffalo convinces us he knows all the answers, he just never tells us what they are. Robbie Coltrane and Maximilian Schell pop up, Schell with an eye-patch and a drama-class-level costume, and do nothing.And then there's the last revelation, and the ending, which could've been beautiful and poignant, if only Johnson had any idea how to take us there. He doesn't. His head's in the right place, he just needs to use it more, and  most importantly  discover his heart. Not a bad movie, just not one worth seeing.6/10"
Righteous Kill             ,gregmovies,0,crime,2008,7,"This film has a lot of problem, but the great performances of its stars still make it worth seeing at the theater. The twist was way too predictable (I had it solved half an hour in, and I'm usually unable to figure out twists way ahead of time) and the script wasn't very impressive. The direction is OK, but nothing special. There were some pretty funny moments and one liners though. The only thing that makes this better than a sub-par thriller is De Niro and Pacino, both of whom put in great performances and really save this movie. The supporting actors do just fine, but are overshadowed. I was really anxious for a movie in which the pair finally share some significant screen time together, and this movie was about as good as could be expected, considering the makers of the film.It isn't the best movie out right now (try Burn After Reading), but I do recommend going to see this one. I give it 7/10. I hope Robert De Niro and Al Pacino team up again, hopefully with a better screenplay and director."
Twilight             ,Littlechicky_hotstuff,1,misc,2008,3,"Okay, I just got back from watching ""Twilight"" and I must say, cheesiest, choppiest, worst characterization of a movie I have seen in years and by far the worst Book adaptation I've ever seen! It even beat my discontentment with Ella Enchanted.As avid readers, we do not go to a movie to see ""surprises"" or script changes! We go to the movie to see our favorite books displayed out in front of us to see how our minds and visuals compare. Bella was suppose to be funny, she was way too bloody serious! Kristen go get some facial expressions, terror is not love and looking insensitive all the time is not what the character Bella is all about! She's so clumsy it's funny, she's sarcastic, you took out ALL of my favorite lines! And their should have been more chemistry between Jacob and Bella, it's like hey look their vamps, haha now you can leave. She's comical, did you even read the book? Edward, don't' look so constipated all the time. Like jeez you're suppose to be tense, not looking like you had too much carbohydrates and not enough water. Not only that you didn't' portray Edward's genuine gentleman side at all, the loving chivalrous side! And where is that infamous half smile! Honestly i'll make a list for all of your characters! An essay about each and everyone on how readers want them portrayed and what scenes we could do with out.Alice was awesome, Jasper, very nice! Rosalie, hell down pat! Emmet, please face baseball cap forward, it's annoying. actually don't wear hats, Emmet's not wangster and you look hot without it. Carlisle please cause some more fatherly emotion but good! Esme, you do alright. One question plagues me though... WHY WEREN""T THEY GIVEN MORE LINES? Like jeez! I understand your need to save time because no one wants to sit through a six hour movie but if it had to be three and a half hours, we'd enjoy it! Jacob Black, awesome casting!!!! But give him more lines, I saw Tyler Lautner in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, he's a really good actor, ACTUALLY why don't you JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK!! Come on everyone loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I read those books and especially in Harry Potter didn't' have any troubles with their movie adaptations, actually i didn't realized when they changed something! OK maybe some chapters were taken out but it didn't ruin the overall point and it was funny loving and mischievous. I loved those books and those movies. The chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking. I actually didn't care to get up and go bathroom in between, i pretty much didn't' care to miss any of it. THIS IS A POPULAR BOOK! You're adaptation sucked major insignificant crap. I mean just look at your movie rating! For a book that beat Harry Potter's final book, I mean best seller's list and it was Eclipse the second last book of the series and it beat out the final book to HARRY POTTER. Couldn't you have taken a little more time on it. And where was Alice and Jasper and Rosalie and Emmet at the end in the prom scene? I honestly do not care if you continue on with the movies, actually I'd prefer it if you didn't. You have ruined my vision of it, you're killing your fan base. Unless you guys give the next one some extra spark and actually start listening to your fans, you can forget about a wide fan base. I absolutely hated the movie. I felt sorry for those who didn't read the books because they had NO CLUE what was going on it was so choppy!!! I couldn't even tell when the next day started, all of a sudden, Edward ""I would like you to meet my family"" next two minutes, ""wow you have a really nice house..."" um... hello did she sleep? DID I FALL ASLEEP? I think i missed something, oh no wait, you did. It's called nightfall. Where was the talk about twilight? How it is the beginning and ending of a day...? Or about her talking in her sleep. He looked like a weird serial killer stalking her in her sleep. WHERE WERE THE FUNNY PARTS! I had more fun and made my friends laugh by making my own commentary during the film, i even made people i didn't know who sat in front of me in the theater burst out laughing from my commentary then your boring movie did.As readers we expect the book to be taken seriously, and adapted to screen, NOT BASED, ADAPTED!!!!!! I've taken Communication Production Tech class in my high school writing my own scripts, so I know script writing agony, i'm also writing my own book. So if i was to ever sign off my book to make it a screen version I'd make darn sure it took more than a few SLOPPY months to make, with a CAST WHO READ THE BOOK FIRST AND RESEARCHED THEIR CHARACTER! Honestly, can you seriously give me an answer about how many cast members actually, i mean truly read all the books? I'm sure hardly any of them did.This by far is the biggest disappointment I have seen in years and I'm only eighteen.ADAPTION IS NOT THE SAME AS BASED ON!!! PEOPLE HONESTLY! Anyone who says they loved the movie did not care much for the characters or shares the same love as Stephenie Meyer does for her books. This was rushed, unorganized, ill plan, deceitful, and horrid.You're lacking the spunk, zest, fire, passion, integrity, and the complete ethics of what made the TWILIGHT SERIES! 2"
The Tale of Despereaux             ,spinatai,0,animation,2008,9,"I can't say I was expecting much before going to this film: I hadn't heard anything about it prior entering the cinema, and the fact that it was an animation didn't appeal to me. I went to see it just because my little sister wanted to watch it very much, so I really didn't have much choice.Firstly, the colours and the overall atmosphere of the movie was something unusual. The film can be divided into three parts: happy beginning, dismal middle, and of course, the happy ending. The feel and atmosphere of every part is enhanced by the change of colours: bright, warm colours dominate the beginning and the end of the animation, while faded and cold colours dominate the middle.Secondly, I enjoyed how three different types of society were reflected. The first and most apparent would be the Kingdom of Dor, suffering from an incompetent ruler who puts his emotions first, while the interests of the kingdom are second. The second type would be the Ratworld, a consumerist, primitive society, which is ruled on the basis of ""the leader is he who provides food and entertainment"". The last type is the Mouseworld, a society governed by fear of rule-breaking, emphasising the importance of ""fitting-in"".Although I liked the middle part of the movie (the gloomy one), I was wondering, if it was appropriate for children, as it brought up such issues as revenge, abolishment of one's principles, treachery. I doubt if kids can make the correct interpretations (or conclusions), so explaining or talking to them after the movie would be reasonable.The ending was typical of fairy tales: everyone (except for the bad guys) is fine and lives happily ever after (?).In all, the movie exceeded my expectations. The moral issues brought up, the atmosphere, the unusual development of the story, the happy ending- everything was delivered in a nice way, the only thing that made the movie lose a star (9/10) is the doubt that children would fully understand it.In all, in all, a nice watch :)"
Pathology             ,kevin_crighton,1,crime,2008,8,"When brilliant Doctor Ted Grey gets a job working in a University Pathology lab, he falls in with a group of young brilliant doctors led by Doctor Jake Gallo. Grey discovers that the others are playing a game where one doctor kills a person and the others have to work out how it was done. As Grey gets caught up in this, can he find a way out, or is he in too deep....Pathology is written by Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor. They wrote the insane and fun action movie CRANK. This movie while not as funny as Crank is still insane! The plot is quite daft, and it has to be said full of plot-holes. This could be the result of scenes being cut from the movie, but this didn't bother me at all.Simply put, this movie was fun.The cast led by Milo Ventimiglia as Grey and Michael Weston as Gallo are all good. The direction by Marc Schoelermann keeps things moving at a brisk pace. As befits a movie about Pathology doctors, it is quite gory and bloody, but it is never over the top.Although not a movie that will win many awards, for it's running time, it is very enjoyable and worth watching if you don't take it seriously. One thing though... it may put you off doctors for life!! "
The Merry Gentleman             ,TxMike,,crime,2010,NA,"As the movie opens we see a brief scene of a man and woman in the bedroom, and it is clear that he has some anger issues, and at least this time, probably not the first, he has hit her. Then we see her packing some things and leaving. He will eventually track her down, after a long time, and this plays into the overall thrust of the story.Kelly Macdonald is the young woman, Kate Frazier. She starts a new life, a new job, and a new small apartment. Seems everyone asks about where she got the black eye, and each explanation is different.It is nearing Christmastime, and as she exits work one evening looks up at the snow and sees a man standing on the edge of the top of the building across the street. Frightened for him she yells, and he jumps to safety on the roof. She doesn't think too much of it until the police come to talk to her, someone in her building had been shot about that time (we actually see the hit, he called the man's phone to get him at the right place for a clean shot) and they suspected it might have been the same man she saw (it was).Michael Keaton is Frank Logan, who works as a tailor in an upscale shop, but his main occupation is contract hit man. He had seen Kate that night through his rifle scope, perhaps was touched that she called to him, and unknown to her he looked her up. They actually met when she had fallen at the entrance to her building and was trapped under her too-big Christmas tree. He helped her and soon they became good friends. His skill serves well when Kate's abusive husband finally tracks her down.This isn't a very savory topic, but overall Keaton and Macdonald make this a drama a cut above most.

The Dark Knight             ,ddeppfan21,0,action,2008,10,"I just saw The Dark Knight and it was even better than I expected and I expected it to be great. Most of this comment is about Heath Ledger so let me start by giving Christian Bale and the rest of the awesome cast, director,make-up,special effects team, writers, producers, and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in, and on this movie.Now for Ledger. People can say what they want about Heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it just isn't true. Alive or gone, this was the performance of a lifetime. The make-up, the laugh, the mannerisms, every little thing he did was perfect. I have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. I love Jack Nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive, but I am sorry Jack because Heath Ledger just out shined you and that is not easy to do.I was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have just been too symbolic and I would have lost it. I did cry at the end though. The ending when two face, the commissioner and batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled Heath Ledger's untimely passing.It is completely unfair that Heath's family and the world are going to miss out on such an amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent I have ever seen. I am a single mother and I can't even begin to imagine losing my daughter, so my heart goes out to Heath's family and his daughter. I am truly sorry that such an amazing man died so young.Dahr Prince "
Righteous Kill             ,bkoganbing,0,crime,2008,6,"When Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro teamed for the first time in Heat the main complaint from fans was that there was not enough screen time for them together. In fact the one scene in that film that had them together was shoe horned into the film. It had to be because in that one the two were on opposite sides of the law.No problem on that score here because in Righteous Kill, Pacino and DeNiro play a pair of veteran police detectives who take the job very seriously indeed. What they're working on now is as the leads in team that is tracking down a serial killer who likes to leave little poetical epitaphs behind for each victim.The plot here is borrowed from Magnum Force, but in that film, Hal Holbrook has recruited a personal death squad from among the young officers of the San Francisco PD. and Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is trying to solve the case. When these guys do figure it out that it's a cop doing the killing, it's one individual however doing it on their own.This is not a harmonious team that Lieutenant Brian Dennehy has put together. Carla Gugino is trying to show she's as tough as the men and a couple of younger detectives, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg are wanting bad to show up the older Pacino and DeNiro. Righteous Kill is pure gold when the two acting legends are on the screen together. When the attention is not on them however, the story does drag a bit in spots. In fact the very lack of forensic clues at the crime scenes should have alerted this team as to where to look for the killer. Still no opportunity to see Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro for the price of one ticket should be misse"
Goodbye Solo             ,Turfseer,0,drama,2010,4,"Set in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 'Goodbye Solo' is about a happy-go-lucky taxicab driver from Senegal who one night picks up a passenger who offers him $1,000 to drive to a secluded site in a state park on a date about two weeks in the future. The driver ends up inviting the man to briefly stay over at his house, where his pregnant wife and stepdaughter are living. In the real world, I can't imagine any dutiful husband, allowing a total stranger into his house, as the new found guest could easily turn out to be some kind of criminal who might do harm to the family.Once you're willing to suspend your disbelief over the cab driver's willingness to trust a passenger he knows virtually nothing about, 'Goodbye Solo' draws you in as it chronicles the relationship between the cab driver and the enigmatic passenger. The passenger is played by a great character actor, Red West. In real life, he was part of the 'Memphis Mafia', working as a bodyguard for Elvis Presley for many years and later collaborating on a tell-all biography. West is about 74 years old now and has great, tough-guy, weather beaten looks along with a deep, menacing voice.The plot follows the driver Solo (breezily played by Souleymane Sy Savane) as he attempts to befriend the belligerent William. Before the climactic trip to William's final destination, Solo drives William to the same movie theater on a number of occasions; there, Solo notices William taking an interest in a young man behind the ticket counter. When Solo asks William if the young man is his son or someone related, William angrily lashes out, stating that it's none of his business. The angry mantra is repeated ad infinitum but Solo cannot take the hint. Finally, after prying one too many times, William slugs Solo in the face and tells him he doesn't ever want to see him again. Through his persistence, Solo manages to force a reconciliation and convinces William to allow him to bring his stepdaughter with him as he drives William to his fateful, final destination.There are moments when Solo appears to be making headway in breaking down William's resistance to softening up. William appears to take a liking to the stepdaughter (at least that's what he indicates in a notebook which Solo gets his hands on and briefly flips through) and seems to enjoy playing pool with Solo. But William's 'senstive' side is rarely on display. It's obvious at the end of the movie that William wants to end his life but we never find out why. The film's scenarist has been teasing us as to William's motivations and only provides scant clues (such as an entry in the notebook that the young man at the movie theater is his son).The problem with 'Goodbye Solo' is that there's no payoff. William disappears (presumably having jumped off a mountain) and we know about as much about him as we did when we first met him. The sub-plots (Solo's attempt to become a flight attendant and his estrangement and eventual reconciliation with his wife) are mere distractions. The central mystery, who is William and why is he trying to kill himself, is never answered.Today, there are too many films where screenwriters don't know how come up with a satisfactory ending. For all its good intentions, Goodbye Solo fits into this category. Despite the intriguing storyline and excellent performances, Solo runs out of gas right at the finish line."

The Women             ,arichmondfwc,1,comedy,2008,6,"It was an impossible task to update a classic that was embedded in its time and as such could travel the waves of time intact because we could adapt to its historical context. Now this 2008 version seems the one that's dated. I used to love Meg Ryan, reminded me of Carol Lombard now she's more like Joan Rivers, in appearance if not in spirit. There is nothing funny about her. Strangely enough she looks better in the second part of the film. In any case, the modernity of Norma Shearer's performance is unbeatable. Annette Bening is better but couldn't cancel the memory of Rosalind Russell, who could? If one can divorce oneself from the George Cukor original, and one must to be able to sit through it, there are a few pleasures to be had, mostly thanks to Cloris Leachman, Candice Bergen (playing Meg Ryan's mom for the second time, remember ""Rich and Famous""?) and Bette Midler in a much to brief stint playing the part once played by Mary Boland. The most unforgivable blunder is Eva Mendes's Crystal. She couldn't fill Joan Crawford's shoes not even by mistake. Her performance is vulgar, jarring and ugly. How strange that someone as smart as Diane English could give us such a confusing picture of women. Oh well, I had to see it, I saw it and I'm very disappointed but hardly surprised. 1"
Igor             ,garfield2710,0,animation,2010,6,"After watching ""Igor"" I didn't know what to think. It seemed a little dark to be a children's film and delivery was late. However, after I gave it some thought, I realized I liked the film better than I first thought. This movie, while not brilliant, is actually kind of fun. This is one of the few attempts to make a children's dark comedy, probably because kids wouldn't understand the things played for comedy should never be done in real life. Take Scamper, for example. He is an immortal, who doesn't want to be immortal. So he tries to kill himself various times, but of course he doesn't dies. While funny on screen, it is not funny in real life. Don't get me wrong this movie can actually be funny and even at times clever. However, it lacked magic. There was nothing that made me wish there was more (except for maybe Scamper) and very little heart. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, but don't expect ""Citizen Kane"".

When the police arrive there is no sign of the man so she goes home feeling good about saving a life. It is only later that she learns he was a killer who had shot a man moments before! She meets the man again when he helps her with her Christmas tree although she has no idea who he is. They gradually become friends although the police haven't lost interest in Kate; mostly because one of the officers is hoping for a less then professional relationship with her. When Kate's husband returns claiming to have found God she is scared and tells the police but it is Frank who 'deals' with him<U+0085> it is only a matter of time before she discovers the truth about him and when she does will she be safe?The packaging for this suggests a thriller with a fair amount of action; in fact we only see Frank kill two people and those are in early scenes designed to show his character rather than to be exciting. There are no chases, shootouts or explosions and the small number of deaths that occur later are off-screen; we just see them as they are found. This is far more a character study as we get to know Kate and Frank as they in turn get to know each other and their secrets. Kelly Macdonald is delightful as Kate; nicely capturing her character's nervousness. Michael Keaton is equally good as Frank the suicidal hit man<U+0085> he also does a fine job directing; I wouldn't have guessed this was his first film in that role. Despite the title this is not exactly a merry film although there are a few gentle laughs to be had. Overall a good film for those who don't need lots of action and don't need to see everything wrapped up neatly at the en"
Prom Night             ,videozombi,1,horror,2008,1,"I went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie I couldn't have been more let down. Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around. Sadly, Prom Night is about on the same quality level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.From beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. The laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key ""thrilling"" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie. Which in retrospect, I wish I had done. Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. Needless to say It didn't. The ""horror"" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the ""special effects"" and the camera work. The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere. This movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed."
Fly Me to the Moon 3D             ,RichardSRussell-1,0,animation,2008,3,"1st the good news. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks. The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story: Buzz Aldrin.And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLIES, for krissakes! Flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless. Remember when I likened the ""Underworld"" movies to rats vs. cockroaches? That wasn't intended as praise, and I never dreamed anyone would take it literally. This one's got even less empathy going for it. Baby maggots? Ugh. In one of those odd confluences of Hollywood groupthink, this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as ""Space Chimps"", also about critters in space.Go rent ""Apollo 13"" and see a 9-rated movie about the REAL space program (RIP)."
Beverly Hills Chihuahua             ,mbwright-1,1,adventure,2008,10,"I have been reading comments on this movie. Have you even seem it or just knocking it? If you want to knock a movie why not try a movie that show a man in his fifties and sixties acting like he is in his twenties or thirties. look at the one this year and last with Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and Stallone for just a few. At their age as i should know they would be in ICU after a fight. The special effects that it takes for the stunts that you know could not be done any other way but in a movie at their age or any other age could not be done. So if you like these types of movies and can suspend logic and go with you imagination and let go and have good clean fun then it is Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Oh by the way my type of movie is Horror and Scifi. Another question if it is not for the Abbie reason you dislike the movie is it because you know there are people who treat their pets like in the movie? Well for this i will take the word of Papi in the Teaser Trailer..JEALOUS."
Igor             ,gavin6942,0,animation,2014,5,"Animated fable about a cliché hunchbacked evil scientist's assistant (John Cusack) who aspires to become a scientist himself, much to the displeasure of the rest of the evil science community.""Igor"" is the first animated feature film produced by Exodus Film Group and the French CGI animation studio, Sparx*. Work was split between the studio's Paris and Vietnam facilities, and despite a large array of celebrity voices, the film ended up becoming rather obscure. While not a smashing success, the film did earn a small profit. (This would also likely be the last film from Sparx*, as they were acquired by Virtuos shortly after.) Rotten Tomatoes writes, ""With an animation style that apes Tim Burton, and a slew of cultural references that aren't clear enough to reach the crowds, Igor's patched together antics make it hard to see who the film is trying to please."" This sums it up very nicely. The animation is clearly Burton-inspired (the king looks an awful lot like Halloween's mayor), and much of it was hit and miss. Fun, yes, but never a home run. Trying to pinpoint where it went wrong is difficult, though... something just feels of"
The Strangers             ,dannyg4,,horror,2008,10,"Saw the screening for this film and it was truly terrifying. The whole audience was screaming at parts and there are several scenes that make you jump. The tension buildup during the movie is incredible. Some of the scenes are disturbing but not overly gory. Liv Tyler does a convincing job of making you feel the fright and a lot of the acting is non-verbal. Scott Speedman also does an excellent and believable job. With todays crazy headlines, this is the kind of movie that you can actually imagine happening somewhere in this country in real life. Trust me, at the end of this movie you will be double checking the locks on your doors and windows. 4"
Julia             ,jlongstreth-1,1,crime,2010,8,"An outstanding film, Julia is full of improbable plot twists, failures, missteps, and desperation.Tilda Swinton stars as a woman at the end of her rope and probably, at the end of her life. Her despair and desperation in the throes of alcoholism are so real and so painful to watch. Julia is in pain from which she'll never recover, pain she's stopped trying to recover from because it's just too hard. Then Julia gets an offer she can't refuse. A sane, rational person would recognize the insanity and illogic from the beginning, but Julia is not sane or rational. And so the journey begins.Fantastic acting by the entire cast, and Tilda Swinton shines above them all. Gritty and realistic sets that reflect the characters in them to perfection. Relentless plot twists and turns that leave you wondering when Julia will take that final step of desperation. A slow blossoming of tenderness in a swamp of despair, an unexpected scene of real love where you thought love could never be, and then, you're thrown off the train at last.Highly recommended."
The Lucky Ones             ,pc95,,adventure,2010,8,"I wasn't sure if I liked ""The Lucky Ones"" from the opening moments - it seemed a little implausible and contrived, but over the runtime the movie settled into some interesting character development and story. I liked the directors willingness to keep it low-key and quirky. (spoiler) One of the better scenes in the movie was the party, where we finally listen to some serious conversation and reflection on the current wars. The dialog is well written here, as you start to see the unwarranted and sneering ridicule that comes out misdirected at US Servicemen. The detractor/anti-war character in the conversation demonstrates the idiocy of protesting a war to people in the service. The actors all do good jobs, and by the end the eventuality doesn't seem surprising but highly fitting. Good movi"
Nights in Rodanthe             ,khlav41-1,1,drama,2008,9,"I'm hearing a lot from people reviewing this movie that it was unexpected and uncharacteristic of the two to be paired together...but isn't love unexpected and uncharacteristic? I think that is the beauty of this movie, it makes the viewer dream. Anything is possible and you should hold out for the love that makes you a better person, much like Diane Lanes character states. I think this movie is a notebook for the older generation. While in the notebook we see two people growing old together, starting out their lives and meeting each other at an early age. This movie shows that love has no expiration date, that you are never too old to fall in love. When he doesn't show up, i knew he had died because that part i believe is predictable, but i liked how they had the son come tell her, that it was personal and wound back to what Adrianne had told Paul, to go to the house and acknowledge that the person had lost someone special. This movie is a love story for all ages and I give it a 9. Go see it, it was a great movie"
Fireflies in the Garden             ,gradyharp,0,drama,2012,7,"FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN is a perplexing movie. The story seems as though someone threw the script up in the air with the fireflies in the garden (a quite beautiful moment in the film that suggest the night gardens of John Singer Sergent's 'Carnation Lily, Lily Rose'), shot it full of holes and then reassembled it the next groggy morning. Pieces are simply missing: we are informed that the original version is 122 minutes while this version is only 89 minutes and it is likely that in the missing 33 minutes many of the unresolved and very confusing elements of time and place and character development and perplexing moments existed. Writer/Director Dennis Lee obviously had a fine story to share and a brilliant cast to offer it, but so much of it is missing that we are left frustrated.Successful Romance novelist Michael Taylor (Ryan Reynolds) has completed his latest novel, a work of serious memoir literature in which he has recounted his childhood in an attempt to free himself from the influence of his demonic father, English professor Charles Taylor (William Dafoe) who seriously abused Michael as a child and for whom he holds little emotion but disdain. Michael has returned home for the college graduation of his sister Ryne (Shannon Lucio) as well as his mother's - Lisa (Julia Roberts) - deferred graduation. But the celebration is altered by an accident: Charles swerved to not hit his nephew Christopher (Chase Ellison), hit a pole resulting in a crash that killed Lisa and injured Charles and leaves Christopher with a dark cloud of guilt that he caused the trauma.We gradually meet the family: Lisa's sister Jane (Emily Watson) is the mother of Christopher and his little sister and has always been the closest friend of Michael when they were children (as children, Michael is portrayed by Cayden Boyd and Jane by Hayden Panettiere ), At Lisa's funeral Michael's 'ex-wife', AA reformed Kelly (Carrie-Anne Moss) shows up to add to Michael's angst. From here the film jumps back and forth between the childhood of Michael and Jane and the suffering and abuse Michael endured at the hands of his grotesquely diabolical father and the secrets of that failed family life are gradually exposed and the traumatic present. In cleaning out Lisa's things Michael discovers some information that alters his view of his past, and those discoveries lead to a change in the way Michael views his father and Jane's children and most significantly the demons that have burdened him through his life. In addition to the fine work by Reynolds, Watson, Dafoe, Roberts, and all the other cast members, there is an important cameo for Ioan Gruffudd that opens the murk of the story well. Though this journey through the progress of a dysfunctional family has been done many times before and even frequently using the protagonist as a novelist about to open the secrets of the family's lives to the world, this story take some significant alternative routes that make it more tender. The uses of flashbacks could have been better edited so that the audience is aware of when the character changes occur, and there are many unanswered questions about how each of these characters came to inhabit the human roles they present here. But given the fact that the audience must stay completely alert during this film in order to follow this at times meandering story, this is a worthy film. One wonders why the missing 33 minutes were not included in the American release (the film was made in 2007 and it seems as though it never played the theaters, going instead directly to DVD). With a cast of this caliber this should have been a popular film. But where did those missing pages take us? Grady Harp"
The Objective             ,chris-609-584560,,horror,2009,2,"There's a bit of a spoiler in here... Great start that appeared to be building to something. Must have missed it, or the tagline that said ""It'll all make sense once you have seen the next movie"". What a letdown! As the credits rolled up I was left with the feeling of ""Eh?"" and that was about it... Some are going to like it, but I feel that a storyteller's job is to tell the story. If the writer/Director is good enough, then questions can be great! Not this movie, though... I can't get the thoughts out of my head that it could have been a good movie. The use of landscape was great, the good guys could get killed and didn't always shoot straight and the beginning was intriguing. Sorry - I've come back full-circle - ""Eh?"""
